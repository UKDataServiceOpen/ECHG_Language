Methods: We compared MFSIQ on children of affected parents from Philadelphia (N ,26) and Leuven (N ,26), assessed using the age appropriate Wechsler Intelligence Scale, in those with familial v. de novo deletions and maternally v. paternally inherited familial deletions. Wethen compared this data to de novo cases where research based PO studies were completed (N ,57) in NY. Results: MFSIQ (66.4) for familial deletions was statistically lower (p ,.01) than for de novo deletions (N,399, MFSIQ ,76.2). MFSIQ for children with mater nally inherited deletions (63.7) was statistically lower (p,.03) than for paternally inherited deletions (72.0). As compared with the NY cohort where the MFSIQ for maternal deletions (N ,37, MFSIQ ,73.41) was no different (p,0.67) than paternal deletions (N ,20, MFSIQ ,75.2). Conclusions: Our ï¬ndings con ï¬rm the association of lower FSIQ scores in familial versus de novo 22q11.2 deletions. We also observed the novel association of lowerMFSIQ scores in maternally v. paternally inherited familial deletions in contrast to de novo deletions where no difference was observed based on PO. Thus, a maternallyinherited familial deletion is a signi ï¬cant risk factor for poorer cognitive outcome.

Trisomy X (TX) is the most common chromosomal abnormality (est. 1:1000 females) with a variablea phenotype, commonly associated with renal/urogenital abnormalities, developmental del ay, depression, autism, schi zophrenia and cerebral cortex hypo /hyperplasia. In this regard,we have retrospectively validated this biomarker in prenatal aneuploidy screening in a representative Czech cohort. Material and Methods: ADAM12 S serum levels were measured in 1534 frozen maternal sera by Del ï¬a ADAM12 research kit (Perkin Elmer) using time resolved ï¬uoroim munoassay (within 9th 18th weeks of gestation) atpercentile level distribution <5, 6 10, 11 25, 25 49, 50, 51 75 and 76 100. We assessed screening ef ï¬cacy of autosomal (70) and heterochromosomal (30) aneuploidies. Results and discussion: Levels of ADAM12 in all percentile categories were increasing by 15 ng/ml/day (p<0.000001). Detection rates in category <25th percentilefor T21 was 46.67% (45 cases), for T18 57.14% (7), T13 100% (7), triploidy 100% (10), TX 87% (8), monosomy X 12.5% (8) and monosomy X mosaic 16.66% (6). Conclusions: Although ADAM12 does not satisfactorily detect T21, it is sensitive for the detection of T13, triploidy and TX. Decreased ADAM12 levels could be due to defective Xchromosome inactivation, as ind ependently suggested by XIST overexpression associated with psychiatric disorders and TX. Signiï¬cantly decreased ADAM12 levels are a ssociated with placental dysfunction and impaired CNS differentiation. Only ADAM12 enables prenatal scree ning of developmental andpsychiatric disorders related to TX, and fosters their early prevention and eventually also therapy.

28542,"1Medical University Varna, Varna, Bulgaria,2University Hospital St. Marina, Varna, Bulgaria Introduction: Amniocentesis is the most widely used method of prenatal cytogenetic diagnosis for its high sen sitivity though the risk from the manipulation. Data show that 50% of all clinically recognized pregnancies are due toaneuploidy and 5% structural chromosomal abnormalities (SCA). Materials and Methods: Cytogenetic study was per formed in 721 samples of amniotic ï¬uid and 19 from ï¬broblasts. Karyotype was analyzed on GTG banded metaphases on cultures of amniocytes and ï¬broblasts, according to the standard protocol. Results: Overall abnormality rate in amniocytes was 4,32%, mainly with high maternal biochemical risk. Thesewere trisomy 21 (2,2%), trisomy 18 (0,6%), chromosome numerical and SCA 3 (0,4%); 1 (0,14%) with unbalanced karyotype; 1 (0,14%) a carrier of two different transloca tions. SCA were identi ï¬ed in 5 (0,7%) cases indicated for familial rearrangements: 2 balanced translocations, 2 inversions and 1 derivative chromosome, due to three waytranslocation in the father. Ultrasound data on aneuploidy enabled the detection of 1 fetus (0,14%) with combined numerical and structural karyotype of paternal origin. The pathology In the ï¬broblasts was 36,8%: trisomy 18, mosaic translocation 21, one trisomy 11, 13 and 16 and mosaic trisomy 2. Conclusion: Nowadays amniocentesis is still a feasible tool for detecting structural chromosomal aberrations in 1,4%, which NIPT would fail to diagnose. Analyzing theresults of amniocentesis helps us to determine prenatal detection rate of chromosomal aberrations and proper genetic counseling of pregnant women.

CHRFAM7A , a hybrid gene con taining a partial duplication of CHRNA7 , has been shown to modulate Î±7 nAChR function. The aim of this study was to investigate the role of CHRNA7 andCHRFAM7A genetic variants in ND and to test the hypothesis that Î±7 nAChR variation may modulate the ef ï¬cacy of varenicline treatment in smoking cessation. Methods: We assessed CHRNA7 andCHRFAM7A copy number, CHRFAM7A exon 6 Î2bp polymorphism, and sequence variants in the CHRNA7 proximal promoter in an Italian sample of 408 treatment seeking smokers. We conducted case control and quantitative association ana lyses using two smoking measures (cigarettes per day, CPD,and Fagerstro Ìm Test for Nicotine Dependence, FTND). Next, driven by the hypothesis that varenicline may exert some of its therapeutic effects through activation of Î±7 nAChRs, we restricted the analysis to a subgroup of 142 smokers who received varenicline treatment. Results: The CHRNA7 promoter variant rs28531779 showed association with both smoking quanti tative measures (FNTD p ,0.027, CPD p ,0.012). More over, in the varenicline treated subgroup we observedassociation of CHRFAM7A copy number with six months smoking abstinence (p ,0.035). Conclusions: Our study points to a possible role of genetic variation in CHRNA7 andCHRFAM7A in tobacco addiction mechanisms and response to varenicline treatment.

These can be balanced rearrangements (BR) which are not causing a chromosomal loss/gain or unbalanced rearrange ments (UR) that result in loss/gain of genes at the break points. These gene changes can cause fetal anomalies. It is important that URs can be de novo or occurring because of BRs of parents. Here we report a fetus with partial trisomy 4 and t(2;16) due to maternal complex rearrangement. Clinical Report: A couple, a 22 year old female and a 32 year old male, both in good health, was referred for genetic counselling following an abnormal fetal sonogram. This was the couple âs second pregnancy following one ï¬rst trimester miscarriage. They were non consanguineous parents. In the family history, mother âs parents had an ex preterm infant.

Here we present validation of a method analysing unextracted cfDNA direct from maternal plasma in a diagnostic lab. Method: Our current protocol involves duplicate cfDNA extractions (QIAsymphony SP) from 2ml of double spun874 J. del Picchiaplasma followed by detection of the SRY and CCR5 genes by quantitative real time PCR (Q/RT PCR) (Taqman, ABI 7300). We identi ï¬ed 100 stored plasma samples from high risk pregnancies of 7 10 weeks gestation with fetal sex tested previously and clinically con ï¬rmed. Up to thirteen 80ul plasma samples with controls were tested perCell3â¢Direct: Fetal Sex Determination kit (Nonacus, UK) which detects the SRY, TSPY, DAZ and CCR5 genes by multiplexed Q/RT PCR. Results: Thresholds for classi ï¬cation of male or female were established. 89 of the 100 plasmas analysed showed conclusive concordant results ï¬rst time. This includes 10 of the 13 previously reported inconclusive by our standard protocol and 5 samples below 9 weeks gestation. Of the remaining 11 plasmas, these showed concordance withrepeat testing. Conclusion: This ï¬rst direct from plasma, non invasive prenatal test to determine fetal sex is more sensitive than thestandard protocol. Removal of the extraction step reduces time, consumables and labour costs. The reduced plasma volume requirement allows for a smaller blood collection orfor further testing if required.

Preventive folate consumption by cou ples, pregnant women and anticoagulants treatment inclinical cases provided by many national guidelines. But the relationship between these components (when genetically determined thrombophilic disturbances started) in coupleswith reproductive disorders has not been studied enough. Materials and Methods: 170 couples (female/male) with reproductive disorders (primary infertility/early pregnancyloss) examined. There were investigated folate related genes polymorphism: MTHFR (C677T; A1298C), MTRR (A66G),MTR1 (A2756G); folate metabolism (plasma homocysteine/ serum folate levels) and coagulation parameters (activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), prothrombin time (PT), thrombin time (TT), ï¬brinogen level). We collected data about folic acid consumption and life style (including smoking, diet, coffee, physical activity). Statistical analysesdone used Pearson's correlation and binary logistic regres sion (SPSS_17.00). Results: Plasma homocysteine levels signi ï¬cantly corre lated only with serum folate levels of investigated patients. Serum folate levels signi ï¬cantly correlated with additional folate consumption and coagulation parameters (APTT, PT,TT and ï¬brinogen levels).

In ï¬rst two missed abortions genetic analysis from aborted material was not done, but in third one karyotypic analysis revealed trisomy of chromo some 16 (20 mitosis). In fourth missed abortion the same karyotypic abnormality was detected again, with the fragile site on the long arm of two chromosomes 16 (fra(16)(q22)[10]).

Abstracts from the 51stEuropean Society of Human Genetics Conference: â¦ 875Material and Methods: After analysis of constitutional karyotypes of the partners, we found abnormalities of chromosome 16 in the karyotype of the woman: deletion of 16q22 was found in two mitosis while fragile site of one of the chromosome 16 was seen in 5 mitoses. The rest of 42 mitoses analysed were normal. The karyotype wasdescribed as follow: 46,XX,del(16)(q22)[3]/46,XX,fra(16) (q22)[5]/46,XX[42]. Fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) method with the probe for 16q22 (Abbott, Vysis,CBFB BreakApart probe) showed deletion of the 5 âregion of the CBFB gene in all of the nuclei/metaphases analysed . In addition, array CGH analysis performed in the womanshowed no aberration in 16q22 region, while the next generation sequencing analysis has not been started yet. Conclusion: To exclude any possibility of trisomy of chromosome 16 in further pregnancies, we suggested in vitro fertilization (IVF) followed by preimplantation genetic screening of embryos (PGD).

28553,"1Institute of Molecular and Cell Biology, University of Tartu, Tartu, Estonia,2Women's Clinic of Tartu University Hospital, Tartu, Estonia,3The Competence Center on Health Technologies, Tartu, Estonia During folliculogenesis the oocyte is surrounded by gran ulosa cells (GCs), that are crucial to its development and maturation. The oocyte is not capable of some metabolicprocesses and needs nutritional support from granulosa cells. They provide the oocyte with growth factors, hor mones, and cytokines. Long term culturing and testing ofprimary granulosa cells would help to reveal granulosa related fertility problems. There is still need for more ef ï¬ cient and de ï¬ned conditions for studying these cells. Our aim was to develop serum free culture conditions which would support long term cultivation of primary granulosa cells. Primary luteinized human GCs were cultivated in serum free growth media containing either no growth factors,IGF2, FGF2, or both, up to 24 days. The expression levels of GC markers were analysed by qPCR. The expression of FSHR increases while AMHR level does not signi ï¬cantly change during the ï¬rst four days of culture but start to decrease after that. The expression of LHR andCYP19A1 decreases during time of cell culture. CYP19A1 is expressed very highly at the starting point but starts decreasing rapidly in cell culture. After four days the expression drops about 2 5 folds. Currently, this cell culture protocol could be used for short term GC culturing. For long term experiments adding additional hormones like FSH is currently being tested tosee if that might help to maintain GC identity. K. Hensen: None. M. Pook: None. A. Sikut: None. T.

However, hypospadias is often missed on prenatal US, despite it being the most common congenital defect of the male externalgenitalia. The prenatal recognition of hypospadias is important because it will alert the physician to order kar yotyping and to look for any possible associated dys morphic syndromes. Materials and Methods: 16 patients neonatally diag nosed hypospadias between 2007 and 2017 were analysedretrospectively based on obstetrics/neonatal chart and ultrasound data. Results: Regarding the type of hypospadias, 15/16 were distal hypospadias and only one case was diagnosed as mid shaft hypospadias. We did not have severe type of hypospadias during 10 years. In total, 8/16 (50%) caseswere diagnosed prenatally with ultrasound examination. All the case prenatally diagnosed had other ï¬ndings such as FGR, CHD. There were two cases diagnosed as syndromiccondition neonatally such as ATR X syndrome and Noonan syndrome and three other syndromic conditions were still on the genomic analysis. Conclusion: Some reported that severe type of hypospa dias could be easier to pick up at prenatal ultrasound examination, however out prenatally diagnosed case wereall mild type. It is most important that we have to be aware that those patients might have other complicated conditions876 J. del Picchiaand look carefully as neonates as well. In Japan, most of pregnant women want to know the fetus âs sex, however prenatal ultrasound scans should include a study of the genitals and should not only be used for sex determination. A.

Patients have 46,XX karyotype, yet they have male external genitalia and male identity. Theyhave hypogonadism, gynecomastia and azoospermia. Majority of patients have SRY gene translocated to Xp or an autosome. Up till now more than 250 patients have beenreported. Here we present 9 more cases. Methods: Clinical and laboratory ï¬ndings (hormone proï¬le, sperm analyses) cytogenetics, FISH (SRY CEPX) and Y microdeletion analysis were studied; genetic results were correlated with clinical and laboratory parameters. Results: Mean height was below the mean height of normal Turkish men (166.7 cm versus 174.3 cm); mean age and weight was normal. All cases had a decreased testicular volume, all had male phenotype. All patients hadhypergonadotropic hypogonadism and azoospermia. 6/9 patients had a decreased pubic and axillary hair. 3/9 patients had gynecomastia. 6 of 9 patients had 46,XX, 3 patients hadY to X translocation. In FISH analysis SRY gene have been located on Xp. Y microdeletion analysis revealed that AZFa, AZFb, AZFc and AZFd regions were deleted butSRY was present in all patients. Conclusion: All of our patients had a SRY component. All had azoospermia, gonadotropine levels were high in allof them. All cases presented with male external genitalia and hypogonadism in contrast to SRY( ) tDSD which presents mostly with ambiguous genitalia. Azoospermiawas suggested to be the result of AZFa,b,c and d region deletions. O. S. Akar: None. G. Ogur: None. U. Abur: None. R. Asci: None. E. Altundag: None. H. S. Aymelek: None. M. K.

Isochromosome Xq on the other hand, is a rare variant ofKlinefelter syndrome, accounting approximately 0.3% of all KS and associated with normal height and androgenization compared to classical KS. Here we present another case ofisochromosome Xq variant of KS with similar clinical and cytogenetic ï¬ndings with the few cases reported before. Materials and Methods: 25 years old male patient referred to our clinic with complaint of infertility. He is son of a consanguineous couple who are ï¬rst cousins and there was no family history of reproductive dif ï¬culty. In physical examination synophrys, prominent ear and small testicles noted. His height, weight and secondary sexual character istics were within normal range. The patient âs spermiogram showed azoospermia and scrotal USG revealed testicular atrophy with heterogenity in paranchyma. Results: Karyotype analysis using G banding resulted as 47,X,i(X)(q10),Y and Short Tandem Repeat (STR) analysis showed no deletion in AZF and SRY loci of interest. Conclusion: Although dozens of isochromosome Xq variant of KS can be found in literature, it is our duty to expand our knowledge about this syndrome as far as possible and emphasize importance of karyotyping forpatients with reproductive diffuculty who may not have all features of a well known syndrome.

The phenotype of affected individuals ranges from lethal arthro gryposis multiplex to mild intellectual disability or autism spectrum disorder. Approximately 30 cases have been reported to date, but data on prenatal phenotype are scarce. Methods : We performed a ï¬le review of six patients (including three from the same family, and two siblings) diagnosed after birth with Schaaf Yang syndrome at our centers in a clinical setting, compiled prenatal andmolecular data, and reviewed the literature. Results : Prenatal ï¬ndings in our patients include fetal akinesia (2/6), pyelectasis (2/6), increased nuchal translu cency (1/4), intra uterine growth retardation (1/6), contrac tures (1/6), and cerebral anomalies (1/6). All were severely affected after birth with progressive contractures anddevelopmental delay. Two had severe hydronephrosis, while another had renal failure. Molecular analyses identi ï¬ed truncating variants in MAGEL2 : c.1762C>T, c.3043C>T, and c.1996dupC. We reviewed data on 33 cases reported between 2009 and 2017, including 10 with prenatal manifestations. Prenatal features include fetalakinesia (7/10), contractures (4/10), and polyhydramnios (3/10). In addition, two children without reported prenatal features were small for gestational age. Conclusions : Although Schaaf Yang syndrome can present prenatally, the features may be mild or absent. Fetal akinesia, contractures, and polyhydramnios arerecurrent, but are absent in more than 50% of cases. The syndrome should be considered when fetal akinesia or contractures are associated with growth retardation, pye lectasis or oligohydramnios. G. D'Amours: None. F. Rossignol: None. F. Rypens: None.

SYNLAB International Group, Barcelona, Spain, Esplugues deLlobregat, Spain, 2BCNatal Hospital clinic Barcelona, Barcelona, SpainIntroduction: Detection of a mosaic small marker chro mosome (SMC) represents a diagnostic challenge for pre natal diagnosis. Their clinical relevance depends on factors such as size, genetic content, and distribution of mosaicism. Herein, we present a case of low level mosaic SMC char acterized by arrayCGH allowing to evaluate and discardUPD, and to perform a more accurate genetic counselling. Patient and Results: A 38 years old woman was referred for prenatal diagnosis because of maternal anxiety. Karyotype of amniotic ï¬uid cells showed a âde novo â SMC in 20% of metaphases analyzed, from two indepen dent culture ï¬asks. C band staining was performed; the results suggested that the small marker chromosome was not composed only of heterochromatin. The CytoSure â¢ Constitutional v3 8x60k (Oxford Gene Technology, UK)was used according to the manufacturer âs protocol. The sample was analyzed as a patient once and as a control twice in order to distinguish between a real copy numbervariation from an artifact. The results were compatible with a 5.4 Mb dose increase from the 7p12.1p11.2 band. Fluorescence ""in situ"" hybridization (FISH) with a cen tromeric chromosome 7 probe was performed. Three hybridization signals were detected in 9.5% of the nuclei analyzed and the origin of the marker chromosome wasconï¬rmed as derived from chromosome 7. UPD(7) was excluded. Conclusions: ArrayCGH is a powerful tool to characterize SMCs regarding size and genes even in low level mosaics. The appropriate use of conventional and molecular cytogenetic techniques can be determinant for more accurate SMC/phenotype correlation improving the genetic counselling. B. Mendez: None. E.

Cantacuzino Hospital, Bucharest, Romania Introduction: Sonographic markers have been shown to be effective in screening for aneuploid conditions; moreover, ultrasonography is a non invasive, risk free method that can878 J. del Picchiabe used throughout pregnancy, at relatively low costs. As many of the chromosomal syndromes have similar sono graphic ï¬ndings, a de ï¬nitive diagnosis cannot be deter mined based on ultrasound alone, usually requiring follow up genetic investigations. Prenatal diagnosis of chromosome abnormalities through the analysis of amniocytes or chorionic villus samples is the standard of prenatal care. The application of chromosomal microarray analysis in routine chromosomal analysis hasrapidly and substantially increased the diagnostic yield in clinical cytogenetics. Materials and Methods: We selected three prenatal cases with minor ultrasound ï¬ndings and major structural chromosomal abnormalities. Molecular karyotyping analy sis was performed with either oligo or SNP basedmicroarrays developed for the detection of copy number alterations: microdeletions, microduplications, aneuploidy and unbalanced translocations. Results: Chromosomal microarray analysis revealed abnormal results for each of the three mentioned cases that are summarized in the table.

28560,"Kung University Hospital, Tainan, TaiwanPreeclampsia is a severe gestational complication char acterized by new onset of high blood pressure and protei nuria after 20 weeks of gestation. It is one of the leading hypertensive disorders in pregnant women, affecting 2 to 8% of pregnancies worldwide. Recently, endocrine gland derived vascular endothelial growth factor (EG VEGF) wasregarded as a critical factor for embryo implantation and placental development. Micro RNA 200 family, including miR 200a, 200b, 200c, 141 and 429, were highlyexpressed in human placenta and maternal circulation dur ing pregnancy. Both EG VEGF and miR 200 family have been shown to be associated with several pregnancy com plications, including abnormal embryo implantation, intrauterine fetal growth restriction, preterm birth and pre eclampsia. Besides, miR 200 family was predicted to targeton 5âUTR of EG VEGF. In order to investigate the roles of miR 200 family and EG VEGF in preeclampsia, we ana lyzed these miRNAs and EG VEGF expression in thepregnant women of healthy control (n ,55) and pre eclampsia (n ,33). The expression level of miR 141 and miR 200a in preeclamptic women was signi ï¬cantly higher in maternal blood (p <0.05), while EG VEGF was sig niï¬cant lower in the maternal blood and placenta of pre eclamptic women (p <0.05). Further, we veri ï¬ed miR 141 and 200a were target on 5 âUTR region of EG VEGF and affect the migration and invasion ability of trophoblast (HTR 8/SVneo). The results suggest miR 141 and 200atarget on EG VEGF and inhibit trophoblast migration and invasion, and may therefore predispose to develop pre eclampsia in human early pregnancy. M. Su: None.

The relationship between advanced maternal age and incidence of Down syndrome was initially reported more than 75 years ago. On the other hand it has beenproven that maternal age has no impact on the incidence of monosomy X in liveborns. In this study 579 unselected products of conceptions were analysed using commercially available kits for chromo somes 13, 15, 16, 18, 21, 22, X and Y (QF PCR) and for all chromosomes (MLPA)In contrast to QF PCR, MLPA isunable to detect 69,XXX triploidy. Overall 170 different trisomies, 38 monosomies X, 40 triploidies and 8 doubleaberrations were detected using MLPA or QF PCR. Using MLPA, trisomies of all chromosomes except of chromo some 1 and 19 were diagnosed and the most common trisomies were of chromosome 16, while for QF PCR the most common aberration was monosomy X. Similarly as in previously described studies, average age of women withtrisomic pregnancy was signi ï¬cantly higher than in women with euploid pregnancy (35.73 vs 33.63 p<0.005) and the difference in maternal age for euploid foetuses and foetuseswith X monosomy was insigni ï¬cant (32.73 vs 33.63, p , 0.31). Interestingly, frequency of triploidy in aborted foetuses seemed to decrease with maternal age (averageage 31.23 vs 33.63, p<0.05).

It is different from the abundant M1 macrophages existing indeciduae of spontaneous abortions. However, it is unknown what the molecular regulator of decidual macrophage dif ferentiation is. In our published studies: MPA (Medrox yprogesterone acetate; a progesterone analog with an anti inï¬ammatory property) drove macrophages differentiatingtoward a phenotype of decidual M2 macrophage; also, NLRP7 expressed in the decidualized endometrial stromal cells induced by MPA. NLRP7 has a well studied role in regulating immune responses. Therefore, this study aimed to examine whether NLRP7 plays a role in decidual mac rophage differentiation. Materials and Methods: We detected the expressions of M1 cell markers (IL 1 Î², TNF Î±, and iNOS) and M2 cell markers (IL 10, IDO, and MRC) respectively in LPS/IFN Î³ and IL 4/IL 13 inducing the PMA primed THP 1 cell line, which was either siNLRP7 knockdown expressed or LV NLRP7 overexpressed. We also examined the subtypes ofthe decidual macrophages by immuno ï¬uorescence staining in paraf ï¬n embedded the ï¬rst trimester endometrium. Results: The expressions of M1 cell markers are signiï¬cantly lower in LV NLRP7 overexpressed and higher in siNLRP7 knockdown expressed THP 1 cell line. The expressions of M2 cell markers slightly increase anddecrease in LV NLRP7 overexpressed and siNLRP7 knockdown expressed THP 1 cell line, respectively. NLRP7 expresses in IL 10 +CD68+M2 macrophage of theï¬rst trimester endometrium. Conclusions: We suggest that NLRP7 suppressed the differentiation of M1 macrophages in deciduae.

SMA is caused in more than 95% cases by recessive mutation in the SMN1 gene resulting in deï¬ciency of SMN (survival motor neuron) protein. Approximately 95 98 % of SMA patients lack both copies ofSMN1 exon 7. About 3% of carriers have SMN1 duplication in cis associated with SMN1 deletion on homologous chromosome. SMN1 duplication/deletion in ciscannot be detected by MLPA commonly used at carrier screening. We present the case of SMN1 exon 7 del carrier couple in which risk haplotype suitable for PGT M may not beunambiguously determined by direct MLPA SMN1 testing. Male partner has typical heterozygous SMN1 exon 7del genotype as well as his parents. His affected sister is homozygous. Female partner and her brother are hetero zygotes of SMN1 exon 7del, but their both parents have two SMN1 copies. We assumed that one of parents of female partner is false negative carrier âhas SMN1 duplication/deletion.

28567,"1Research Institute of Medical Genetics, Tomsk, Russian Federation,2Siberian State Medical University, Tomsk, Russian Federation Preeclampsia is a common pregnancy speci ï¬c disorder with unknown etiology. It is the leading cause of maternal and perinatal morbidity and mortality. We used a new approach to detecting genetic markers of preeclampsia based on acombination of genomic, transcriptomic, and bioinformatic methods. Our prior genome wide transcriptional pro ï¬ling of placental tissue led to a novel set of 63 preeclampsia can didate genes (differentially expressed genes, (Fold Change >1.5, FDR<0.1)). In this report, we present study on the role of variability in these genes in the genetic susceptibility topreeclampsia. We analyzed 48 regulatory single nucleotide polymorphisms (rSNPs) in 23 genes ( ANKRD37, BCL6, BHLHE40, CEBPA, CCSAP, CORO2A, ENG, GPT2,GSTA3, HK2, INHA, KRT19, LEP, LHB, NDRG1, PLIN2, PPP1R12C, RDH13, SASH1, SIGLEC6, SYDE1, TMEM136 andZNF175 ) in 519 patients with preeclampsia and 718 women with uncomplicated pregnancies from Russian, Buryat and Yakut populations using MassArray iPLEX (Sequenom). We have detected signi ï¬cant associa tions for preeclampsia with eleven rSNPs in PLIN2, BHLHE40, RDH13, SYDE1 andZNF175 genes in Russian882 J. del Picchiaand Buryat population. In Yakut population, only three genes (NDRG1, CORO2A, SASH1 ) were associated with increased risk of preeclampsia. rSNP in PPP1R12C genes was associated with preeclampsia in Buryat population only. This results demonstrate a signi ï¬cant role rSNP of placental tissue genes in susceptibility to preeclampsia indifferent ethnic groups of Russia. Integrative transcriptome based approach proved its ef ï¬ciency and may be applied to detecting new potential genetic markers of preeclampsia,which reduces missing heritability.

It is a multi systemic disorder usually recognisedby new onset of hypertension and proteinuria in the second half of pregnancy. Although the etiology of preeclampsia is not elucidated yet, the placenta plays an important role inthe pathogenesis. There are many genes and biochemical markers closely associated with placental function which is associated with preeclampsia. Materials and Methods: Low coverage whole genome sequencing data obtained in NIPT test from pregnant women was mined for identi ï¬cation of candidate genes mostly associated with preeclampsia. Maternal polymorph isms were identi ï¬ed and veri ï¬ed by Sanger sequencing. Results: We were able to determine allelic frequencies of preeclampsia associated SNVs speci ï¬cally in our popula tion. In addition, we veri ï¬ed selected polymorphisms associated with preeclampsia by conventional Sangersequencing after suggesting speci ï¬c average values. Conclusion: Population study con ï¬rmed our assumptions that using next generation sequencing and Sanger sequen cing may, at least partially, extend the possibilities of diagnostics in the ï¬eld of preeclampsia.

28569,"Centre of assisted reproduction Â«EmbryoÂ», Minsk, Belarus Introduction: Structural chromosome abnormalities may be associated with infertility, multiple miscarriage and delivery of chromosomally unbalanced offspring. Pre implantation genetic testing for structural rearrangements (PGT SR) was used to select embryos without chromoso mal imbalance for transfer. Materials and Methods: We conducted 13 cycles of IVF +PGT SR. A CGH (Illumina 24Sure +) was used to detect structural rearrangements of chromosomes and wholechromosome aneuploidies. Results: PGT SR was performed for 48 blastocysts. In 6 cycles for robertsonian translocation carriers 28 blastocystswere obtained, 13 from them had normal/balanced chromo some number (46,4%). After 4 embryo transfers 3 patients achieved pregnancy. The ï¬rst pregnancy resulted in delivery of a healthy child and 2 pregnancies are prolonging. In 5 cycles for reciprocal translocation carriers 14 blastocysts were obtained, 2 from them (from different patients) had normal/balanced chromosome number (14,3%). After 2 embryo transfers both patients became pregnant. In 2 cycles for inversion carriers we obtained 6 blastocysts, in both casesthere was one blastocyst with normal/balanced chromosome number (33,3%). One patient has ongoing pregnancy, the other one is waiting for embryo transfer. Conclusions: Transfer of embryos without chromosomal imbalances is important factor for successful implantation, pregnancy and delivery a healthy baby. IVF +PGT SR is effective method for carriers of balanced chromosomal rearrangements that can be used for the earliest prevention of hereditary pathology. O. Yacuts: None. J. Tsukerman: None. A.

Materials and Methods: A retrospective review of our amniocentesis database for the period from January 2000 to February 2018 was carried out. The karyotyping of 7975fetuses was carried out in Department of Medical Biology from the samples of amniotic ï¬uids which were sent from Department of Gynecology and Obstetrics of BalcaliHospital. A standart nomenclature has been developed to describe each of types of abnormality found in human chromosomes. Results: A total of 7975 amniocentesis specimens were processed during the study period. 545 fetuses (6.83%) had various chromosomal abnormalities. 56.33% of abnormalkaryotypes (307 cases) were numerical and 41.46% (226 cases) were structural. Both numerical and structural chromosomal aberrations were observed in 12 cases(2.20%). The ratios were as: trisomy 21 (46.90%), trisomy 18 (18.24%), monosomy X (10.42%), trisomy 13 (6.84%), Triploidy (5.21%), Klinefelter Syndrome (3.58%), TrisomyX (1.30%), XYY Syndrome (0.97%), and the others in all numerical abnormalities. The frequent structural abnormal ities were as: 46,XX/XY,inv(9)(p11;q12)/(p11;q13)(33.18%), 46,XX/XY,1qh( +)(10.17%), 46,XY,Yqh( ) (5.30%), 46,XX/XY,16qh( +)(4.86%), 46,XX/XY,9qh( +) (4.42%) and 46,XY,Yqh( +) (4.98%). Balanced and unba lanced translocations, deletions and duplications were also found in less ratio. Conclusions: According to the literature and our results, advanced maternal age is the main cause of fetal chromosomal abnormalities. Fetal chromosomal abnorm ality ratio that we found was 6.83%.

In fetuses, congenital heart defects are found 3 5 times more often. Currently, Array Comparative GenomicHybridization (array CGH) is recommended by the Amer ican College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists as a ï¬rst line test in the prenatal diagnosis of fetuses with sono graphic abnormalities especially cardiac defects. We present the results of oligonucleotide array applica tion in a cohort of 353 prenatal cases with the fetal cardiacabnormalities, detected by ultrasound scan. In all cases amniocentesis was performed at 12 24 weeks of gestation. DNA was extracted from amniotic ï¬uid and trophoblast. Array CGH was performed using 60K microarrays 8x60K from Oxford Gene Technology (CytoSure ISCA, v2 and v3). The most commonly found (56%) are aneuploidy: chromosomal trisomy 21, 18, 13 and Turner syndrome. In cases with aneuploidy, the most common heart malforma tions are atrioventricular septal defect (AVSD), ventricular septal defect (VSD), tetralogy of Fallot (TOF), atrial septal defect (ASD) and hypoplastic left heart syndrome, (HLHS).Heart defects are a characteristic phenotypic feature in common microdeletion/microduplication syndromes (34%), for example in the cases with deletion syndrome 22q11.2the most commonly defects are TOF, VSD and aortic coarctation (CAT). Rare aberrations accounted for 10% of all abnormal results. Prenatal array CGH is the only method permitting to the identi ï¬cation of all unbalanced aberrations (number and structure) with a much higher resolution than the currentlyapplied traditional assessment techniques karyotype.

Buyukkurt2 1University of Cukurova Faculty of Medicine, Department of Medical Biology, Adana, Turkey,2University of Cukurova Faculty of Medicine, Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Adana, Turkey Introduction: In the early 1990 s, FISH and, more recently, QF PCR entered to the ï¬eld of prenatal diag nosis, to overcome the need of fetal cell culturing, hence to allow rapid diagnosis of some selected chromosomal anomalies. Rapid QF PCR analysis for the common tri somies 13, 18, and 21 and sex chromosome aneuploidy is now offered in many centers to women, who undergo invasive prenatal diagnosis b y amniocentesis or chorionic villus sampling. This is usually performed in addition to the subsequent full chromosome analysis of cultured cells. Materials and Methods: The karyotyping and QF PCR were carried out to amniotic ï¬uids of 1380 fetuses from January 2013 to January 2018. The diagnosis of commonchromosomal numerical and structural anomalies were routinely performed by standard cytogenetic techniques. The QF PCR ampli ï¬cations were performed using trisomy detection kit. The results from both methods were compared in terms of structural anomalies. Results: In our retrospective study, we detected 135 cases with numerical (48/135) and structural (87/135) anomalies. The various types of structural anomalies were found with conventional cytogenetic methods in 87 cases, who,however, were found normal with QF PCR. No false aneuploidic results were observed by QF PCR method and two methods are in accordance with each other. Discussion: Aneuploidic QF PCR results were validated with cytoge netic analyses to complete the diagnosis. The QF PCR is an easier and a faster test, it has a limitation of not to be able toscan full karyotype. In conclusion, QF PCR and cytogenetic methods are important prenatal tests that completes each other. S. Kocaturk Sel: None. A. Pazarbasi: None. B. Yilmaz: None. U. Luleyap: None. O. Demirhan: None.

Durand, Ciudad AutÃ³noma de Buenos Aires, Argentina Introduction: the premutation state of FMR1 (Fragile X Mental Retardation 1) has been associated with primaryovarian insuf ï¬ciency (POI), and is the most common known genetic cause for 46,XX patients. Nevertheless, very few studies have analyzed its frequency in Latin Americanpopulations. Additionally, a relationship between alleles carrying a cryptic microdeletion in the 5 âUTR of FMR2 and the onset of POI has only been studied in one population. Our aim was to analyze the incidence of FMR1 premutations and putative microdeletions in exon 1 of FMR2 in a cohort of Argentinean women with POI. Materials and Methods: we studied 133 patients and 84 controls. Fluorescent PCR was performed, and the FMR2 exon 1 was further sequenced in samples presenting less than 11 repeats. Results: we found the frequency of FMR1 premutations to be 6.7% and 2.9% for familial and sporadic patients, respectively. Among controls, 1/84 women presented a premutation. In addition, although we did not ï¬nd microdeletions in FMR2 , we observed a change (T >C) adjacent to the repeats in two sisters with POI. Given the repetitive nature of the sequence involved, we could notascertain whether this represents a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) or a deletion. Conclusion: a relationship between FMR2 and POI could not be established for our population.

Nearly 50% RM cases remain idiopathic. A successfulpregnancy requires coordinated interaction of several com ponents between mother and fetus. It has been postulated that abnormal maternal and fetal expression of genes whichare associated with immunity, angiogenesis and apoptosis may be contributing to cases of recurrent miscarriages. Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A (VEGF A) protein isan antiapoptotic, mitogenic and major angiogenic factor and a prime regulator of endothelial cell proliferation. It plays an essential role in physiological vasculogenesis and vascularpermeability. Human leukocyte antigen (HLA) G gene is a non classical HLA class Ib gene and favours maternal acceptance of the semi allogenic fetus by modulating thematernal immune system during pregnancy. The present study determines the association of HLA G (rs41557518) and VEGF A (rs2010963) polymorphisms in 100 RM women who had experienced at least two or more con secutive miscarriages, their 100 male partners and 100 healthy control females who had at least one healthy liveborn and no miscarriage. The genotyping was performed by using AGENA MassARRAY. The variants showed dis tribution following Hardy Weinberg equilibrium (p>0.05).The variant rs41557518 showed a signi ï¬cant association (p<0.05) for recurrent miscarriages when compared between RM women and control women. Further investi gations with increased sample size may provide conclusive results about the association of these variants with recurrent miscarriages.

It has been postulated that FXIII V34L and PAI 1 4G/5G polymorphisms can interfere with ï¬bri nolysis and ï¬brin cross linking, and thus contribute to pregnancy loss. Here we examined the prevalence of aforementioned polymorphisims among women with his tory of recurrent miscarriages and fertile controls. The study included 70 women with history of at least two early pregnancy losses (before 20 thgestation week) and 30 fertile controls with no miscarriages. We investigatedpolymorphisim in FXIII (V34L) and PAI 1 (4G/5G) genes using reverse PCR Vienna lab CVD StrippAssays. Our results showed no statistically signi ï¬cant difference in prevalence of FXIII and PAI 1 gene polymorphisms between two tested groups. However, relative risk for PRL among women heterozygous for FXIII V34L was 2.81times increased (CI 95%, p 0.02). Using stepwise logistic regression analysis we showed that combined presence of high risk genotypes for FXIII and PAI 1 increases relativerisk for RPL 13.98 times (CI 95%, p 0.04). FXIII V34L polymorphism leads to change in ï¬brin structure making it more resistant to ï¬brinolysis. In combination with decreased fybrinolitic activity of PAI 1 4G variant it can lead to improper formation of placenta. Therefore, compound heterozygots for FXII V34L and PAI 1 4G can have increased risk for RPL. I. Joksic: None. G. Joksic: None. E",2018
28576,"Medical Genetics, Ljubljana, Slovenia Introduction: Recurrent miscarriage (RM) is a reproductive disorder de ï¬ned as the loss of two or more pregnancies from the time of conception until 22 weeks of gestation. Despite the fact that several mechanisms have been pre viously described for the pathogenesis of RM, causes of approximately 50% remain unknown. Recent studies indi cate association of vitamin D with adverse pregnancy out come, including RM. The vitamin D receptor (VDR) is a crucial mediator of the pleiotropic cellular effects of vitaminD and its function is in ï¬uenced by several single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). The main objective of the present886 J. del Picchiastudy was to assess whether three different VDR SNPs are associated with the risk of RM in Slovenian women. Materials and Methods: A case control study was designed to examine the potential association of VDR polymorphisms (FokI rs222857, Cdx2 rs115688, Taq1 rs731236) with RM. A total of 149 women with a historyofâ¥3 spontaneous miscarriages of unknown aetiology were included in the study. The control group consisted of 149 age matched, healthy women with at least two live births. Genotyping was performed using PCR RFLP methods. Results: No statistically signi ï¬cant differences were found in the distribution of genotype and allele frequenciesof either SNP between patients and controls or patients with primary and secondary RM. Moreover, we found no association between abovementioned SNPs and RM underdominant, recessive and codominant genetic models.

Tor Vergata, Rome, Italy,3Regional Center for Rare Diseases Academic Hospita, Udine, Italy Introduction: Tangier disease is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by mutations in the ABCA1 gene and characterized by the accumulation of cholesteryl ester in various tissues and a near absence of high density lipo protein. The subject in this investigation was a 36 year old man with Tangier disease and with a severe oligoastheno teratozoospermia diagnosis. Testosterone is the sex hor mone necessary for spermatogenesis and cholesterol is its precursor; hence, we hypothesized that the characteristic cholesterol de ï¬ciency in Tangier disease patients could compromise their fertility. The aim of the study was to therefore to determine if there is an association between Tangier disease and male infertility. Materials and Methods: After excluding viral, infec tious, genetic and anatomical causes of the subject âs oligoasthenoteratozoospermia, we performed a hormonalanalysis to verify our hypothesis. Results: The patient was found to be negative for frequent bacteria and viruses. The subject showed a normalmale karyotype and tested negative for Yq microdeletions and Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator gene mutations. A complete urological examination wasperformed, and primary hypogonadism was also excluded. Conversely, hormonal analyses showed that the subject had a high level of follicle stimulating hormone and luteinizinghormone, low total testosterone and a signi ï¬cant decline in inhibin B. Conclusion: We believe that the abnormally low cholesterol levels typically found in subjects with Tangier disease may result in a reduced testosterone productionwhich in turn could affect the hormonal axis responsible for spermatogenesis leading to a defective maturation of spermatozoa.

We report here a fetuswith a sSMC, identi ï¬ed as a ring chromosome 18, asso ciated with a cardiac defect. Patient: We present a 36 year old pregnant patient who was referred to the Center for Prenatal Diagnosis at Montpellier University Hospital for a ventricular septal defect, conotruncal type, consistent with a diagnosis oftetralogy of Fallot, revealed on 32 weeks âgestation ultrasound screening. Results: Rapid interphase screening performed on 133 uncultured amniocytes showed 58 nuclei with 3 signals for centromere 18 probe (D18Z1). Surprisingly the karyotype showed a mosaic ring chromosome 18, dicentric in somemetaphases, objectived by additional FISH analysis with D18Z1 probeConsequently, the chromosomal formula was established as follows:47,XX, +r(18)(p11.22q11.2)[19/20]/ 46,XX[1/20].ish r(18)(wcp18 +,D18Z1 +)[11/49]/r(18) (wcp18 +,D18Z1 ++)[3/49]Array CGH analysis was per formed to precise chromosomal content. It revealed thepresence of a 5.9 Mb duplication at chromosomal region 18p11.22p11.21 and a second one of 5.8 Mb at chromo somal region 18q11.1q11.2 encompassing the entire gene,GATA6 . Mutations in GATA6 are described in cases of tetralogy of Fallot and some authors argue that GATA6 gain can be observed in patients with conotruncal defect,suggesting a phenotype gene dosage relationship. Conclusion: To date, only ï¬ve cases of supernumerary ring chromosome 18 have been reported with a widephenotypic range due to variations in genetic content. In our case, we identi ï¬edGATA6 as a good candidate gene to explain cardiac defect. We suggest that molecular char acterization of sSMC may help genetic counseling and a better understanding of chromosomal imbalances.888 J. del PicchiaJ. B. Gaillard: None. A. Schneider: None. J.

Older daughter was infertile because of obstruction of the fallo pian tubes, younger daughter was unmarried. Materials and Methods: Chromosome analysis was done on peripheral blood lymphocytes. FISH analysis withthe DNA probes (DXZ1, KAL Xp22.3) was performed on peripheral blood lymphocytes and buccal smear cells. At least 100 cells were analyzed for each FISH analysis. Results: Mosaic ring (X)(p22.3q28).ish (DXZ1 +,KAL +) was detected in mother and her daughters. The patients presented 45,X/46,Xr(X) mosaicism with similar propor tions of cells containing the r(X) in the lymphocytes and buccal smear cells: 8% and 26% (mother), 9% and 40% and 11% and 47% (daughters, 32 and 25 y.o.), respectively. Theproportion of the cell lines with and with no ring X chromosome is between tissues in the same TS patient. There is a positive correlation between age and percentage(%) of r(X) in epithelia cells.

It is estimated to affect 15% of couples worldwide. Male factors contributing to infertiliy makes up around 40 50% of the cases. Y chromosome infertiliy makes up 5 10% of thecases with azoospermia or severe oligospermia. Y chro mosome infertiliy is caused by the deletions azoospermia factor (AZF) region located in proximal Yq. Purpose of this study is to determine the frequencies of AZFa, AZFb or AZFc deletions among the males with azoospermia or oligospermia referred to our laboratory forfurther evaluation between 2009 2018. Our study consisted of 1926 male patients with azoospermia or oligospermia. We used ChromoQuant Â® AZF kit to detect the deletions. For AZFa sY86 and sY84, for AZFb sY127 and sY134, for AZFc sY160, sY254 and sY255 markers were utilized. Among 1926 number of patients, 116 (6.2%) of them had at least one of AZFa, AZFb or AZFc deletions. The most common AZF deletion was AZFc deletion which wasdetected in 50.8% (n ,59) of the patients. The others were AZFb+c in 16.3% (n ,19), AZFa +b+c in 15.5% (n ,18), AZFa in 11.2% (n ,13) and AZFb in 6% (n ,7) of patients, respectively. Percentage of Y microdeletions might be higher in more select and homogeneous populations. It is hopeful thatmajority of AZF deletions were AZFc microdeletions in our study, since males with AZFc deletions have an oppurtunity for fertility via TESE. Y. Karaca: None. A. Durmaz: None. A.

The aim of our study was to investigate the potential risk AZFc microrearrangements may deliver to spermato genesis and to ascertain the possible association of Y haplogroups with distinct AZFc microrearrangements and spermatogenic impairment. Materials/methods: A total of 486 men were examined, mainly Macedonians and Albanians, among which 338 were azoospermic/oligozoospermic and 148 normozoosper mic. The AZFc microrearrangements were analyzed with STS and SFV markers, QF PCR and MLPA analysis. Additionally, we determined the Y haplogroups of allsubjects using direct SNP typing and indirect prediction with Y STR markers. Results: We observed two microdeletions: gr/gr and b2/ b3, three microduplications: b2/b4, gr/gr, b2/b3 and one complex rearrangement gr/gr del. +b2/b4 dupl. Our results did not show a statistical association of impaired sperma togenesis with microrearrangements, however a signi ï¬cant correlation of speci ï¬c rearrangements with distinct hap logroups was observed. The b2/b4 and gr/gr duplicationswere statistically associated with HgR1a (p ,7.27x10 13 and p,0.0026 respectively), whereas the b2/b3 deletions were detected almost exclusively in HgE (p ,0.0051), implying that the Y chromosome background confers susceptibility to AZFc microrearrangements. Subgroup analysis based on ethnicity revealed a signi ï¬cant difference between the frequency of Macedonian and Albanian HgR1a b2/b4 duplication carriers (p ,0.0315). Conclusion: These results are speci ï¬c to a population of Macedonians and Albanians, thus due to the perceived âregionality âof Y chromosome microrearrangemets and haplogroups this study further adds to the body of literature.

The most part of loss of function (LoF) mutations causes aniridia (absence of the iris a mong other signs) or closely related phenotypes, while the majority of missense mutations could lead to several other conditions. To make steps towards investigation of phenotype genotype cor relations, the clinical picture of 6 patients with different missense mutations in the PAX6 gene is analyzed. Materials and Methods: A cohort of patients with PAX6 missense mutations underwent ophthalmological examina tion and molecular diagnosis. Results: Two mutations cause aniridia phenotype, three others result in closely related phenotypes. A single missense is associated with iris damage different from aniridia (see Table). A carrier of the mutation also hasretinal glial layer atrophy, macula hypoplasia, abnormal retinal pigment epithelium structure, nystagmus and achromatopsia. Conclusions: A signi ï¬cant variety of clinical picture might be partially explained by different etiopathogenetic mechanisms related to the location and peculiarities ofaffected amino acid residue. Functional consequences of missense mutations are to be tested by at least in vitro analysis. This work is partially supported by RFBR grant17 04 00475.

By mid adulthood most individuals are legally blind. The ABCA4 gene encodes an ATP binding cassette transporter foundexclusively in the retina's photoreceptors. Biallelic Muta tions in ABCA4 gene cause cone rod dystrophy. Materials and Methods: We have performed exome sequencing in an individual of Jewish Bukharian origin and a family history resembles autosomal recessive with pseudo dominant trait. We performed a segregation study for the disease causing variant and screened this variant in Bukharian Jewish population. Results: A 20 year old male, currently blind with a clinical diagnosis of cone rod of consanguineous Jews of Bukharian family was referred for a genetic counseling. Family history includes maternal great uncle and daughterwith a clinical picture similar to the probed. The patient was found to have a novel homozygous mutation c.5059delA in theABCA4 gene, leading to a premature stop codon and lack of functioning protein. The parents and a sister were heterozygous carriers for the familial mutation. The c.5059delA mutation was found in 5 individuals out of169 Bukharian Jewish unrelated individuals, giving an estimated carrier frequency of 1:34. Conclusions: The prevalence of cone rod dystrophy due to this founder mutation in Bukharian Jews is expected to be about 1:4600. It is yet unclear whether this speci ï¬c mutation causes exclusively cone rod dystrophy or includes the spectrum of retinal disorders caused by other ABCA4 mutations. A. Bar Shira: None. R.

Different loss of function mutations in SCN9A gene (NM_002977.3), encoding the sodium channel Nav1.7, have been associatedwith this condition. A 10 year old girl with clinical evidences of CIP underwent the genetic analysis of SCN9A. Blood sampleswere collected from the proband, her unaffected twin and both the parents. Genomic DNA was sequenced by next generation sequencing. Transcript analysis were carried outin order to evaluate the mutation consequence on the mRNA splicing. The cDNA was ampli ï¬ed with a speci ï¬c primer set and different size fragments separated andisolated on agarose gel, then sequenced by Sanger method. We selected two mutations in SCN9A: a missense mutation p. Arg896Gln (c.2687G>A), previously describedby Cox et al. and a splicing variant c.1108 2A>G, not yet reported in public databases. The proband cDNA sequen cing showed the delocalization of the acceptor splice site 46bp downstream, within the exon 10, inducing a deletion which results in a premature stop codon. Co segregation analysis showed that the mother and brother were hetero zygous carriers of the missense mutation while the father was heterozygous for the splicing mutation. The deleterious effect of the missense mutation on the sodium channel activity is caused by the alteration of the pore delimiting structure, which is highly conserved in the evolution. The splicing mutation is a truncating mutationthat impairs the expression of Nav1.7 channel functioning, providing the explanation of the phenotype. M. Marchi: None. V. Provitera: None. M.

Until now have been described only seven patients and 7 different mutations. The clinical picture is characterized by: 1) pre and postnatal growth retardation; 2) severe microcephaly; 3)mild to moderate intellectual disability; 4) severe sensor ineural hearing loss with cochlear malformations; 5) skin pigmentation anomalies; 6) facial dysmorphisms. Case report . We report the case of two sisters (5 yo and 3Â½ yo), born to healthy and non consanguineous parents who came to our Institute for a bilateral sensorineuralhearing loss and cochlear hypoplasia. The visit highlighted hyposomia with values lower than the 3rd percentile from the prenatal age and a severe and progressive microcephaly. They showed hyperpigmented straeks and hypopigmented spots enlarging over time, and dysmorphic features: mild bilateral epicanthus, upslanting palpebral ï¬ssures, promi nent nose with small alae nasi, cup ears, micrognathia, and bilateral clinodactyly. Moreover, they showed a language delay although the IQ tests were for both of them in thenormal range. There were no cardiac or abdominal malformations. Since the cell cultures demonstrated an elevated spontaneous and mitomycin C (MMC) inducedchromosomal breakages, and sister chromatid cohesion defects, a DDX11 gene analysis was carried out, showing two novel variants (c.907_920del (p. Lys303Glufs*22) andc.2507T>C (p. Leu836Pro)) predicted to be likely pathoge netic according to the ACMG/AMP 2015 guidelines. Conclusion .

Congenital deafness with inner ear agenesis, microtia, and microdontia is caused by biallelic mutations in the FGF3 gene. Otodental dys plasia is a syndrome of sensorineural deafness and globo dontia, which has been associated with heterozygous microdeletions of chromosome 11q13 involving theFGF3 gene. Materials and Methods: For case one, FGF3 gene sequence analysis using Sanger sequencing method wasused whereas array CGH was performed for case two. Cases: Case one is a 5 year old female who was born at term by normal delivery. Her parents were consanguineous.(second cousins). She had a long face, with micrognathia, microtia, microdontia and preauricular skin tags. Case two is a one year old male who was born at term by normaldelivery. He had a long face, long philtrum, anteverted nostrils, cupped shaped ears, preauricular skin tags and single transverse palmar crease on left hand. Percentilevalues of all anthropometric measurements were between 10 and 25 in both cases and audiologic examination of both cases revealed bilateral sensorineural deafness. Results: In case one a novel homozygous c.8T>G (p. Leu3Arg) mutation was found in the FGF3 gene. Case two had heterozygous 11q13.3q13.4 microdeletion (2,804 kbp)including FGF3 gene.

In this study, we report the mutation frequency of GJB2 in 239 Hungarian NSHL patients and the phenotype comparisonbetween homozygous / compound heterozygous and heterozygous cases. Methods: The total coding region of the GJB2 gene was analyzed with Sanger or NGS sequencing for 239 patients with NSHL and 160 controls. Results: Homozygous and compound heterozygous GJB2 mutations were associated with early oneset serious NSHL in 28 patients. In 24 patients two deletion or nonsense mutation were present with prelingual NSHL,while in compound heterozygous cases with the combina tion of deletion and missense mutation associated with milder postlingual phenptype. Further 25 cases harboredsingle heterozygous GJB2 mutations associated with later oneset, milder NSHL. The most common mutation was the c.35delG deletion, with 12.6% allele frequency. Conclusion: T he mutation frequency of GJB2 is lower than other European cohort. The most serious cases associated with homozygous and compound heterozygousmutations. In our cohort the hearing impairment and age of oneset was not altered between in cases with only one heterozygous GJB2 mutations and wild type genotype, which might be exclude the opportunity of autosomal dominant inheritance.

Patients were prescreened for GJB2, microarray, imaging, TFT, CMV and haematuria/proteinuria prior to genetics assessment. Funded genetic testing was routinely offered incases where there was a family history, management or pregnancy implications, or patients could self fund. Method: We performed a retrospective review to assess rates of genetic testing and diagnosis from 2015 2017. Outpatient records were reviewed and data, including referral source, ethnicity, family history, inheritance pattern,phenotype, genetic testing, and diagnosis were extracted and analysed for individuals seen in the clinic during 2015 2017. Results: A total of 90 patients were seen, 22 received a genetic diagnosis and 7 a likely genetic diagnosis (32%). Of these gene panel or exome sequencing was performed in 42and a genetic diagnosis was con ï¬rmed or likely in 17 (40%). Cascade testing was performed in relatives of 17 probands, and demonstrated that 13 cases were inherited. 25patients had syndromic or likely syndromic causes. Discussion : This review reports on real world assessment and selection for genetic testing in hearing loss. Clinicalprioritisation for genetic testing to maximise clinical utility is appropriate within the public healthcare setting and the application of methods that ef ï¬ciently optimise outcomes for patients effectively bene ï¬t the healthcare system.

28595,"Introduction An autosomal recessive syndrome (Jalili syndrome) associating cone rod dystrophy (CRD) and amelogenesis imperfecta (AI) have been reported in litera ture. Mutations in CNNM4 have been described to cause this anomaly. The encoded protein may play a role in metal ion transport. Materials and Methods: In the present study, a clinical and genetic investigation was performed in a consangui neous family of Pakistani origin, showing typical features ofJalili syndrome. Direct Sanger sequencing was performed in affected and unaffected members of the enrolled family. Results: Sanger sequencing of CNNM4 identi ï¬ed a novel missense variant (p. Arg407Leu). The variant is predicted damaging by three in silico prediction tools [SIFT: damaging 0.01; MutationTaster: disease causing; Poly Phen 2: probably damaging 1.000)] and it is not reported in gnomAD. To address the mutational consequences in structure, mutant Arg407Leu was modelled along with thepreviously reported mutations and deciphered the binding mode of ATP with the aid of docking analysis. Furthermore, molecular dynamics simulations were executed on wild type and mutant CNNM4 to understand the structural and energetic information after 100ns production run in altering the protein structure, dynamics, and stability. It wasexamined the conformational shift of ATP binding site in Arg407Leu and binding free energy (MM GBSA) is lower than the wtCNNM4. Additionally, some important hydro gen bonds of Arg407Leu mutant are disrupted during the MD simulations which remained stable in wtCNNM4 Conclusion: T he present study gives a novel insight into the role of CNNM4 as a metal transporter in visual function and biomineralization.

28596,"2Singleton Hospital, Swansea, United Kingdom Introduction: Renal coloboma syndrome (RCS) involves renal and optic nerve abnormalities. PAX2 encodes a tran scriptional regulator. Biallelic expression of PAX2 prevents programmed cell death. Clinical features of RCS corre spond to tissue speci ï¬c expression of PAX2 during early embryonic development.896 J. del PicchiaPAX2 mutations are identi ï¬ed in approximately 50% of RCS cases and are the only identi ï¬ed genetic cause associated with RCS. Also, ten percent of children with isolated renal hypodysplasia have PAX2 mutations. Most mutations are missense, nonsense or small deletions/ duplications of a few nucleotides in exons 2, 3 and 4which encode the paired domain. Few duplications of PAX2 have been reported and have mainly been whole gene duplications. Large intragenic duplications have not beenreported in patients with RCS. Case: Aï¬ve month old boy presented with a history of renal hypodysplasia and âmorning glory âappearance of his optic nerves. He had pre axial polydactyly and distinctive facial features. Karyotype, analysis for 22q11 deletion and chromosome breakage studies were all normal. No sequen cing abnormality of the paired box domain (exons 2,3,4) and octapeptide domain (exon 5) of PAX2 was identi ï¬ed. Following a renal transplant at 8 years, Array CGH showed a de novo 13kb duplication of 10q24.31, resulting in an intragenic gain including exon 5 of PAX2 . Conclusion: We describe a child with clinical features of RCS with a novel intragenic PAX2 duplication. This is a previously unreported pathogenic mechanism for RCS. This case demonstrates the importance of considering dosageanalysis investigations when a clinical phenotype is suggestive of RCS. J. Gardner: None. O. Murch: None. D. Laws: None. A. Kamath: None.

We have found 20 cases of progressive post lingual sensorineural HL (mean age of HL onset 7.22Â±2.52 years) in indigenous peoples (Yakuts, Evens, Yukaghirs) living in subarctic part of Russia (theSakha Republic). In 13 out of 20 families we revealed segregation of HL according to autosomal recessive type of inheritance. No any pathology of other organs and systemswere found in affected individuals. Speech was preserved in 70% of affected children. However, only 10% of children were able to ï¬nish public school while most of patients attended special school for deaf children. Progressive bilateral sensorineural HL of variable degree with onset in theï¬rst seven years of life was revealed in affected children while in adult patients (over 18 years) profound deafness was registered. No any pathogenic mutations were found in other genes associated with HL: GJB2, GJB3, GJB6, SLC26A4, POU3F4 and12SrRNA which were previously found in other deaf patients in the Sakha Republic [Dzhe mileva et al., 2009; Barashkov et al., 2016; 2018; Pshen nikova et al., 2017].

STGD is predominantly inherited as an autosomal recessiveAbstracts from the 51stEuropean Society of Human Genetics Conference: â¦ 897trait. Biallelic mutations in ABCA4 are found in most patients with autosomal recessive STGD (arSTGD) as well as in some patients with autosomal recessive retinitis pig mentosa (arRP) and autosomal recessive cone rod dystro phy (arCRD). Patients and methods: In this study, we present two clinical cases of Bull's eye maculopathy with early cone degeneration and the absence of ï¬ecks studied by NGS. Genes involved in arSTGD, arRP and arCRD were studiedby INGEMM NGS custom panel, Oft v1.0, designed with NimbleDesign, target bases covered >99%. Bioinformatic analysis was carried out by the Clinical Bioinformatics Unitof INGEMM center. Results and discussion: Patient 1: ABCA4 gene, compound heterozygous: p. Gly1961Glu and p. Thr1019Met. Patient 2: ABCA4 gene, compound hetero zygous: p. Gly1961Glu and p. Asn96Thrfs*19. The p.

Nine pseudogene derived pointmutations account for about 80% of all defects in the CYP21A2 gene coding the 21 hydroxylase enzyme. Materials and Methods: DNA samples from 23 Macedonian patients with clinical and laboratory signs of LO form of 21 hydroxylase de ï¬ciency, 5 male and 18 female, were collected and subjected to polymerase chainreaction for the detection of presence of nine CYP21A2 point mutations. The patients were evaluated at the Department of Endocrinology and Genetics, UniversityPediatric Clinic, Skopje, Republic of Macedonia. Results: Five different mutations were detected in 82.6% (19/23) of the patients on 58.7% (27/46) alleles. The mostprevalent mutation was P30L, present in 17 alleles (37%), followed by the Q318X in 7 (15.2%), and V281L, IVS2 and Del 8ntG110 in only 1 (2.2%) allele, each. I172N, clusterexon 6, InsT307 and R356W mutations were not found. In 34.8% (8/23) of the patients complete genotype was revealed (P30L/P30L in 6 patients, Q318X/Q318X andP30L/Q318X in one patient, each). Eleven of the patients were heterozygotes, with no detected mutation on the second allele, and in four patients no one mutation wasdetected. Conclusions: We found high frequency of nonsense Q318X mutation, speci ï¬c for severe classical phenotype of the disease, among Macedonian LO patients.

Materials and Methods: We present two siblings with 46, XY karyotype presenting with female external genitalia at birth. Diagnosis was based upon the detection of bilateral inguinal testis in the older child in the neonatal period, anddeep voice and Adam âs apple enlargement in a second pre pubertal child. Measurement of testosterone/dihydrotestos terone was performed. Molecular analysis included multi plex quantitative ï¬uorescent PCR screening for sex chromosome aneuploidies and SRY presence, and MLPA analysis for detection of exon copy number changescombined with Sanger sequencing of exons and exons/ introns boundaries of the SRD5A2 gene. Results: Both patients were compound heterozygotes for two novel mutations in SRD5A2 gene: c.146C>A (p. Ala49Asp) point mutation in the ï¬rst exon inherited from the mother, and deletion involving entire ï¬rst exon inherited from the father. Delayed puberty in the ï¬rst patient was treated with estrogens with a poor response. Breast implantation and vaginoplasty were performed at the age20 and 22 years respectively. In the younger sister bilateral orchiectomy was performed with a consecutive slight change in the voice and disappearance of the Adam âs apple. The follow up continued up to 22 and 13 years.

Children usually present with neonatal salt wasting crisis, failure to thrive with poor feeding, hypoglycemia,vomiting, diarrhea, dehydration, shock, and generalized pigmentation. The development of gonadotropin inde pendent (peripheral) precocious puberty in male children with primary adrenal insuf ï¬ciency suggest a steroidogenic enzyme de ï¬ciency. The most frequent form of congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) is due to a 21 hydroxylase(CYP21A2) defect. We report two young boys with a similar clinical phenotype including early onset primary adrenal insuf ï¬ciency and gonadotropin independent pre cocious puberty, both negative for CYP21A2 variants. DNA from the two patients were targeted resequencing using a customized panel of genes involved in adrenal diseases and DSD. A homozygous variant in CYP11B1 and a hemizygous variant in NR0B1 were identi ï¬ed. Mutations of CYP11B1 gene reduce or abolish the activityof 11 Î² hydroxylase enzyme and cause classical CAH characterized by low cortisol levels and excessive adrenal androgen production starting during fetal life. The typical disorder of puberty in patients with NR0B1 mutations or deletions is represented by hypogonadotropic hypogo nadism, but few cases of peripheral precocious puberty,ACTH dependent precocious puberty and central pre cocious puberty have been reported. The identi ï¬ed var iants have never been reported in literature but homologymodeling of the genes demonstrate that both variants affect protein functionality.

Patients and methods: 650 men with alcohol abuse induced disorders and 220 healthy controls were included in the study. In all cases, DNA was extracted from peripheral blood using phenol/chloroform procedure and genotypedusing TaqMan 5 â exonuclease allelic discrimination assays (Applied Biosystems). Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS software. Results: No signi ï¬cant differences were found in genotype distribution for ROCK2 rs2230774 and ROCK2 rs978906 between patients with alcohol abuse or depen dence and control subjects or between alcoholics with liver disease and those without liver damage.

Department of Medical Genetics, Poznan University of Medical Sciences, Poznan, Poland Introduction: Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) is a group of inherited genetic disorders resulting from a de ï¬ ciency in one of the enzymes involved in cortisol bio synthesis. In about 95% of cases, CAH is caused bydeï¬ciency of the 21 hydroxylase, encoded by the CYP21A2 gene. More than 100 mutations in the CYP21 Î2gene have been found to cause 21 hydroxylase de ï¬ciency. Materials and Methods: Presented case concerns a 3 year old girl with congenital adrenal hyperplasia. The CYP21A2 was screened for deletion(s)/duplication(s) and subset of frequent point mutations using the multiplex ligation dependent probe ampli ï¬cation (MLPA) technique and the SALSA MLPA Kit P050 C1 CAH (MRC Holland). Results: MLPA analysis demonstrated the presence of compound two different heterozygous CYP21A2 mutations which was consist of a large heterozygous deletion of theCYP21A2 gene and the fragment of pseudogene CYP21A1P (the result suggests lower signal for all the probes complementary for CYP21A2 gene and probes complemen tary for exons 4 and 7 of the pseudogene CYP21A1P ) and smaller heterozygous deletion consisting of exons 1 3 of CYP21A2 . Conclusions: Congenital adrenal hyperplasia is a com mon disorder with genetic and clinical heterogeneity. Themolecular analysis of CAH is useful in con ï¬rming the diagnosis, and provides a powerful tool in genetic counseling. On the basis of the important role of the 21 hydroxylase in the occurrence of CAH symptoms we concluded that this compound heterozygous CYP21A2 mutation may be a sound candidate for the disease causing mutation in this patient.

Up to now, 120 inactivating mutatio ns in the TG gene have been identi ï¬ed in patients with congenital goiter and endemic or non endemic simple goiter. The purpose of the present study is to identify the mutations that cause goiter andhypothyroidism in two members (siblings) of the same family. Methods: TG gene alterations were identi ï¬ed by Sanger sequencing. Additionally, other genes (TSHR, PAX8, NKX2, FOXE1, DUOX2, TG, TPO, SLC5A5, SLC26A4Abstracts from the 51stEuropean Society of Human Genetics Conference: â¦ 903IYD, DUOXA2) related with these diseases were studied by NGS. Results: Both patients inherited the c.2359C>T [p. R768*] mutation from their father, however no alteration was detected in the other allele. The absence of a second mutation in the exonic coding or noncoding (5 â²and 3 â²UTR) sequences, the promoter region or the exon/intron bound aries, suggested no additional inactivating mutation of the TG gene. Since the single mutation in heterozygosis did notexplain the phenotype, further genes related to the disease were studied by next generation sequencing analysis. These studies discovered additional mutations in heterozygosis ingenes related to thyroid dysgenesis and dishormogenesis like the c.899 2A>C mutation in PAX8, which affects the splicing process.

The predominant feature of HH is excessiveabsorption of dietary iron and its deposition in parenchymal tissues and results in cirrhosis, diabetes, skin pigmentation and testicular failure. 42 HH patients (12 females and 30males) and 106 healthy controls were screened for the Cys282Tyr, His63Asp and Ser65Cys, using polymerase chain reaction ampli ï¬cation of genomic DNA, followed by digestion with Rsa 1 and Bel 1. All patients had the fol lowing parameters: iron studies including serum Fe, ferritin and transferrin saturation, serology for hepatitis B and C,liver function tests and abdominal echography . The mean age at genotype diagnosis was 51.3 years in males and 55.3 years in females. 38 from 42 (90.5%) HH patients werehomozygous for Cys 282Tyr mutation . Three (7.1%) were compound heterozygous for Cys 282Tyr/His63Asp and one (2.4%) was for Cys282Tyr/Ser65Cys.

Recently, bi allelic pathogenic variants in NBAS were reported as a new molecular cause of ALF in infancy, leading to recurrent liver failure. Materials and Methods: we describe a male patient 2y.5m. of age with episodes of ALF. His infantile period was normal. The ï¬rst episode of ALF occurred at the age of 1y.9 m. with greatly elevated liver transaminases (ALAT and ASAT more than 1000 U/L), succeeded by sever coagulopathy without jaundice. Alkaline phosphatase wasnormal, gamma GT was slightly elevated. Blood amino acids, acylcarnitines and very long chain fatty acids pro ï¬le were normal. Organic acids in urine were normal. He hadno extrahepatic symptoms. Over 6 months 5 episodes of ALF without fever occurred. After liver crisis, liver function completely repairs and remained normal in the interval. Results: NGS was used to analyze 47 genes responsible for hereditary diseases with predominant liver damage. Two nucleotide variants in NBAS gene were identi ï¬ed: c.3928 A>G (p. T1310A) and c.4228 A>G (p. T1410A) in com pound heterozygous state. Parents and younger sibling are healthy and heterozygous for one or another mutant allele.p. T1310A is benign according to Polyphen2.2 and MutationTaster but located in the conserved region, p. T1410A is possibly damaging and located in the conservedregion. ExAc frequency of both substitutions is <0,02%. Conclusion: Two novel NBAS variants correspond to patient âs phenotype and could be the cause of infantile liver failure syndrome 2 in the patient.

It is endemic in Greek Cypriots, in whom the disease is caused by 6.3 kbp internal duplication in the CFHR5 gene. This duplication includes exons 2 and 3. Materials and Methods: The study included eighty patients with microscopic hematuria. We detected no pathogenic variants in COL4A3 ,COL4A4 and COL4A5 genes in these patients previously. Thus Alport syndromewas excluded. The CFHR5 gene was sequenced using sequence capture based next generation sequencing tech nology. Copy number variation analysis was also per formed. Polymerase chain reaction and 5% polyacrylamid gel electrophoresis were used to detect the Cypriot duplication. Results: The Cypriot duplication was not detected in any of the patients. Neither pathogenic variants, nor large exonic deletions or duplications were found using next generationsequencing technology in the patients. Conclusion: The CFHR5 nephropathy is not a frequent cause of hematuria in Czech non Alport families.

Materials and Methods: A 35 year old male with a maternal origin family history of renal failure, with unspeci ï¬ed kidney disease, was referred to us for genetic testing. The clinical description was not indicative of aspeciï¬c gene target therefore, clinical exome sequencing was recommended. Following preparations according to the manufacturer âs protocol (SOPHiA Genetics), DNA libraries were sequenced on a NextSeq 500 NGS system (Illumina). Data were analyzed by a bioinformatics pipeline (Sophia906 J. del PicchiaDDM). A gene panel consisting of 101 genes associated with nephropathies was created to ï¬lter variants related to the phenotype investigated. Results: The analysis revealed 3 variants of unknown signiï¬cance (VUS) in the PKD1 (c.12817C>T and c.11246G>A) and ANKS6 (c.1360G>A) genes. Proband âs affected and unaffected family members were subsequently tested and the analysis revealed that the two VUS alleles in the PKD1 gene co segregated with the investigated phenotype, while the ANKS6 variant was also found in healthy individuals. Discussion: Even though further investigation is required to reach de ï¬nite genetic diagnosis, this case highlights the utility of clinical exome sequencing in clinical practice. Clinical exome sequencing can support de ï¬nitive diagnosis or clarify differential diagnosis cases in patients with renal diseases of unknown etiology, contributing to precise prognosis, systematic monitoring, and when appropriate,identi ï¬cation of other family members, as well as the possibility of family programming with pre implantation genetic diagnosis.

Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia (CAH) due to 21 hydroxylase de ï¬ciency (21 OHD) is an autosomal recessive disorder with impaired synthesis of cortisol and aldosterone and oversecretion of androgens from the adrenal cortex. We present a patientwho has a clinical pre diagnosis of CAH but underwent sequence analysis and he was diagnosed as PAIS. Materials and Methods: A consultation was requested from the medical genetics clini cf o ras i x d a y o l dn e w b o r n with diagnosis of CAH. Bi ï¬d scrotum, hypospadias and pigmentation of the areo lae and genital skin were detected in physical examination. Free testesterone and 17 hydroxyprogesterone levels were high. Karyotype analysis was done and then reverse dot blot and MLPAanalyses of 21 hydroxylase gene and sequence analysis of the subject's AR gene were performed. Results: The patient's karyotype was 46,XY. Molecular genetic analysis show a heterozygous mutation c.841G>T of the 21 hydroxylase gene and a hemizygous point mutation c.1174C>T(pPro392Ser)of the AR gene. Conclusion: Hormonal levels and hyperpigmentation of the patient were misleading in diagnosing. Whether thecombination of heterozygous CAH and hemizygous AR mutations may affect the phenotype was discussed by considering the clinical, radiological and biochemicalï¬ndings of the patient.

In solid organ transplantation,culturedtissue cells were presumed as passenger leukocyte free which ensures prolonged graft survival. The aim of this study was to evaluate the potential changes of HLA class IImRNA and protein expression levels during parathyroid cell culture. Materials and Methods: Parathyroid hyperplasia tissues were obtained from patients who diagnosed with secondary hyperparathyroidism (n ,11).After histopathological con ï¬rmation,glands were digested using collagenase type II and cultured. Afterwards, cells were collected at day 0(after isolation) and 3,6,9 respectively.

Our aim was to study the association of those variants with the development of cirrhosis in Serbian patients. Materials and Methods: A total of 103 patients with clinically diagnosed cirrhosis and 103 age and sex matched controls without clinical or laboratory evidence of liver disease were genotyped for TM6SF2 and PNPLA3 using PCR RFLP methodology. Data analysis was performed using IBM SPSS Statistics 21.0. Results: The prevalence of GG genotype of PNPLA3 gene was 50% in the group of patients and 21% in control group. We found signi ï¬cant association between GG genotype and cirrhosis (OR 3.8; 95%CI 2.06 6.98;P<0.0001), as well as between G allele and disease (OR 3.09; 95%CI 2.07 4.62; P < 0.0001). There was nosigniï¬cant association between TM6SF2 genotypes and cirrhosis (OR 1.75; 95%CI 0.82 3.72; P ,0.1444), but we observed a signi ï¬cant association between minor T allele of TM6SF2 and alcohol related cirrhosis (OR 2; 95% CI 1.05 3.8; P,0.0336).

It is a rare idiopathic disease with ï¬rst symptoms of dyspnea (respiratory distress), dry cough andchest pain due to pneumothorax. Here we present two Turkish consanguineous families af ï¬icted with PPFE. Materials and Methods: Candidate disease loci in family 1 was detected (LOD score >2.52) by linkage mapping using SNP genotype data of parents and three affected and one unaffected sib. Exome sequencing for onepatient from each family was evaluated for rare variants and variants in telomere related genes ( TERT ,TERC ,RTEL1 and PARN ) implicated in PPFE aetiology in some families. Lastly, genes harbouring rare or novel heterozygous or homozygous variants in both patients were evaluated as possible risk factors. Results: In family 1 we identi ï¬ed novel/rare homozygous variants in FAM35A and TNKS2 and possibly a hetero zygous variant in either FAM22A orFAM22D which are paralogs in a large duplicated region. All variants were predicted as disease causing by computational algorithms. TNKS2 c.1146A>T segregates with the disease, and FAM35A c.540_541insCC will be validated. No candidate variant was found in telomere related or the common genes with variants. Conclusion: We had hypothesized that PPFE was a monogenic disease and we would be able to identify the908 J. del Picchiaresponsible gene. However, we could not discriminate whether FAM35A orTNKS2 variant is causative. TNKS2 interacts with telomere related proteins and is highly conserved among species.

It was shown that TCF7L2 was associated with a subset of children with t1d (with fewer markers of islet autoimmunity) and children with t1d who carried thers7903146 Ð¢T genotype were less likely to carry high risk HLAII genotypes. The aim of this study is analysis of association rs7903146 Ð¢T and low diabetogenic HLAII genotypes among t1d children. Materials and Methods: 249 children (Russian ethnic group) with type 1 diabetes were studied. Allele identi ï¬ca tion was performed with Real Time PCR technique. HLA haplotypes DRB1*0301 DQA1*0501 DQB1*0201 and DRB1*04 DQA1*0301 DQB1*0302 were consideredhigh risk, all others low risk. The chi squared was used, and p value<0,05 were taken to indicate statistical sig niï¬cance of differences. Results: Carriers of one or two high risk HLAII haplotypes in the total sample 56%. The frequency of rs7903146TT genotype in the total sample was 7.3%.Comparison of frequencies of TT genotype in groups stratiï¬ed by HLAII showed statistically signi ï¬cant differ ences. 70% of carriers of the TT genotype did not carryhigh risk HLAII haplotypes, 10% of carriers of the TT genotype carried two high risk HLAII haplotype. Conclusions: The main genetic marker of type 2 diabetes is associated with low diabetic HLAII genotypes in children with type 1 diabetes.

Theclinical manifestation of diverticular disease can range from mild and uncomplicated to potentially life threatening inï¬ammation. Recurrent or complicated cases can involve abscess, perforation, ï¬stulizing disease and strictures/ obstruction usually requiring surgical intervention. Recent insights into the genetic background of diverticular diseasehave revealed an association between the polymorphism rs7848647 in the TNFSF15 gene and complicated diverti culitis, requiring surgical intervention. The TNFSF15 geneitself has been associated with other in ï¬ammatory bowel diseases such as ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn âs disease (CD). In this study, 30 Bulgarian patients with variousdegrees of diverticulitis have been genotyped for rs7848647 in the TNFSF15 gene via Sanger Sequencing. The per formed genetic testing has revealed that the most prevalentallele in the selected cohort is the risk allele G, further implicating the role of TNFSF15 as a factor, determining the manifestation and progression of diverticular disease. The results presented here are preliminary and a part of a larger study, aimed at investigating the effects of poly morphic variants within TNFSF15 and their relation togastrointestinal disease.

28628,"3University, Novara, Italy Introduction :Î±/Î² hydrolase domain containing protein 5 (ABHD5) is a lipid droplet associated protein that promotesthe hydrolysis of triacylglycerols (TAGs) by activating adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL). ATGL is a lipase that catalyzes the initial and rate limiting step in lipolysis byremoving the ï¬rst fatty acid from TAGs. ABHD5 gene mutations in humans lead to Chanarin Dorfman Syndrome (CDS), a rare condition in which TAGs accumulate invarious tissues, mainly skin and liver. Indeed, CDS is also known as Neutral Lipid Storage Disease with Ichthyosis, an autosomal recessive syndrome characterized by non bullouscongenital ichthyosiform eryhthroderma, hepatomegaly and liver steatosis. To date almost 110 patients have been reported, 27 of them are from Turkey. Material and Methods : We report here for the ï¬rst time, the molecular and clinical characterization of an 8 years old patient, born from affected parents. Results : No particular complications were observed during pregnancy. The child presented non bullouscongenital ichthyosiform erythroderma, hepatosteatosis, hepatomegaly and ectropion. Electropmyographic examina tion was compatible with myopathy. A cousin of the little patient, born from not affected parents, was diseased too. Leucocytes of patients, stained with May GrÃ¼nwald Giemsa, revealed lipid vacuoles. Molecular analysis showedthe homozygous N209X mutation, frequently identi ï¬ed in CDS patients. Conclusions : to date, the child does not reveal distinctive symptoms or a worsening of clinical traits in comparison with his relatives and other CDS patients. The two children started a diet poor in long chain fatty acids with MCT toimprove clinical condition and prevent severe systemic damages. S. Missaglia: None. M. Durdu: None. L. Moro: None. D.

In about 15% of cases, craniosynostosis is syndromic and multiple sutures are usually affected. Most of the syndromic patients have amutation in one of FGFR genes, that affect cell signaling e.g. RAS/MAPK pathway. Patients and methods: We present clinical evaluations of 3 patients with craniosynostosis and the clinical features of Noonan syndrome. The mutation analysis in these patients was performed using classic Sanger sequencing (2pts) orpanel next generation sequencing (1pt). Results: All patients, besides typical features for Noonan syndrome, like short stature, short neck and dysmorphicfeatures, had abnormal shape of the skull. The patient with p. Ala72Ser mutation in the PTPN11 presented with scaphocephaly, ASDII and cryptorchidism. Patients withmutations (p. Thr58Ile and p. Asp153Val) in the KRAS gene had macrocephaly and developmental delay. One of them had parietal foramina, submucous cleft palate and vertebraldefect, and the other one choanal stenosis and cryptorchidism. Conclusions: The fact that the craniosynostosis was observed in our patients with Noonan syndrome caused by mutations of genes of RAS/MAPK pathway con ï¬rms theAbstracts from the 51stEuropean Society of Human Genetics Conference: â¦ 911role of this pathway in skull formation and suture fusion.

Duane radial ray syndrome or Okihiro syndrome is an autosomal dominantly inherited disorder characterized byupper limb and ocular malformations. The disease shows a highly variable phenotype even in the same family. Materials and Methods: We report a 15 year old child with radial ray defects: clubhand deformity on the left hand, triphalangeal thumb on the right hand, hypoplasia of the left shoulder girdle. His sister has triphalangeal thumbs andhearing impairment on the right ear. His father has Duane anomaly and hypoplastic right thumb. With international collaboration, Sanger sequencing was performed on thegene SALL4. Results: A heterozygous deletion of 2 nucleotides SALL4: c.474_475delGA was identi ï¬ed in exon 2 of the SALL4 gene. The variant is a novel variant not previously described in other patients. The deletion causes a frameshift that results in a premuture stop codon (SALL4: p. Glu158AspfsX22). Due to its truncating nature, it was classi ï¬ed as a pathogenic variant. Conclusions: The above mentioned ï¬nding of a patho genic heterozygous SALL4 variant con ï¬rms the clinically suspected diagnosis of Duane radial ray syndrome. As the father has Duane anomaly and the sister radial defects, thetargeted variant is being tested in our laboratory. R. RipszÃ¡m: None. Ã. Till: None. J. Zima: None. K. Hadzsiev: None. A.

This con dition is characterised by an autosomal dominant pattern ofinheritance. The global prevalence of Loeys Dietz syn drome remains unknown. The clinical ï¬ndings are similar to those of other TGF Î² related connective tissue disorders, i.e., Marfan and Ehlers Danlos syndromes. Materials and Method: An eight year old male patient was referred to our clinic with a diagnosis of Ehlers Danlossyndrome. The patient had had previous surgery for craniosynostosis, bilateral inguinal hernia and clubfoot. The patient âs physical characteristics included low set prominent ears, a high palate, dolichocephaly, pectus excavatum, skin joint laxity, a translucent skin, micropenis and hypospadias. An ophthalmological examinationrevealed optic atrophy in the right eye. The patient was demonstrated to have aortic and pulmonary artery root dilatation ( +3 SD), mitral valve prolapse, scoliosis, dural ectasia, nasoethmoidal encephalocele, enophthalmos and cleft palate on radiological imaging. Results: The patient was diagnosed with Loeys Dietz syndrome type 1 as per the clinical and radiological ï¬ndings. TGFBR1 gene sequencing was performed and p. Ser241Leu(c.722 C>T) heterozygote mutation was detectedin exon 4 of the TGFBR1 gene. Mutation was not seen in the parents. Genetic counselling was provided to the family. Conclusion: Genetic diseases associated with the TGF Î² pathway are known to have similar phenotypic effects .

Indeed, heritability of bone mineral density (BMD) in twin and family studies ranges from 50 to 85%. The aim of the study was to identify known and/or novel genes and genevariants that play a role in the susceptibility of primary osteoporosis in an extended Maltese family. Materials and Methods: A 2 generation family having multiple relatives with osteoporosis (T score: < 2.5 or Z score: < 2.0) at the spine or hip were recruited. Biochemical analysis was performed to exclude other bone diseases. Whole genome sequencing was performed on 12 members and comprehensive ï¬ltering strategies were carried out on the single nucleotide variant and indel ï¬les. In silico modelling and prediction tools were used to determine potential causality of the variants. Results: Eleven shortlisted variants segregating in a dominant inheritance pattern were identi ï¬ed in the affected relatives having a minor allele frequency of â¤2%. Variantsincluded missense variants within ADAMTS20 (rs138035327), ARSD (rs78034736), BMP1 (rs368615556), CLDN18 (rs114998965), SELP (rs754086574), TGF Î²2 (rs773943154), TRIM45 (rs146244405), PCDHGA11 (rs138408376), PLEC (rs138924815) and SPARC (rs41290587), and one stopgain variant within WDR89 (rs944955056). Conclusions: Future studies will evaluate the shortlisted variants by replicating in the Malta Osteoporotic FractureStudy a case control collection of more than 1000 Maltese postmenopausal women and other extended Maltese pedigrees so as to determine association with osteoporosisand low trauma fracture risk at different anatomical sites.

They encompass over 400 disorders and most are the result of genetic defects. Pfeiffer syndrome is inheritedin an autosomal dominant pattern. It is characterized by the premature fusion of certain skull bones. This early fusion prevents the skull from growing normally and concerns theshape of the head and face. Here we are presenting a case of a 5 months old girl, with healthy parents and with a skeletal phenotype. Materials and Methods: Total genomic DNA was extracted from her salive sample and analyzed with a comprehensive skeletal dysplasias and disorders gene paneltest, that contains the most relevant genes for a skeletal phenotype. We have targeted all of the coding excons with exon intron boundaries of 186 genes using PCR basedlibrary preparation method. Sequencing reads were mapped to the reference genome (hg19) and after variant calling the variants were classi ï¬ed based on ESP, ExAc, ClinVar and HGMD information. Results: Gene panel test identi ï¬ed a likely pathogenic heterozygous mutation in the FGFR2 gene (c.940 4_945delCTAGGCCGCC) which encompass the splice site and two codons of exon 8. Currently, this mutation is notAbstracts from the 51stEuropean Society of Human Genetics Conference: â¦ 915present in the databases, but it overlaps with other mutations, which are connected to Pfeiffer syndrome. Conclusions: Multi gene panel tests could be very helpful tool in cases, when the patients phenotype overlap with different syndromes.

Hydrocephalus, a narrow foramen magnum, spinal deformity, and spinal canal stenosis can causepsychomotor delay problems, leading to disabilities in locomotion, communication, and learning. The current study presents the case of a two year old male withclinical manifestations suggestive of ACh including, relative macrocephaly, mild narrow thorax, long body, frontal blossing, ï¬atted nose, simian line on the left hand, shortness on the tips of the ï¬ngers, and shortness of rhi zome in the limbs. Hypotonicity also was presented, he could control his head control, however, he could not sit,turning back without support. He could successfully pick up and hold the objects with his thumb and index ï¬ngers. He speaks with words instead of making full sentences. Although a clinical and radiologic ACh has been con sidered since the admission, there was no cervico medullary compression or hydrocephalus, therefore sequencing analysis carried out to understand the cause of observed skeletal dysplasia due to the predominance of neurological ï¬ndings.

Andersen Tawil syndrome (LQTS7), a formof LQTS, is an autosomal dominant multisystem channe lopathy, characterized by a highly variable triad: periodicAbstracts from the 51stEuropean Society of Human Genetics Conference: â¦ 917paralysis, ventricular arrhythmias and distinctive physical features. It is incredibly rare, only more than 100 cases have been reported worldwide, about 60% caused by mutations in the gene KCNJ2 (Type 1) and the rest being unexplained (Type 2). Materials and Methods: The index patient is a 14 years old boy with LQTS, life threatening ventricular tachycardia and implanted cardioverter de ï¬brillator. Patient âs DNA was analysed by targeted NGS of 176 genes using TruSightCardio gene panel (Illumina). Variants were validated by Sanger sequencing. Results: Rare, pathogenic variant was detected in gene KCNJ2 (Potassium channel, inwardly rectifying, subfamily J, member 2) in chromosome 17: g.68171832C>T, NM_000891.2:c.652C>T, NP_000882.1:p. Arg218Trp. The KCNJ2 protein product forms a inwardly rectifying potassium channel of crucial signi ï¬cance that regulates cell excitability of cardiac and skeletal muscles. Arg218Trpsubstitution is within the C terminal domain of the protein and in heterozygous patients, as in our case, leads to loss of function and dominant negative effect as previously con cluded by functional tests.

28644,"Medipol University, Ä°stanbul, Turkey Andersen Tawil Syndrome (ATS) is a rare genetic disorder which is characterized by muscle weakness, ventriculararrhythmias and prolonged QT interval. Among clinical ï¬ndings are physical abnormalities such as low set ears, short stature, scaliolis, widely spaced eyes and neurocog nitive abnormalities such as mild learning disabilities and abstract reasoning. KCNJ2 gene mutations cause the 60 percent of ATS cases. The protein encoded by KCNJ2 gene is an integral membrane protein and inward recti ï¬er type potassium channel. This channel allows potassium to ï¬ow into a cell which participates in establishing action potentialwaveform and excitability of neuronal and muscle tissues. Mutations in the KCNJ2 gene alter the structure andfunction of potassium channels changing the regular ï¬ow of potassium ions in skeletal and cardiac muscle that can cause periodic paralysis and irregular heart rhythm.

A., Athens, Greece,4Science Labs M. S.A., Athens, Greece Introduction : We present a family in whom targeted clin ical exome sequencing supported de ï¬nitive diagnosis of a rare hereditary multisystem disorder, Andersen Tawil Syndrome (ATS). Materials and Methods: A boy and his mother were referred to the Department of Medical Genetics, Athens University. Both had similar clinical ï¬ndings with short stature, dysmorphic features and arrhythmias. Laboratorygenetic investigation involved classical karyotype analysis (negative), followed by semi targeted Exome Sequencing in the proband, using Sophia Genetics Clinical ExomeSolution (CES) and Nextera Rapid Capture Exome (Illumina), run on a NextSeq 500 (Illumina). The CES panel includes 4900 genes (114.405 exons). Data wasevaluated with two bioinformatics pipelines: SOPHiA DDM Â®(Sophia Genetics) and VarAFT 2.11 ( http://varaft. eu). Results: A known pathogenic mutation p. Arg218Trp was identi ï¬ed in the KCNJ2 gene, previously reported in ATS.918 J. del PicchiaThe variant in both the proband and his mother was conï¬rmed by Sanger sequencing (Chr 17 (GRCh37): c.652C>T, NM_000891). Discussion: The protein product of KCNJ2 , Kir2.1, belongs to a potassium channel family, expressed at high levels in heart, skeletal muscle and neural tissue. Mutationsinterfere with the function of Kir2.1 in cell excitability, and p.

Mutations in this gene are reported in one family witharrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia, familial, 13 (ARVD13) also known as dilated cadiomyopathy 13. Its main clinical features are structural and functionalabnormalities of the right ventricle with progressive ï¬bro fatty myocardial replacement and electrocardiographic changes, causing arrhythmias and sudden death. We reporthere a case of 192 Kb deletion involving the totality of exon 10 of CTNNA3 gene detected by Array based Comparative Genomic Hybridization using 180 k microarray (Agilenttechnologies, Santa clara, CA) in one year old male patient presenting a congenital pulmonary valve stenosis (PVS) with mild right ventricular dilation but without arrhythmiaor any other malformation. The patient was the result of the third conception of a healthy non consanguineous spouse. The 1st and 2ed born were a 4 and 2 year old normalfemales. PVS is one of the most common types of con genital heart disease (CHD) after cardiac septal defects. The genetic contributors to PVS are not as well de ï¬ned even if familial forms of non syndromic PVS have been reported in the literature. Only PTPN11 gene mutations were reported in 50% of cases of PVS associated with Noonan syndromebut never reported in isolated PVS.

It encodes lamins A/C necessary for functioning and structural integrity of the nucleus. The LMNA mutation carriers have a poor prognosis of life dueto rapidly progressive hearth involvement. We describe a male who developed dyspnea, weakness and abnormal heart rhythm at age of 35. During the next6 months, heart failure symptoms progressed rapidly. Negative myocardial remodeling and progressive heart failure were observed despite the biventricular resynchro nization therapy with optimal medical management, so heart transplantation was accomplished. We performed NGS using TruSight Cardiomyopathy Sequencing panel (Illumina Inc.) and identi ï¬ed LMNA variant c.565C>T(rs267607626), leading to amino acidic change p. R189W. The variant was indicated as pathoge netic in several predictor programs. The analysis of pedigrees has been conducted by the Sanger sequencing. The proband and two elder brothersinherited p.

However, there is no consensus which anomalies are predominant in DS. We investigated DS cohort focusing on congenital heartdefects and their associations with extracardiac malformations. Materials and Methods: A retrospective study enrolled patients diagnosed with DS from 2015 to 2017 at the Department of Human and Medical Genetics, Vilnius University. Data of 65 patients (58.5% males, 41.5%females) was analysed and the major congenital anomalies in infants with DS were examined. Statistical analysis was performed with SPSS Version 17.0 statistic softwarepackage. Results: Trisomy created through meiotic nondisjunction event was the most common cause (93.8%), with theunbalanced translocations and mosaic variants accounting for the remaining cases. The most common associated anomalies were CHD, 42 cases (64.6%), followed by vision disorders (13.8%) and digestive system anomalies (12.3%). The most common cardiac anomaly was patent ductus arteriosus (38.5%), followed by atrial septal defect (35.4%),atrioventricular septal defect (15.4%) and ventricular septal defect (7.7%). 14 children (21.5%) with CHD underwent cardiac surgery within the ï¬rst year of life. The other common ï¬ndings were muscle hypotonia, congenital infections and typical dysmorphic features. Conclusion: We observed a particularly high prevalence of congenital heart defects, vision disorders and digestive system anomalies. The results were similar to ï¬ndings from other studies. Thus, investigation during the neonatal periodand appropriate interventions are essential to improve quality of life and to decrease mortality rates. E. M. Blayt Ä:None. V. G. Samson Ä:None. A.

28650,"Medical Genetics Institute, Shaare Zedek Medical Center, Jerusalem, Israel Introduction: Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardio myopathy (ARVC) can lead to sudden death in otherwise healthy young individuals. ARVC is characterized byvariable expressivity even within families. 45 â50% of ARVC cases are caused by mutations in genes encoding desmosomes, intercellular junctions that anchor inter mediate ï¬laments to the plasma membrane, and have both structural and signaling functions. A broad spectrum of point mutations in DSP (desmopla kin), a desmosome component, cause ARVC8 (MIM# 607450) or other OMIM phenotypes (MIM# 605676, 615821, 609638, 612908, 607655) that include at least oneof the following: ARVC, cardiomyopathy, tooth agenesis, skin disease (keratoderma, keratosis palmoplantaris, epider molysis bullosa) or hair defects. Both autosomal recessive andautosomal dominant inheritance has been reported, so it is unclear whether loss of DSP function is the underlying defect. Materials and Methods: Chromosomal Microarray Analysis (CMA), (Affymetrix CytoScan750K array, Thermo Fisher Scienti ï¬c, Santa Clara, Ca.) was performed in an amniocentesis sample obtained because of advancedmaternal age. Results: We identi ï¬ed a 286kbp deletion, fully encom passing DSP. Family history was found to include a cardiomyopathy related death, as well as wooly hair in several relatives. The DSP deletion segregated with wooly hair in family members. Cardiovascular examination isundergoing to determine its segregation. Conclusions: This is the ï¬rst evidence for whole gene deletion of DSP causing an ARVC related disorder. Ourresults implicate haploinsuf ï¬ciency as a mechanism of DSP related diseases, and coupled with previous reports, suggest dosage sensitivity with more severe manifestationsin cases with biallelic mutations. Furthermore we recom mend CMA testing for unresolved ARVC cases. O. Freireich: None. O. Weiss: None. S. Zeligson: None. O. Lobel: None. M. Ben Uziyahu: None. E. Levy Lahad: None. R. Segel: None.

28652,"Introduction: Genetic and environmental factors are important contenders for predisposition to hypercholester olemia . High levels of low density lipoproteins(LDL C) may induce an in ï¬ammatory response and its atherogenic effects may produce signi ï¬cant quantities of reactive oxy gen species,resulting in oxidative stress. This oxidative stress alongwith prolonged medication can induce genetic damage and lipid peroxidation by oxidising thebiomolecules. Materials and Methods: To investigate the state of genetic damage and lipid peroxidation in patients withhypercholesterolemia, a case control study was carried out. Patients (n ,50; 20 40y) from local hospitals and age , sex and socioeconomic status matched healthy controls fromgeneral population (n ,50; 20 40y) formed the study group under Informed Consent after approval of the study by the Institutional Ethical Clearance Committee. Venous bloodsamples were used for serum separation and MDA levels (Malondialdehyde:by product of lipid peroxidation) were determined. DNA damage was investigated in peripheralblood leukocytes of the subjects using comet assay. Results: Statistical analyses revealed that MDA levels were signi ï¬cantly higher (p ,0.000) in patients (2.76 Â±0.16 Î¼mol/l) as compared to that in controls (1.45 Â±0.08 Î¼mol/l). A signi ï¬cant increase in damage frequency (94.75Â±4.89;p ,0.050), damage index(144.22Â±107.86;p , 0.001) and per cent DNA in tail(44.85Â±0.89;p ,0.000) were observed in patients. Correlation analysis revealed a signiï¬cant positive association of LDL C with damage index(p ,0.050) and MDA(p ,0.000)and negative asso ciation of HDL C with MDA(p ,0.001). Conclusion: High LDL C levels induces oxidative stress and genetic damage in the patients and thus requires management so as to reduce the risk for cardiovascular andhepatocellular diseases.

Environmental and genetic factors mayaccount differently in different regions of Italy. Aims Enrol 3,000 high school students in 3 regions of Italy (Lombardy, Tuscany and Apulia) in order to: determine the prevalence of HT and obesity; perform the genetic characterization of some HT candidate loci; search for new urinary markers useful for an early renal damage detection. Materials and Methods: Blood pressure (BP), anthro pometric values, a survey on dietary habits of 2960 students and their parents have been collected. Genomic DNAs, extracted from saliva (by OrageneG500, DNAGenotek),have been genotyped by OpenArray Technology (Thermo Fisher Scienti ï¬c) for Adducin and Endogenous Ouabain (ADD EO) pathway genes. Results: Regional differences both for estimated sodiuria (p<0.001) and SBP values (p<0.005) have been observed. BP in the whole sample signi ï¬cantly correlated both with BMI (p <0.0001) and sodiuria (p <0.0001). Children of hypertensive parents (34%) showed higher SBP values than their peers with negative familiarity (p ,0.019). Subjects carrying mutated variants of ADD1 and ADD2 genes showed greater excretion of urinary Na compared to wild type ones (p ,0.015). LSS gene variants associate to BP.

In this study, we tried to identify the riskprediction of hypertension by the blood pressure marker used in the DTC service based on the DTC service results. We analyzed 647 Koreans for eight blood pressure markers(NPR3, ATP2B1, NT5C2, CSK, HECTD4, GUCY1A3, CYP17A1, FGF5). We took a DNA sample with buccal swap kit and collected the customer questionnaire. Weanalyzed the results of eight blood pressure markers and age, gender, smoking, drinking, and family history of hypertension in questionnaire. Among the eight markers, NT5C2 and CYP17A1 showed association tendency with hypertension . Then, we combined the eight gene marker genotypes and calculated the genetic risk scores based onthe number of risk allele and the multiple regression effects size to the hypertension . As a result, the combined index of the genetic risk score was signi ï¬cantly associated with the questionnaire hypertension history (Odds ratio , 2.72 (95% CI : 1.52 ~ 4.86), P ,0.001).

28655,"2Medical Faculty Maribor, University Maribor, Maribor, Slovenia Introduction: Chromosomal microarray analysis has sig niï¬cantly increased the ability to diagnose medical condi tions caused by copy number variations. However mosaicism can confound the interpretation of chromosomal microarray results. We describe a case of sex chromosomesmosaic fetus with four cell lines. At the 22 thweek of pregnancy the hypoplastic left heart syndrome: presence of endocardial ï¬broelastosis of the left ventricle with aortic valve stenosis, was detected. Because of poor prognosis the pregnancy was terminated. Autopsy of the male fetus con ï¬rmed the presence of hypoplasia of the left ventricle and ascending aorta with VSD and mitral valve atresia. Materials and Methods: QF PCR test, aCGH analysis using 8x60K array and metaphase chromosome analysisafter amniocenteses were performed. Results: QF PCR result was normal. Array CGH revealed additional copy of the whole short arm ofchromosome Y in approximately 40% of cells and a loss of the whole long arm of chromosome Y: arr(Yp)x2[40], (Yq)x0. Metaphase analysis demonstrated mosaic karyo type: 45,X[82]/46,X,i(Y)(p10)[11]/47,X,i(Y)(p10), +i(Y) (p10)[7]/46,XY[2]. Conclusions: Our data demonstrate that although aCGH should be the ï¬rst tier test for clinical diagnosis of chromosome abnormalities, chromosome analysis remain valuable in the detection of mosaicism and delineation ofchromosomal structural rearrangements. Phenotype of mosaic subject is primarily dependent on the dominant cell line in a speci ï¬c tissue. Because our fetus was male we speculated that in gonads the cell lines i(Yp) and XY predominated. The high incidence of hypolastic left heart syndrome is seen in Turner syndrome girls, so the presenceof 45,X cell line in our case could explain the heart malformation. A. Zagorac: None. A.

While clinical features partly overlap, major phe notypic groups include dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM),limb girdle muscular dystrophy (LGMD), premature aging and lipodystrophy disorders. Genotype phenotype correla tions are tricky but correlations exist between a speci ï¬c LMNA variant and a distinct condition. Less is known about different phenotypes resulting from the same mutation. Materials and Methods: Four families with multiple members carrying the c.1146C>T (p. G382G) variant in LMNA (causing abnormal splicing) were identi ï¬ed. Cardi ologic and neurological assessment were performed. Result: In one family, ï¬ve individuals carrying the p. G382G variant were affected by a cardiac only phenotype with DCM and cardiac conduction defects (CCD). Neitherthe 67 year old proband had muscular involvement. In three additional families, the index cases (one male and two females) were ascertained for LGMD, with ages at onsetvarying 2nd 5th decade. Only in the male proband, LGMD was associated to DCM and arrhythmias, while the females aged >60 years, manifested LGMD and CCD. In theirfamilies a variable combination of LGMD, DCM, arrhyth mias was observed. Conclusion: We report the same p. G382G variant in LMNA associated to different phenotypes within the same and between different families. This unique variant may associate to cardiac only phenotype, or manifest withneuromuscular involvement. These observations are rele vant for genetic counseling and preventive medicine in p.

With the prevalence 1:2000 it is the most often diagnosed arrhythmogenic disorder. At least 15 LQTS related genes have been identi ï¬ed so far, nevertheless 75% of mutations are found in 3 major genes (KCNQ1 ,KCNH2 andSCN5A ). Here we report identi ï¬ca tion of likely pathogenic variants in patient previouslyinvestigated with negative results. Materials and Methods: A sequencing panel including 15 genes for LQTS was designed. Genomic DNA wasobtained from peripheral blood of LQTS patients or frozen tissue samples for molecular biopsy in cases of sudden unexplained death. Sequencing library was prepared byTruSeq Custom Amplicon kit (Illumina), sequencing was performed on MiSeq (Illumina). Variants in coding and promoter regions were extracted. Results: We identi ï¬ed 2 variants, Arg562Ser in KCNQ1 and Phe68Cys in KCNH2 , in patient where single strand polymorphism analysis (SSCP) was previously performedwith negative results. Variant Arg562Ser was previously reported as pathogenic; variant Phe68Cys has not been described yet. Using the ACMG AMP guidelines both ofthese two variants are evaluated as likely pathogenic. Conclusions: Molecular con ï¬rmation of diagnosis is important in LQTS cases. It improves the diagnosticaccuracy and risk strati ï¬cation in patients and their relatives.

Genome wide association studies have reported many common variants and risk loci that affect cardiac diseases, but they are limited to liking these variants with phenotypic consequences. The importance of geneticpredisposition to CAD and MI is best documented by the predictive value of a positive family history. The genetic causes for familial clustering of MI are less clear. Next Generation Sequencing in families with several affected individuals has revolutionized mutation identi ï¬cation in Mendelian diseases, but can also successfully be applied tomore complex phenotypes such as CAD and MI. In this study, we applied whole exome sequencing and co segregation analysis in one MI family and identi ï¬ed a heterozygous c.1324G>T alteration resulting in a substitu tion of p. V442L in exon 6 of EPHA2 , a gene located at the 1p36 locus in humans, which is associated with MI. Themissense variant, rs772857919 (p.

The same mutation was detected in anunrelated patient presenting with MI while absent in the exomes of 2,000 controls. EphA2 receptor plays important role in regulating the cellular events after permanent cor onary occlusion and its entanglement in the progression of ischemic cardiomyopathy.

Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) by bal loon angioplasty and stenting have participated in the treatment of CAD. Unfortunately, after surgical interven tion, the vascular injury often causes restenosis that can be reduced the luminal diameter of more than 50%. Vitamin D deï¬ciency is a notable risk factor for CAD. Vitamin D receptor (VDR) and vitamin D binding protein (VDBP) gene mutations which play role in vitamin D metabolism may also have role in the progression of the disease as wellas restenosis after stent implantation. Therefore, it was aimed to detect VDR and VDBP mutations and toinvestigate the relation between other risk factors which may cause restenosis. Patients and Methods: Ninety three stent implanted CAD patients were enrolled to the study. rs2228570, rs1544410 mutations in VDR ; rs4588, rs7041 mutations in VDBP were investigated by RT PCR. Other risk factors were also investigated. Results were evaluated statistically. Results: rs4588 and rs2228570 mutations were found statistically high in patients. Vitamin D de ï¬ciency was found statistically signi ï¬cant in patients. Also it was found that there is a relation between myocard infarction and rs7041 mutation. Additionally, rs2228570 mutation wasfound to be related with vitamin D de ï¬ciency. Conclusion: According to these ï¬ndings, it was con sidered that the presence of both vitamin D de ï¬ciency and gene mutations which are related with vitamin D metabo lism may increase restenosis in CAD patients.

A signi ï¬cant number of these cases remain unexplained, even after complete postmortem investigation. Abnormalities in cardiac expressed geneshave been associated with arrhythmogenic disorders, which may cause sudden cardiac death. Due to the fact that those diseases are inherited, close relatives of deceased may alsobe at risk. Abstracts from the 51stEuropean Society of Human Genetics Conference: â¦ 927Materials and Methods: Postmortem genetic analysis was performed in sudden death cases under the age of 45. DNA was extracted from blood and the samples were sequenced by means of a de ï¬ned gene panel using Next generation sequencing (NGS). The sequencing data were subjected to bioinformatics analysis and detected sequencevariants were assessed using common databases and applying in silico prediction tools. Results: In this study, several sequence variants could be identi ï¬ed in the genes analyzed. Due to the detection of numerous unknown and unclassi ï¬ed variants, the inter pretation of the results proved to be challenging. However,by means of an appropriate evaluation of the ï¬ndings, NGS may represent an essential part for the forensic investigation in unclear autopsy cases. Conclusion: Molecular autopsy is an important tool to support forensic investigation in order to clarify the cause of death and implies great progress for relatives of young SCDvictims facilitating adequate risk strati ï¬cation and genetic counselling.

This project aims to identify correlations between SUA and protein biomarkers for disease. Materials and Methods: OLINK Proseek panels were used to measure serum levels of biomarkers for in ï¬amma tion and cardiovascular disease in the CROATIA Vis and ORCADES cohorts (combined n ,1,470). 266 proteins were included in the analysis. Spearman correlations were calculated between SUA and protein biomarkers, along with 20 additional phenotypes. Measurements were corrected forkinship, age and sex. To account for confounding between phenotypes, partial correlations were calculated between SUA and each phenotype. Additionally, multiple lassoregressions were run and each phenotype scored on how often it was retained in a predictive model for SUA. Results: Signi ï¬cant partial correlations were detected between SUA and Fibroblast Growth Factor 23 (FGF23), Epithelial Cell Adhesion Molecule (EpCAM) and Insulin Like Growth Factor Binding Protein 2 (IGFBP2). Partialcorrelations were calculated for these three proteins, creating a network model of correlations that provides928 J. del Picchiacontext for their relation to uric acid. These associations have persisted in sensitivity analyses, and have also been detected using lasso regression. Replication of the results in independent cohorts is in progress. Conclusions: Uric acid correlates with multiple cardio vascular disease and in ï¬ammation biomarkers. Investiga tion into the genetic basis of these associations may help better understand the debated role of SUA in cardiovascular disorders. J. Marten: None. T. S. Boutin: None. A. Richmond: None. J.

There is some evidence that uterine NK cells regulateangiogenesis in the endometrium and therefore may also play a role for implantation and early pregnancy. NK cell density was positively correlated with the formation ofblood and lymphatic vessels, spiral arteriole smooth muscle differentiation and oedema in endometrium of women with recurrent pregnancy loss. In our study, by using real timePCR technique, we measured the expression levels for the most important angiogenic factors VEGFA and its receptor VEGFR2, as well as for chemokine SDF 1 and its receptorCXCR4, in decidua samples from spontaneous abortions compared to decidua from matched controls of elective abortions. Six endometrial samples from euploid sporadicmiscarriages and 4 samples from matched controls were investigated for mRNA levels of these angiogenic factors and chemokines. The results showed increased expressionof all studied molecules: about 3 times average increase in the expression levels of VEGFA and CXCR4, as well as higher increase in the expression of SDF 1 (by 7 times onaverage) and VEGFR2 (by 9.8 times on average). Our results suggest dysregulation of VEGFA/VEGFR2angiogenesis in the endometrium of miscarriages, along with the higher expression of CXCR4 (chemokine receptor, expressed by NK cells) and its chemokine ligand SDF 1 (most probably expressed by endothelial cells).

We are report ing a case of young patient after VF without familiar historyof sudden cardiac death (SCD) or structural heart disease, with still undescribed variant in MYLK2 gene detected by NGS. Material and Methods: Patient was 37 years old women after SCD and CPR procedure due to VF. On admission patient was stable and conscious. Blood tests and echocardiography were normal, on ECG a sinus rhythm waspresent. Coronary angiography and electrophysiologic testing were both normal, only pair of ventricular premature complexes (VPC) from septal region were observed. Sev eral polymorphic VPC triplets were present on Holter. Patient was declared idiopathic VF and an ICD was implanted. Up to now two episodes of VF and severalepisodes of polimorphic VT were treated with ICD. Results: NGS genetic testing using TruSight Cardio (Illumina) was performed, mutation NM 033118.3: c.4G>Ain MYLK2 gene was detected. Conclusion: MYLK2 gene mutations are present in some familial HCM. Since our patient presents no signs ofcardiomyopathy or structural heart disease, it is possible that clinical form of HCM will evolve later.

Deletions at 2p25.3 have been reported in several patients with obesity and intellectual disability. Myelin transcriptor factor 1 like (MYT1L) gene in this locus has been proposed a candidate gene for obesity. MYT1L is expressed in the developing brain and has been recognized as part of the leptin melanocortin SIM1pathway. Materials and Methods: We report a 13 year old boy presenting with overweight already at 1 year of age (bodymass index (BMI) Z score +2.3) and obesity at 2 years of age (BMI Z score +3.8). The patient had hyperphagia, delayed neurological, cognitive and motor development. Healso had speech delay, strabismus, hyperactivity and intellectual disability. Brain MRI was normal. The parents and sister had normal BMI. Results: Whole genome sequencing, including DNA samples for the index and his parents and sibling, identi ï¬ed in the index a novel heterozygous de novo frameshift deletion that introduces a premature termination of transla tion NM_015025.2(MYT1L): c.2215_2224delACGCCTGCC, p.(Thr739Alafs*7) inMYT1L .

The identi ï¬cation of novel monogenic forms of childhood onset obesity will provide insights to the involved geneticpathways. Further studies on MYT1L will increase our understanding of its biological function, role in appetite regulation and development of syndromic features, and mayidentify potential targets for therapy.

To date, more than 50 nuclear genes can cause nucleargene encoded Leigh syndrome. NDUFS6 encodes a 13KDa subunit of complex I, which is part of the peripheral arm and is localized in the iron sulfur fraction of the complex. Mutations in the NDUFS6 gene were previously reported in only 8 patients from 5 families and all presented with severe neonatal lactic acidemia with complex I de ï¬ciency leading to death in the ï¬rst days of life. Here, we present a patient with two novel NDUFS6 mutations to expand the clinical and biochemical spectrumof the disease. Compare to previous reports, this child had a milder phenotype compatible with a Leigh syndrome associated with multiple de ï¬ciencies of OXPHOS com plexes. Sequencing of a panel of 300 genes involved in mitochondrial disorders allowed the identi ï¬cation of two NDUFS6 pathogenic variants resulting in almost complete absence of the protein. The ï¬rst variant c.309 +5G>A results in the translation of an unstable protein missing exon 3. The second variant c.343T>C results in a substitution of acystein located in the Zn ï¬nger domain needed for correct assembly of complex I and a major assembly defect of complex I was revealed by BN PAGE.

Materials and Methods: Whole exome sequencing (WES) was performed for an adult patient with clinicallydiagnosed mitochondrial encephalopathy with progressive external ophthalmoplegia, ptosis and mitochondrial DNA deletions The proband was from a consanguineous Polish family with two affected siblings in the pedigree suggesting autosomal recessive inheritance. Results: Bioinformatics analysis showed a new variant in theRNASEH1 gene c.493G>C, p. Gly165Arg and predict the damaging potential of the variant. The RNASEH1 gene encodes a ribonuclease H1 that speciï¬cally degrades the RNA of RNA DNA hybrids and plays a key role in DNA replication and repair. Mutations inthis gene lead to progressive external ophthalmoplegia with mitochondrial DNA deletions (MIM: 616479). The family studies con ï¬rmed biallelic inheritance in two affected siblings. The homozygous variant was not observed in healthy siblings and offspring. The novel variant was not detected in 360 chromosomes from healthyPolish subjects.

These disorders usually present duringinfancy or childhood period as progressive conjugated hyperbillirubinemia and liver dysfunction, without propertreatment can lead to death at the ï¬rst decade of life. PFIC3 is caused by mutations in the ABCB4 or MDR3 gene. This protein is a phospholipid translocator involved in biliary phospholipid excretion. Phospholipids, cholesterol and bile salt form micelles that are essential for the inactivation process of bile salt toxicity and prevent epithelium injury Study group: Ten members of a Bedouin family with 3 affected children were genetically analyzed. All the patients had cholestasis. Another infant from a different family wasalso diagnosed based on genetic analysis. Genetic analysis: DNA was extracted from peripheral blood. Genotyping was done on parents and two affectedchildren using Affymetrix GeneChip Human Mapping 250K Sty arrays. Dedicated software (KinSNP) was used to search the microarray results for homozygous regionsconsistent with linkage. Homozygosity was detected for chromosome 7 that includes ABCB4, each of the 28 coding exons and their splice junctions of ABCB4 was PCRampli ï¬ed and sequenced. Results: A novel mutation c. C433T, causing Gln145Stop was identi ï¬ed in exon 6. It segregated as expected in the family showing homozygosity only in the patients. The truncation of the transporter in the cytoplasmic domain is expected to result in an inactive transporter, thus to be thecause the disease in the family. L. Aspit: None. M. Arafat: None. B.

Clinical presentation and severity of the disease depend on the common (MAF>5%) germline variants in the complement system genes, including haplotypes in the CD46 andCFH , associated with the low ( CD46 GGAAC ) or high ( CFH H3 ) risk of unfavorable disease outcome. Here we describe a family with a clinical follow up of 11 years. Among 8 siblings, three brothers were affected byaHUS at 22, 27 and 27 yoa, and their niece developed a severe disease at the age of 10 months. We employed next generation sequencing to analyze the complete sequences of13 aHUS related genes in all the 11 family members. We also analyzed risk genotypes in 412 unrelated healthy volunteers to verify their population frequency. The analysis revealed a complex genetic background and familial aggregation of the disease. The 10 month patient was heterozygous for both the MC GGAAC and CFH H3 haplotypes, while the adult patients were heterozygous for the CFH and homozygous for the MCP haplotype, suggesting its protective role. We also identi ï¬ed a potential novel risk genotype in the C3gene (AA in rs11569511), present only in the kindred patient, with a population frequency at 1.3%. The analysis also revealed a populationfrequency of the homozygous CFH H3 risk haplotype at 2.6%, underlining the complex pathogenesis of the disease.

A family with four affected members and presenting autosomal dominant inheritance, was studied to search for the putative genetic defect. Materials and Methods: All affected patients met the International Study Group criteria for BD.. Father and three sibs are affected, and three sibs were unaffected. Exomesequencing was performed in all four affected individuals. Candidate causative variant search in accordance with autosomal dominant inheritance was performed. Hetero zygous rare (MAF <0.005), exonic/splicing variants which were present only in affected individuals were prioritized. Result: Patients did not carry any rare variants in the TNFAIP3 gene, which is the only known BD related gene. Further, seven rare variants shared by the patients only were chosen as candidates. These are heterozygous c.1756C>T(p. P586S) in PRG4 (rs757882876), c.35A>T (p. D12V) in NAGK (rs150821125), c.1490C>G (p. A497G) in SLC9A2 , c.3128G>T (p. G1043V) in PIK3R4 (rs56160735), c.11T>G (p.

The aim of this study was the elaboration and implementation of a custom designed 173 genes NGS panel into routine diagnostics. We performed NGS sequencing for 49 patients with different referral diag nosis: Diamond Blackfan anemia (17); aplastic anemia(16); Fanconi anemia (3), myelodysplastic syndrome (5); bone marrow failure (3), idiopathic thrombocytopenia (3), dyskeratosis congenita (1), severe congenital neutropenia(1). Sample preparation was carried out with KAPA HTP Library Preparation Kit Illumina (Roche, Switzerland) and tagret hybridization enrichment technique via custom probepanel SeqCap EZ Choice Library (Roche, Switzerland). Obtained libraries were sequenced on MiSeq platform (Illumina, USA).We revealed 27 rare genetic variants thatcould relate to the cause of the disease (10 pathogenic, 6 likely pathogenic and 11 variants of uncertain signi ï¬cance).

It has overlapping features to Noonan syndrome such as developmental anomalies, heart defects, bleeding problems, lymphatic dysplasias and hyperextensive joints. Patients with CBL syndrome alsohave an increased risk to develop juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML) an aggressive haematopoetic malignancy of early childhood characterized by anemia, thrombocyto penia and hepato splenomegaly. Case report: A girl, born at 27 weeks, was referred for genetic evaluation at 3 weeks (corrected age) with cleftpalate, brain abnormalities, severe thrombocytopenia and splenomegaly. Dysmorphology assessment highlighted only subtle facial anomalies. 180K CGH array was normal. Clinical exome sequencing revealed de novo heterozygous point mutation p.(Gln367Pro) in the CBL gene. Because of this result, a bone marrow examination was performed and adiagnosis of JMML was made. Discussion: Fifty four cases of CBL syndrome had been described before, four of them had the p.(Gln367Pro) pointmutation. The phenotype was quite variable among these patients, usually more subtle than in the NS with heart defects being less common. Cleft palate is not a typicalfeature and could represent either an expansion of the phenotype or an occasional association. Brain malforma tions and the development of splenomegaly (and JMML aswell) are reported, respectively, in 26% and >70% of patients with the CBL syndrome (including our case), demonstrating how these two features are actually the majorones that allow one to distinguish the CBL syndrome in the RASopathies spectrum.

Ef ï¬cient and sensitive detection of clonal rear rangements of immunoglobulin (Ig) and T cell receptor (TCR) genes by NGS is applicable in most cases of acutelymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and used for MRD mon itoring along with RT PCR of fusion transcripts and ï¬ow cytometry. Materials and Methods: Our cohort consisted of pediatric ALL patients aged 4 to 13. Initial detection of patient speci ï¬c clonal rearrangements, performed on DNA samples extracted from bone marrow prior to treatment, was carried out by 8 multiplex PCRs of Ig/TCR followed by NGS. MRD detection included targeted NGS of previouslydetected rearrangements. Quantitative analysis was based on digital PCR like statistical approach. Abstracts from the 51stEuropean Society of Human Genetics Conference: â¦ 939Results: We identi ï¬ed over 500 leukemic rearrangements in 87 patients. To evaluate the accuracy of the technique we compared MRD levels of 31 follow up samples: 16 samples with RT PCR measured MRD and 15 samples measured by ï¬ow cytometry. In both series both negative and positive results were con ï¬rmed by NGS. Conclusions: MRD detection by NGS is a sensitive and speciï¬c method allowing for clonality evaluation and MRD quanti ï¬cation. Given that RT PCR of fusion genes and ï¬ow cytometry in some cases are not applicable for MRD detection, NGS based detection of Ig rearrangements is likely to become routine procedure for MRD measurement.

To date, less than 100 patientshave been described. Case report. A 5 year old girl, born preterm to healthy consanguineous Italian parents, was referred to our hospital for proportionate prenatal onsetgrowth failure (height and HC 2 SD; weight 4 SD) and mild to moderate neutropenia. Review of records and fur ther investigation highlighted: stomatitis, persistent in ï¬am mation of unknown cause (normal faecal calprotectin) but no amyloid deposition, mild global developmental delay, neonatal pulmonary hypertension, congenital heart disease(atrial septal defect, mild tricuspid insuf ï¬ciency, vascular ring), low serum HDL cholesterol, renal dysplasia with sub nephrotic proteinuria, treated bilateral inguinal hernia,effusive otitis media. Previous ï¬ndings and appearance on physical examination (prominent super ï¬cial veins, trian gular facies, unilateral congenital ptosis, epicanthus, bluishsclera, bilateral abnormal palmar creases, proximally placed thumbs, mild clitoromegaly) led to a clinical diagnosis ofG6PC3 de ï¬ciency.

The incidence of this rare disorder is approximately one to four cases per 1.000.000 live male births. Material and Methods: We report a six month old boy who had presented with pulmonary septicemia of mixed etiology, secondary thrombocytopenia, eczema and pete chial haemorrhagic rash. Immunological investigations have demonstrated essential humoral and cellular changes: low serum level of IgM (0.3mg/L) and IgA (0.2mg/L), elevatedIgE (767.6kU/L), low level of CD4( +) T cells (9%) and elevated CD8( +) T cells (59%). Genetic analysis for the detection of a mutation of WAS gene was performed bypolymerase chain reaction single strand conformational polymorphism analysis (PCR SSCP) and direct sequencing of the PCR product. The primers was taken from ArigaTadashi et.al., 1997. Results: In PCR SSCP analysis, the patient had an abnormal shift band, which was not found in normalcontrols. In direct sequencing analysis, the patient with WAS showed A to G transition at complementary nucleo tide 274 (c.274 2 A>G), located in intron 2. A review offamily history did not reveal the presence of relatives clinically diagnosed as having WAS and since DNAanalysis of the patient's mother revealed no mutation, we can assume that the mutation found in the patient must have occurred spontaneously. Conclusions: The present study identi ï¬ed a splicing mutation of the WAS gene responsible for WAS in a Moldavian family. To our knowledge, this is the ï¬rst report on the splicing mutation of WAS gene in Republic of Moldova. D. G. Turcan: None. L. Andriesh: None. O. Schitco: None. V. Hlistun: None. I. Coliban: None.

He was born at term, BW 3100 g, BL 50 cm, Apgar scores were 10/10. Cytogenetic prenatal diagnosis due to advanced maternal age was performedand revealed a normal karyotype. During early childhood developmental delay was observed. At ï¬rst visit, he was 10 years old, with severe intellectual disability, speechdevelopmental delay, mild facial dysmorphism, aggressive behavioral problems worsening with age and occasional episodes of hyperactivity. Array CGH analysis showed a de novo 9563 kb deletion in 2q31.2q32.1 between 179 to 188 Mb. The deletion involves 54 genes, including CERKL, FRZB, ZNF804A, ITG4A genes, which, according to literature, may be responsible for speci ï¬c cognitive and behavioral phenotype and craniofacial abnormalities. We have compered the speci ï¬c phenotype of our patient with patients diagnosed with 2q31.2q32.3 deletion syndrome reported in literature and we have noticed similarities. Conclusion: This case of interstitial deletion revealed by array CGH suggest that 2q31.2q32.1 could be the critical region in 2q31.2q2q32.3 deletion syndrome. The similarreports in the future will be important to de ï¬nitely de ï¬ne the critical region of this deletion syndrome. S. Huljev Frkovic: None. K. Francic: None. K. Crkvenac Gornik: None. I.

(Ser329Valfs*28) in the CNTNAP2 gene, in a boy with a clinical presentation overlapping Pitt Hopkins syndrome. This variant has not been previously reported in the litera ture; however it is predicted to disrupt normal translation of the CNTNAP2 gene. It segregated from heterozygous, consanguineous, normal parents. The patient was born fol lowing a normal pregnancy and delivery. Motor develop mental milestones âacquisition was normal but speech was delayed. Generalised, tonic clonic seizures occurred at 30 months of age and were associated with loss of babbling. At 4 years and 6 months, the patient had a severe, focalepilepsy disorder with varied seizure semiology that responded well to sodium valproate. EEG ï¬ndings were non speci ï¬c and brain MRI showed a slightly smaller, left temporal lobe without cortical dysplasia.

This condition shows phenotypic heterogeneity which probably caused by widevariability in size and localization of the deletion. 6q dele tions are classi ï¬ed according to position of the anomaly; proximal (6q11q16), medial(6q15q25) and terminal(6q25qter). To date, the medial 6q deletion was observed in approximately 30 patients. We report a patient with a medial 6q interstitial deletions. Material and Methods: The proband, a 3 year old boy, was the second child of healthy non consanguineous parents. He was referred to our clinic because ofdysmorphic features and learning dif ï¬culty. His physical examination demonstrated microcephaly, hypertelorism, epicanthus, down slanting palpebral ï¬ssure, frontal bossing, large simple ear, scoliosis. His weight and height were within normal range. Results: His cytogenetic evaluation with conventional GTG banding resulted in 46,XY. Considering the pheno typic abnormalities of the patient, array CGH analysis was performed. 10000 Kb interstitial deletion at 6q21q22.31bands, arr[hg19] 6q21q22.31(113,754,403 123,754,142)Ã1, was observed at analysis. The deleted region includes 55 OMIM genes. His parents had normal constitutionalkaryotype but array analysis not performed yet. Conclusion: The interstitial deletions of 6q characterized by heterogeneous phenotypes. Intellectual disability, micro cephaly, developmental delay and skeletal abnormalities were common among these patients. We compared the phenotype of our patient with those reported in theliterature.

The molecular analysis consisted on Comparative Genomic Hybridization array (aCGH) (Agilent 60K), Multiplex Ligation Dependent Probe Ampli ï¬cation (MLPA) self customized to analyze the CNV âs inheritance in parents and siblings and Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization (FISH) using the BAC clone RP11 359O20 to characterizethe CNV. Results: aCGH analysis of the patient revealed an interstitial deletion on Xp22.3 involving the Xp22.3 region. The deletion encompasses approximately 1.6 Mb (arr[hg19] Xp22.31(6,488,721 8,097,511)x0) and contained HDHD1, STS, VCX, PNPLA4 and MIR651 genes. MLPA analysis conï¬rmed the deletion in the proband, reported a duplica tion in his sister and grand mother and a normal MLPA dosage was shown in his mother and his maternal uncle. The grandfather has icthyosis too but he did not accept genetic testing. In order to decipher the normal MLPA result in the mother we applied FISH that shows amicroduplication in one X chromosome and a microdeletion in the other one. Conclusions: The deletion on Xp22.3 gene is consistent with the principal feature of our patient of X linked ichthyosis and probably for the ASD.

Heunderwent metopic craniosynostosis surgery. He does not speak. Based on clinical presentation, Floating Harborsyndrome (FHS) was suspected. FHS and Rubinstein Taybi syndrome (RTS) are both rare genetic disorders characterized by multiple congenital anomalies and intel lectual de ï¬cit. They share clinical features since causative genes belong to the same signaling pathway. FHS is caused by mutations in the SRCAP that codes for a protein who activates CREBBP .CREBBP plays a key role in regulation of cell growth and division and is crucial for normal development. Pathogenic variants in CREBBP represent a known cause for RTS. Materials and Methods: DNA was isolated from peripheral blood lymphocytes using salting out method. Clinical exome sequencing (Illumina TruSight One) which targeted genes related to observed clinical presentation was performed. Results: Clinical exome sequencing indicated presence of a novel, likely pathogenic, stopgain variant c.6244C>T (NM_004380.2) in CREBBP . Variant is present in mosaic state (18,5%). Conclusion: Presented boy is the ï¬rst reported patient with the mosaic variant c.6244C>T in CREBBP . While mosaic CREBBP variants have been described as a cause of clinical presentation with traits associated with Rubinstein Taybi syndrome, as far as we are aware, a clinical overlapbetween RTS and FHS has not been previously reported.

Hereditary cerebellar ataxias, characterized by clinically variable gait disturbances, are often accompaniedby neurological symptoms. The infantile onsets, common in patients with congenital variants, typically have developmental delay. Material and Methods: Herein, we reported a 10 years old boy who walked at the age of 6, talked at 7, born to non consanguineous parents. His clinical evaluation showedsevere motor, speech and cognitive delays, facial dysmorph isms with epicanthal folds, palpebral ï¬ssure, hypertelorism, broad nose, bulbous nasal tip, long philtrum, thin upper lip,high arched palate, irregular teeth, retrognatia, and short stature. Chromosomal Microarray Analysis (CMA) was done using GeneChip Â®CytoScanHDTM array. Results: CMA revealed a 12.9 Mb duplication in arr [GRCh37] 11q12.1q13.3(56,928,391 69,867,039)x3, encompassing 408 genes. The genes related to thephenotype were CLP1, CNTF, STX3, TMEM138, TMEM216, BEST1, UQCC3, ATL3, COX8A, SCYL1, NRXN2, SNX15, SLC25A45, RNASEH2C, AP5B1, PACS1,KLC2, BBS1, SPTBN2, NDUFV1 , and NDUFS8 . There is evidence that autosomal recessive spinocerebellar ataxia 21946 J. del Picchia(OMIM616719) is caused by compound heterozygous mutation in the SCYL1 gene. Furthermore, mutation in SPTBN2 gene cause spinocerebellar ataxia autosomal recessive 14 (OMIM615386). In both, are observed patients with developmental delay. Conclusions: The CMA is a powerful tool to investigate children with motor and developmental delays, in order to clinically relevant genetic diagnosis, such as the genetic evidence found for our proband. Therefore, CMA wasefï¬cient to help in delineating phenotypic variation and allowed adequate clinical management and better follow up for the proband and his family. I. P. Pinto: None. L. B.

Other features, present in morethan half of the individuals, were speech disorder and strabismus. Dysmorphic features were insigni ï¬cant, except for a long face. Herein, we describe two maternal half brothers with ID/ GDD in whom a hemizygous variant, c.668G>A, p.

The older brother (14 years old) has severe ID, along with mild autism spectrum disorder (ASD), microcephaly, strabismus, atrial septal defect and dysmorphic features including a long face, downslanting palpebral ï¬ssures, bilateral epicantus, long and pear shaped nose, thin upper lip and retrognathia. The younger brother (6 years old) has moderate GDD with severe language impairment, severe ASD, astigmatism andless marked dysmorphic features (a similar nose and retrognathia). The variant, classi ï¬ed as of uncertain signiï¬cance (class 3), is absent in the grandfather and present at a very low frequency in population databases and is located in a highly conserved residue of the MID2 protein.

Identi ï¬cation of microdeletion/micro duplication syndromes with DD/ID is currently performedby Multiplex Ligation dependent Probe Ampli ï¬cation (MLPA) analysis. The aim of this study was to detect the submicroscopic chromosomal aberrations using MLPA inchildren with GDD/ID. Materials and Methods: At the Laboratory for Medical Genetics Tirgu Mures, Romania we investigated a total of56 GDD/ID children with/without congenital anomalies who had normal results of G banding karyotype analysis, using MLPA kits for common microdeletions/microdupli cations syndromes and X chromosome. Results: The detection rate for submicroscopic chromo somal aberrations was found to be 12.5%. The microdele tions/microduplications detected include regions for DiGeorge syndrome (3 cases), Williams syndrome (1 case), Wolf Hirschhorn syndrome (1 case), Cri du Chat syndrome(1 case) and Miller Dieker syndrome (1 case). Conclusions: Therefore, the MLPA is a cost effective analysis for identi ï¬cation of submicroscopic chromosomal aberration syndromes, enables a rapid diagnosis of genomic imbalances in patients with GDD/ID with/without con genital anomalies, and the results needed to be con ï¬rmed using other types of molecular analysis.

Postnatal growth was within the normal range. She presented withmarked psychomotor delay, expressive language disorder and hand ï¬apping. She attends a regular school with major support and speech therapy. Her clinical phenotype includesbroad nose, large mouth with thick lips, large ears, brachydactyly with tapering ï¬ngers, and deep palmar creases.

Deletion 1 spans 248 kb (arr [GRCh37] 2p16.3(50373077_50621548)x1) and deletion 2 spans 208 kb (arr[GRCh37] 2p16.3 (51054671_51263065)x1). Segregation analysis revealedcompound heterozygosity as each deletion was inherited from one parent, respectively. Discussion: To our knowledge this is only the second published case of PTHLS2 with compound heterozygosity for two intragenic NRXN1 deletions detected by micro array. Harrison et al. described a similar case of two sisterswho presented with severe epileptic encephalopathy (Harrison et al., Am J Med Genet 2011). Our case broadens the clinical and molecular spectrum of PTHLS2 butretrospectively also shows that a clinical diagnosis of PTHLS2 would not have been possible as speci ï¬c symptoms or dysmorphic features are missing.

Here we repot a patient with severe developmental delay, neurological and endocrinological abnormalities associated with a novel pathogenic variant in PURA identi ï¬ed by whole exome sequencing (WES) analysis. The patient was a 9 year old boy. The boy was born at 39 weeks of gestation as the ï¬rst950 J. del Picchiachild of nonconsanguineous healthy parents. His birth weight and Apgar score was 2210 g and 8/9, respectively. The boy showed nystagmus from infancy with delayed myelination in the brain. He was suspected to Pelizaeus Merzbacger syndrome at 7 months of age, which was excluded. He presented with severe developmental delay,intellectual impairment with no meaningful words, short stature, empty sella and pseudobulbar palsy. Written informed consent was obtained from his parents. WESanalysis was performed using Human All Exon V6 kit (Agilent) and Hiseq 2500 (Illumina). The detected variants were con ï¬rmed using Sanger sequencing. A novel hetero zygous 8 bp insertion in the PURA gene was found in the patient. The variant was de novo and it causes frameshift and premature stop codon. The variant is at the N terminalPUR repeat region I related to severe developmental delay. PURA is one of the primary responsible genes for 5q31.3 microdeletion syndrome. Thirty two patients with neuro developmental disorder and brain abnormality caused by de novo variants in PURA have been reported.

28713,"2Genome Institute of Singapore, Singapore, Singapore Background: PURA syndrome is a recently described neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by moderate to severe intellectual disability, epilepsy, feeding dif ï¬culties, hypersomnolence and hypotonia. To date, genotype phenotype correlation has been observed to have no sig niï¬cant differences between mutation classes and disease severity. Case presentation: We report a 15 years old Chinese female, who is the only child of non consanguineous parents. Antenatal and birth history were unremarkable. Asa neonate, she required tube feeding for somnolence and poor suck and also had apnea and desaturation episodes without need for intubation. She had global developmentaldelay. She walked independently at 3 years old. She had seizure like movements at 5 years old with a normal EEG. However, she developed tonic seizures with an abnormalEEG at 12 years old, in which sodium valproate had been advised. When she was ï¬rst seen in the Genetics clinic at 12years 10 months old, she remained non verbal with no stereotypic hand movements and had regression in gross motor skills since the onset of seizures. She has short stature ( 2.8 SD), moderate scoliosis, myopathic facies and no obvious facial dysmorphism. FISH for Prader Willi syndrome, chromosomal micro array analysis (CMA) and urine glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) were normal. Whole exome sequencing (WES) performed subsequently detected a novel, de novo hetero zygous c.154dupG (p. L54fs*) variant in PURA gene, consistent with the diagnosis. Conclusion: Even though a novel variant has been detected, our patient âs phenotype is consistent with the core features of PURA syndrome. Further studies are needed to better understand genotype phenotype correlation asso ciated with PURA syndrome. J. Lim: None. H. Law: None. R. Foo: None. C. Chow: None. S. Jamuar: None. E",2018

Physical examination: Spelling a few words, short stature, obesity, hypotonia, mild spasticity of lowerextremities, friendly attitude, forward leaning posture, and ataxic gait. Facial features: Bitemporal narrowing, hypoplastic suborbital ridges, strabismus, bilateral epicanthus, bullous nasal tip, strabismus, downturned mouth, deep ï¬ltrum, and maxillar hypoplasia. Brain MRI showed bilateral dysmye linating areas adjacent to the posterior horn of lateral ventricles. MR spectroscopy or routine metabolic screening detected no abnormality. EEG: Focal paroxysmal activity in right parietooccipital location. Materials and Methods: Sequence analysis was per formed on DNA from the peripheral blood sample using TruSight One sequencing panel (4813 genes). Results: Sequence analysis revealed c.434G>A variant causing a non conservative Arg145Gln alteration in amino acid sequence, classi ï¬ed as Variant of Unknown Signi ï¬ cance (VUS).

He is the ï¬rst child born to non consanguineous healthy parents. Following an uncompli cated pregnancy, the newborn was delivered at 41 weekswith normal head circumference of 36.5 cm. There was perinatal acidosis. First words were spoken around 15 months of life, walking without help was at the age of18 months, and he has been clean since the age of three. IQ value at four years was about 73. Other observed features were epicanthus of eyelids on both sides, discrete stra bismus, short ï¬ngers, and a shawl scrotum. Fragile X syn drome was ruled out at the age of four years. Cytogenetic analysis revealed a male karyotype with a pericentricinversion of chromosome 5 [46,XY,inv(5)(p15.2q31.1) mat]. Microarray CGH analysis was initiated to further characterize the rearrangement and check for imbalances atthe inversion breakpoints.

Severe atopic dermatitis was obvious. As an infant he hadAbstracts from the 51stEuropean Society of Human Genetics Conference: â¦ 953hypotonia and large fontanels. Standard karyotype was normal, 46, XY and molecular analysis for Prader Willi syndrome was negative. We applied Whole Exome Sequencing (WES) which analyses 214.405 exons dis persed throughout the genome. Results: A hemizygous pathogenic deletion of 14 nucleotides UBE2A:c.421_434del14 was indenti ï¬ed in exon 6 of the UBE2A gene by WES analysis. The variant has been con ï¬rmed by Sanger sequencing. This deletion causes a frameshift predicted to result in a premature stop codon . This variant was novel but due to its truncating nature it is classi ï¬ed as a pathogenic. Parental DNA analysis of the same variant proved the de novo origin. Conclusion: We identi ï¬ed a novel mutation associated with X linked syndromic mental retardation, Nascimento type.

It is characterized by global developmental delay, hypotonia, behavioral, sleep and feeding problems, eye abnormalities, constipation and seizures. Facial features can be mildly dysmorphic but are nonspeci ï¬c. In total, 18 patients have been reported. We describe an 18 year old boy who has been examined since preschool age because of hypotonia, speech disorder and strabism. His facial pheno type was not remarkable, but with advancing age features such as broad, prominent forehead, bushy eyebrows, deep set eyes, depressed nasal bridge, bulbous nasal tip, low setposteriorly rotated ears, wide mouth with thin upper lip and broad chin became more pronounced. He had abnormalities of extremities, abnormal CNS MRI ï¬ndings and recurrent respiratory infections. He suffered from underweight affecting fat and muscular components, and showed anxietyand autistic traits. Previous specialized investigations failed to explain the etiology of his affection. Exome sequencing revealed a de novo heterozygous WAC frameshift variant NM_016628.4:c.383del, p.(Pro128Leufs*64) which was absent from all databases. All other patients with WAC mutations also carried truncating variants spread across thegene. The long follow up of our patient allowed delineating of the WAC related phenotype and its developmental tra jectory. The facial phenotype was consistent with previouscases, but we show that the main features become more pronounced with age. Nevertheless, the guidance from phenotype is rather limited and it is likely that additionalcases of this syndrome will continue to be identi ï¬ed via the genotype ï¬rst approach.

The implication of ZMYND11 , a gene located within this region, in the phenotype (essentially character ized by developmental and motor delay, craniofacial dys morphism and hypotonia) was also hypothesized. Patient and methods: We present the case of a 8 month male referred to our consult ation due to developmental delay and facial dysmorphisms. He was the second childof a non consanguineous couple born after an uneventful pregnancy with a normal pe rinatal period. His elder brother presents autism without speci ï¬c phenotypical features. At 8 months, he presented hypotonia, growth failure, bilateral cryptorchidism and hypospadias. Neurophysiological studies and biochemical analyses showed normal results. Nowadays (6y), as major features, he has no verbal language and presents a peculiar facial phenotype with hypertelorism and narrow palpebral ï¬ssures, low set ears, prominent crus and auricular pit, among others. Informed consent was obtained from his parents for subsequent studies: conventional karyotype, aCGH, Prader Willi Syndrome associated defects and exome variants werestudied. Results: Karyotype and aCGH analysis revealed no alterations. Prader Willi Syndrome was discarded (neithermethylation nor CNV alterations were found at 15q11 region).Exome analysis revealed the presence of a previously described pathogenic variant on ZMYND11 gene [c.1798T>C (p.

28725,"Medical Center, Be'er Ya'akov, Israel Chromosomal microarray (CMA) is nowadays recognized as essential in the evaluation of autism and developmentaldelay. CMA interpretation depends on databases as ClinGen, DECIPHER and others, which lack information, and original papers are still essential in deciphering thesigniï¬cance of microdeletions/microduplications. We pre sent an 8.5 years old boy, with intractable epilepsy, autistic spectrum disorder (ASD), hypotonia during infancy, stra bismus and behavioral problems. Multiple EEG examina tions revealed frequent generalized interictal and ictal slow spike & wave discharges. He has various seizure types, andis treated with a combination of valproic acid, clobazam and ethusuximide with a relative improvement but partial con trol. The child exhibited behavioral problems includingaggression and violence, with recurrent rage attacks. Levetiractam administration escalated the frequency of these behaviors signi ï¬cantly, and therefore was dis continued. Metabolic workup was normal including: lactic, ammonia, blood amino acids, Carnitine, Acylcarnitine. A chromosomal microarray performed demonstrated a dele tion on chromosome 6: arr[hg19]6q22.1(117,431,000 118,040,939)x1. This 609kb deletion including the NUS1 gene is located within the minimal essential critical regionon chromosome 6q22. The region is known for autism, seizures, tremor and mild dysmorphic features, but less known for behavioural problems as in the case presented. The databases mentioned had only scarce information on the microdeletion, and we found only one paper interpreting it. This work further delineates this rare genetic disorder. We suggest that behavioral problems are part of this microdeletion, and suggest caution using Levetiractam in these patients. We emphasize the importance of earlygenetic evaluation in children with ASD and epilepsy. E. Banne: None. S. Josefsberg: None. J. Rosensaft: None. H. Bassan: None. E",2018

The manifestations of the disorder occur primarily in the adrenal cortex, the myelin of the central nervous system, and the Leydig cells of the testes. Adrenoleukodystrophy iscaused by mutations in the ABCD1 gene (MIM* 300371) located on the Xq28. ABCD1 codes a peroxisomal mem brane transporter protein (ALDP), member of the ATP binding cassette (ABC) transporter superfamily. Here we report three patients with clinical diagnosis of X linked adrenoleukodystrophy were referred for ABCD1 analysis. In two of them Sanger sequencing showed the presence of a molecular genetic variant in the ABCD1 gene thereby conï¬rming the clinical diagnosis. In the ï¬rst patient an already reported missense mutation was found c.1552C>T, p. Arg518Trp, and in the second a novel still unpublished variant c.2002A>G, p. Thr668Ala. Multipleprediction software tools (PolyPhen 2; MutationTaster; SIFT) de ï¬ne p. Thr668Ala as deleterious. Furthermore, it was not recorded in the population genetic variation data base dbSNP v138 and was not found in 60 000 control subjects in the ExAC project af ï¬rming the probable disease causing character of p.

We aimed to investigatethe association between polymorphisms in cholesterol related genes and AD in a cohort of Turkish patients. Therefore we have selected APOA5 _(rs662799), APOC1 _ (rs11568822), APOD _(rs1568565), CH25H _(rs13500), LDLR _(rs5930) and SORL1_(rs2282649) gene poly morphisms that have been previously showed signi ï¬cant association with AD risk. Materials Methods: The study group consisted of 257 AD patients (mean age: 75.9 Â± 10.4) and 414 healthycontrols (mean age: 62.2 Â± 13.1). Genotyping was performed by real time polymerase chain reaction using hydrolysis probes in Light Cycler 480. Genotypes betweengroups were compared by Pearson x2 test and multivariate regression analysis was performed to analyse the accumula tion effect of APOE Îµ4 allele. Results: Our results showed that the âTTâgenotype of CH25H _rs13500 polymorphism was signi ï¬cantly more frequent in AD group (p ,<0.001) and individuals carrying CH25H âTâallele per se, had increased risk for AD (OR,3.27, 95%CI ,2.0 5.35, p ,<0.001). The âins/ins â genotype of APOC1 _rs11568822 was signi ï¬cantly more frequent in AD group compared to controls (p ,<0.001). However no signi ï¬cant association with AD risk was found inAPOC1 insertion allele carriers that did not harbor APOE Îµ4 allele. Conclusions: Our results suggest that CH25H _rs13500 polymorphism is associated with AD risk in the Turkishpopulation and CH25H might have a role in pathogenesis of AD independent of APOE . Association between APOC 1 âinsâallele and AD risk can be explained by linkage disequilibrium with the APOE locus. G. Guven: None. E. Vurgun: None. B. Bilgic: None. H. Hanagasi: None. H.

Andermann syndrome is caused by mutations in the SLC12A6 gene [OMIM:*604878]. Here we report a male infant from Roma origin at the age of8 months. The clinical symptoms include muscle hypotonia, areï¬exia and agenesis of corpus callosum on brain ultra sound. Furthermore, the patient has developmental delay,with the greatest impairment found in his motor functions. Interestingly, he presented clinically like spinal muscular atrophy plus syndrome. Based on a previously exercisedSMA genetic test with a negative result, Sanger sequencing of the SLC12A6 gene was performed. A novel homozygous deletion was found c.2604delT, p.(Asp868GlufsTer11)clarifying the patient âs case as Andermann syndrome. The variant has not previously been reported in patients with similar clinical manifestations. Segregation analysis in thefamily showed the same variant in heterozygous state in the patient âs parents, sister and brother. Based on the variant type which implies a functionally inferior protein productthe variant is probably pathogenic. In conclusion, we pre sent the ï¬rst clinically diagnosed and genetically veri ï¬ed patient with Andermann syndrome in Bulgaria so far.

In our study we evaluated the association of Factor XIII poly morphism and the risk of Aneurysmal subarachnoid hae morrhage (aSAH) in a South Indian population. Methods: The study was performed in 200 subjects with aSAH and 205 healthy control subjects. Five ml bloodsamples were collected from subjects and DNA isolated were used for genotyping of rs5985 (Val34Leu) poly morphism of Factor XIII with Taqman Â®allelic discrimina tion assay. Statistical software R.3.0.11 was used to analyse the data and Pvalue <0.05 was considered as statistically signiï¬cant. Results: In our study, Factor XIII Val/Leu variant genotype frequency was higher in control subjects (18%) compared to aSAH patients (9%). Val34Leu variant showedsigniï¬cant difference in genotypes ( Ï 2,5.81 ; df ,2;P, 0.04) and allele frequencies ( Ï2,4.12 ; df ,1;P,0.04) between cases and controls. Val/Leu genotype (OR ,0.48, 95%CI,0.26 0.88, P ,0.02) and Leu allele was signi ï¬ cantly associated with low risk of aSAH (OR ,0.55, 95% CI,0.32 0.95, P ,0.03). Signi ï¬cant association of geno types was observed in dominant model (OR ,0.50,95% CI,0.28 0.90, P ,0.02). In subtyping, we found Leu/Leu genotype was associated with Basilar top aneurysm(OR,3.59, 95%CI ,1.1111.64, P,0.03).

The etiology of ASD is complex including genetic, epigenetic and environmental factors. 2q13 dupli cation have been associated with developmental delay, intellectual disability, ASD and dysmorphism. Several previous studies have linked the NPHP1 gene, located inthis genomic region, to ASD. In this paper we report a new case of 2q13 duplication in association with ASD and intellectual disability. The patient is a 5 years old boy bornat term from health, non consanguineous parents who was referred to the department of Child Psychiatry for speech delay and behavioral problems. Clinical evaluation revealeddysmorphic features (high forehead, large protruding ears, open held mouth), severe speech delay (he says only 6 simple words), moderate intellectual disability, autisticbehavior (no visual contact, dif ï¬cult social interaction, stereotypic movements). The genomic pro ï¬le obtained by array CGH (Agilent platforms) unveiled a 645 Kb dupli cation at 2q13 (110457697 111103309, hg18) encompass ingRGPD6 ,MALL andNPHP1 genes. To date, 11 cases with 2q13 microduplication, including NPHP1 andMALL genes, have been reported. All patients presented behavior problems including ASD, attention de ï¬cit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), obsessive compulsive disorder. Intellec tual disability was also noted in 8 patients.

An important role in etio pathogenesis of ASD is given to metabolic disorders, in particular, to the disorder of metabolism of vitamin D sys tem, which plays one of the leading roles in maintaining the epigenetic health of the organism. Purpose: To study the state of vitamin D metabolism in children with ASD for the development of the examination and treatment algorithms. Results: We examined 130 children: 86 with ASD and 44 neurotypical. The polymorphism Bsml of the VDR gene was studied: bb (pathological homozygote) 13 (15.20%)and 0 (0%), respectively, Bb 43 (50.00%) and 26 (59.09%), BB 29 (33.72%) and 18 (40.90%). 95% of children with ASD showed a decrease of 25 OH D level inthe blood, whereas in the control group in only 9% cases. Polymorphic variants of the genes methylation cycle were studied: an increase in the frequency of MTHFR 677 C/Tpolymorphisms (47.67% and 36.36%, respectively), MTHFR 677 T/T (9.30% and 6.82%), MTRR 66 G/G (31.40% and 25.00%), MTR 2756 A/G (44.19% and34.09%).

Materials and Methods: We examined a 6 years old male patient with a mild dysmorphic features: short palpebral ï¬ssures, long eyelashes, large ears with ï¬eshy lobe and outward turned helix, hyperlaxity of joints. The boy is only child of non consanguineous healthy parents with no history of congenital anomalies or developmentaldelay. The boy was born with uses of vacuum extraction after 41 weeks of an uneventful pregnancy. At birth, he presented macrosomia (4230g/57cm, head circumference37cm), bilateral postaxial polydactyly and stridor. Devel opmental delay presented from early stages, later he demonstrated poor speech. He was diagnosed autism spectrum disorder at the age of 3 years. At the age of 5 years he demonstrated subclinical epileptiform activity on EEG. Results : Chromosomal microarray analysis using Affy metrix Cytoscan 750k array revealed a 6 Mb microdeletion960 J. del Picchiaat 4q24 region (arr[hg19] 4q24(101574821_107631432) x1). Due to bioinformatics assay deletion was classi ï¬ed as variant of unknown signi ï¬cance. However, deletions comprising the region 4q24 have recently been described among individuals with an overlapping phenotype. The CXXC4 gene located in deleted region might be a candidategene for postaxial polydactyly, as it inhibits the Wnt signaling pathway and subsequently transcription of GLI3 gene, which is associated with polydactyly. Conclusions: We assume that the 4q24 locus is associated with a combination of polydactyly and mental retardation. Finding candidate genes associated withcognitive impairment is a potential target for further investigation. O. Novoselova: None. E",2018

Latest studies hypothesize possible role of CAGrepeats of ATXN1 andATXN2 gene in phenotypic expres sion of C9ORF72 expansion carriers. Materials and Methods: A large cohort of Serbian patients diagnosed as ALS (311), FTD (276), AD (170), HD like (145) was analyzed to determine the number of C9ORF72 repeats using standard PCR ampli ï¬cation with oneï¬uorescently labeled primer followed by fragment analysis on capillary electrophoresis. Repeat primed PCR was performed for apparently normal homozygous samples. In addition, all C9ORF72 expansion carriers were screened to estimate the number of CAG repeat length in ATXN1 and ATXN2 using one ï¬uorescently labeled primer and sized by capillary electrophoresis. Results: The presence of hexanucleotide repeats was detected in 12 ALS (3,86%), 5 FTD (1,81%) and 1 HD like(0,7%) patients. One (0,59%) AD patient had borderline repeats number. In majority of C9ORF72 expansion carriers ATXN1 and ATXN2 repeat length was normal. The most frequent ATXN1 allele was with 29 repeats and the most frequent ATXN2 allele was with 22 repeats. Intermediaterepeat length allele of ATXN1 (35 repeats) was detected in only one ALS patient. Intermediate repeat length of ATXN2 (27 and 28 repeats) was detected in 2 ALS patients.

Affected children present from theï¬rst year of life prolonged febrile and non febrile, gen eralized, clonic or hemiclonic epileptic seizures. 85 90% of Dravet syndrome cases are due to a mutation or deletion intheSCN1A gene. This disorder can be autosomal dominant inherited but most are due to de novo mutations. Moderate to severe cognitive impairment and intractable epilepsy iscommon. Diagnosis is based on clinical and electro encephalographic (EEG) ï¬ndings. The most common cause of death is status epilepticus. Materials and Methods : We present a boy aged 12 years and 7 months diagnosed from the ï¬rst year of life with Dravet syndrome. The patient âs clinical work up included neurologic, functional and imagistic assessment (brain MRI, electroencephalogram). SCN1A gene sequencing was performed. Results : Our patient has often been hospitalized for severe recurrent febrile seizures, some accompanied by apnea requiring orotracheal intubation and assisted ventila tion. The patient presents daily partial seizures under antiepileptic treatment and tonic clonic febrile generalized seizures during upper tract respiratory simple infections. Heshows developmental regression (moderate cognitive impairment, lack of coordination, hyperactivity, dif ï¬culty in relating to others), restless sleep and requires constantcare from his mother. The electroencephalogram showed abnormal activity. SCN1A sequencing revealed c.4970_4971insATCG, p. Thr1658SerfsX14, a not yetreported small insertion. Conclusions: This is a typical case of Dravet syndrome with dif ï¬cult seizure management. The condition severely impacts the patient âs and family âs quality of life and the long term prognosis is poor. T. Marcovici: None. M. Puiu: None. C. Bacos: None. I. Jurca Simina: None. O.

Despite evidence for the participation of genetic factors, the geneticbasis of epilepsy remains largely unknown. Here we are presenting a case of a 8 year old girl, with healthy parents and with epilepsy and mental retardation. Dravet syndromewas rule out before our examination. Materials and Methods: Total genomic DNA was extracted from her blood sample and ï¬rst analyzed with a comprehensive epilepsy gene panel test, which contains 200 most relevant genes for epilepsy. Capture based library preparation (GeneSG) was used. Second, exome sequencingwas performed using Agilent SureSelect V5 kit coupled with Illumina HiSeq sequencing. Sequencing reads were mapped to the reference genome (hg38) and after variantcalling the variants were classi ï¬ed based on ESP, ExAc, ClinVar and HGMD information. Results: Gene panel test identi ï¬ed a heterozygous variant with uncertain signi ï¬cance in the AMT gene (c.893C>T) suggesting a possible diagnosis of glycine encephalopathy, but clinical tests became negative. Exome sequencing revealed a heterozygous likely pathogenic premature stop codon in GAL gene (c.7C>T). GAL gene is linked tofamilial temporal lobe epilepsy (AD). The minor allele frequency of the T allele is 0.00006 in ExAC. Family analysis discovered that, the healthy father is a carrier of thismutation.

The majority of IEMs are caused by defective enzymes, which often results in accumulation of toxic upstream substances leading to problems. IEMs are considered as rare diseases occurring in less than 1/100.000 live births and presenting during early childhood. The true incidence is thought to be much higher because of under recognition ofclinical manifestations, especially as symptoms can be quite aspeci ï¬c and diverse. It is hypothesized that patients with psychotic disorders can be present in the under diagnosedgroup of IEMs. It is important to recognize the (neuro) psychiatric presentations of IEMs, since some IEMs are easily treatable and since treatment is more ef ï¬cacious at early stages of psychiatric manifestations, before irrever sible neurological damage occurs. Unfortunately, diagnosis is often missed or delayed resulting in poorer prognosis. The objective of this study is to investigate the diagnostic yield of a NGS based gene panel for neurodegenerative metabolic disorders into a clinical psychiatric setting.

The ââmolar tooth sign âat the neuroradiological imaging, hypotonia and developmental delay are essential features for diagnosis of this disease. Up till now, 34 different genes have been identi ï¬ed and most of these demonstrate autosomal reces sive pattern. Here, two mutations on CEP290 gene, one of which we ï¬rstly reporting in literature, are presented. Material Methods: 7 months old female patient admitted to our clinic with developmental delay and upward motion of eyes. She was second child of an unrelated parents. She was born at the 43th weeks of gestation with vaginaldelivery and she showed no complication postnatally. At the physical examination wide prominent forehead, rotatory nystagmus, left upper eyelid ptosis, hypertelorism, ante verted nares, wide philtrum and inverted nipples observed. Fundoscopy revealed hypopigmented regions at the retina. Cranial MRI showed âmolar tooth sign â, characterized by dysplastic appearance of vermis and cerebellar hemispheres. Results: Karyotype analysis was 46,XX. Next generation sequence analysis of CEP290(NM_025114) gene showedmutations of c.5493delA and c.5975_5976delGA. The variant of c.5493delA was previously reported as patho genic at ClinVar and HGMD databases, whereasc.5975_5976delGA variant was not reported at neither of these databases. Because of frameshift nature of this deletion and patient âs consistent phenotype with Joubert syndrome, we assume this variation to be pathogenic.

MS isa complex neurological disease whose prognosis depends on various factors such as disease onset age, gender, type ofneurological dysfunction, etc. LEPR gene variant rs1137101 (c.668A>G, p. Gln223Arg) alters receptor bind ing activity. In this study, we aimed to investigate the association of LEPR rs1137101 gene variant with clinical parameters of MS. Materials and Methods: The study included 475 patients with relapsing remitting (RR) MS: female to male ratio,1,6, age(meanÂ±SD) ,38,1Â±10,4 years, disease onset age(meanÂ±SD) ,30,8Â±9,0 years, EDSS(meanÂ±SD) ,3,1 Â±1,8, MSSS(meanÂ±SD) ,4,8Â±2,4. Genotyping was per formed using TaqMan Â®technology. Statistical analysis was done using SPSS software (SPSS 17.0). Results: We found a signi ï¬cantly different distribution of rs1137101 genotypes by recessive model, GG vs. AA +AG, according to MS onset age cutoff of 30 years (MS onset ageâ¤30: AA +AG,75,6% and GG ,24,4%, MS onset age Ë30: AA+AG,84,9% and GG ,15,1%; Fisher's exact test p , 0,015). Carriers of A allele had a more frequent MSoccurrence after the age of 30, in comparison to GG genotype carriers, and this association remained signi ï¬cant after the adjustment for gender (adjusted OR ,1,82, Â±95% CI,1,13 2,91, p ,0,013).

The detected variant was con ï¬rmed by Sanger sequencing. c.5560 2A>C is not recorded in the database dbSNP and was not presentamong 60000 controls subjects of the ExAC project. The detected variant is predicted to result in an in frame deletion of exon 38 of the MYH7 transcript. A variant with similareffect was identi ï¬ed in patients with MYH7 related myo pathies. Segregation analysis of the family showed the same variants in the patient âs sister and her two children (who do not have clinical presentation at the moment). The mother of the patient with a congenital heart defect is not a carrier of the detected variant. In conclusion, we present a novelsplice acceptor variant which can lead to skipping of exon 38 of the MYH7 gene.

PINK1 localises to the mitochon dria, recruiting and phosphorylating Parkin leading tomitophagy of damaged mitochondria. Mutations in PINK1 abolish such effect, increasing the vulnerability of cells to oxidative stress. Methods: High throughput sequencing (HTS) of PD related genes identi ï¬ed an extremely rare mutation, c. G139C:p. G47R in exon 1 of PINK1 . The Maltese Geoparkinson collection (158 patients, 378 matched con trols) was genotyped for this variant by PCR and RFLP using Hpy166II. Results: The variant (gnomAD maf < 1:10,000) was identi ï¬ed in heterozygosity in a 73 year old male patient with two affected ï¬rst degree relatives. p. G47R results in the replacement of glycine, a small amino acid with a non polar, aliphatic side chain, with arginine, an amino acid witha large positively charged side chain.

Variants of COMT, PRODH andDISC 1are risk factors for SZ and individually associated with executive functions and social cognition. Their combina tion may have epistaxis with signi ï¬cant effects on affected brain regions in SZ. Herein, we describe a cognitive molecular evaluation in Mexican SZ patients. Material and Methods: 9 variants of COMT ,1 5o f PRODH and 4 of DISC 1 were genotyped in 150 patients and 150 controls matched for age gender ethnicity. Theassociation between alleles/genotypes/haplotypes and the score in cognitive domains was evaluated by the battery MATRICS in a subgroup of 40 participants/group. Results: p. Val158Met COMT (p,0.0006, OR ,2.80, IC95%,1.54 5.09); p. Asp426Asn PRODH (p,0.02, OR,1.58, IC95% ,1.04 2.42) and p. Ser704Cys DISC 1 (p,0.0198, OR ,1.8, IC95% ,1.68 1.92) were associated with SZ. Risk alleles of COMT and PRODH in this subgroup were related to lower scores in MATRICS(p<0.01). The multivariate analysis suggested that COMT variants might participate in perception and management ofemotions in SZ patients (c.1 98A>G); while p. Val158Met and c. 225T>C were associated with lower scores in attention processes. The allele Val158 of COMT degrades catecholamines faster than the risk allele and has been related to ef ï¬ciency in attention tasks and other cognitive abilities. Conclusions: variants of these genes were con ï¬rmed with SZ risk. COMT variants were associated with alterations in tests assessing social cognition and working memory in SZ patients, but these results should be later conï¬rmed.

28753,"Federation,2Rostov State Medical University, Rostov on Don, Russian Federation Introduction: For a long time, the dysregulation in dopa mine signaling was considered a major mechanism of schizophrenia development. It is proposed that the increaseof dopamine production results in a psychiatric phenom enon called aberrant salience, which forces the brain to detect various external stimuli as important or life threatening. Polymorphisms of the dopamine metabolism genes MAOA andCOMT were studied in order to assess this hypothesis. Materials and Methods: The patient group consisted of 100 male and 98 female individuals who suffered from schizophrenia. The control group consisted of 71 indivi duals. Genomic DNA was extracted from whole blood samples. The potential in ï¬uence of the rs4680 COMT gene polymorphism and the MAOA LPR polymorphism onschizophrenia development was studied using PCR. Results: The study showed a lack of any signi ï¬cant differences between both groups studied in regard to theVal158Met COMT gene polymorphism. In case of the MAOA LPR polymorphism, there were signi ï¬cant differ ences between the groups regarding allelic frequencies. Thecontrol group exhibited a higher frequency of 4 tandem repeats in the promoter region of the gene (p<0,001). InAbstracts from the 51stEuropean Society of Human Genetics Conference: â¦ 969addition, the female patients demonstrated a higher rate of the 3 tandem repeats polymorphism than other gendered groups (p<0.05). Conclusions: We failed to establish the association of the Val158Met COMT gene polymorphism with an increased risk of schizophrenia. On the other hand, the allelesassociated with a decreased activity of the MAOA gene may potentially contribute to the disorder development.

28756,"Necmettin Erbakan University, Konya, Turkey,2Department of Pediatric Neurology, Meram Medical Faculty,Necmettin Erbakan University, Konya, Turkey Introduction: Dravet syndrome, also known as severe myoclonic epilepsy in infancy(SMEI), is an epilepticencephalopathy and a component of genetic epilepsy with febrile seizures plus(GEFS +) spectrum. Although patho genic variants of SCN1A is most common in etiology,plenty of other genes including SCN2A, held responsible for this disease. SCN2A encodes the brain sodium channel NaV1.2 which plays a signi ï¬cant role in generation and propagation of action potential in nerve cell. Materials and Methods: 13 years old female patient referred to our clinic with epilepsy, intellectual disability andexcessive sweating. The patient had febrile convulsion subsequent to routine vaccination at 5 months old. At age 3, she developed afebrile convulsions and followed by anti epileptics thereafter. Motor milestones were delayed. Her family history was uneventful except death of her father because of colon cancer at 28 years of age. In physicalexamination; tremor and avoidance of eye contact observed. Cranial MRI and genitourinary USG ï¬ndings were insigni ï¬cant. Results: Sequence analysis using NGS technology, showed no signi ï¬cant variation in SCN1A, SCN1B, GABRG2 and SCN9A. Whereas in SCN2A(NM_001040142), we found asubstitution(c.3454G>A, p. Ala1152Thr) that changes amino acid sequence. This variation have not been reported in Ensemble(Grch38) and CLINVAR databases. Conclusion: Because of biochemical differences between alanine and threonine, it seems likely that this variation could effect secondary and tertiary structure of brain sodiumchannel NaV1.2 which in turn could end up with phenotype described above. Further studies are needed to determine the exact effect of this variation on severity of disease andprognosis of patients. A. G. Zamani: None. L. Simsek: None. H. Caksen: None. M. S. Yildirim: None.

First of all, it was determinedthat these two patients were related to each other. After the affected individuals were identi ï¬ed in their families. In the pedigree analysis, it was found that the disease was trans mitted dominantly. The inheritance pattern of the disease has been determined. A neurological examination was performed to patients. Three major ï¬ndings were identi ï¬ed as a result of the neurological examination performed.1) both upper and lower motor neurons de ï¬cit (tongue fasi culation, clonus, babinski extensions)2) loss of musclepower in both upper and lower extremities (3/5) 3) unre sponsiveness at cerebellar physicial examination (dysmetry, dysdiadochokinesia). Mild cognitive retardation wasdetected in the mental examination of the patients. Dysar thria and tongue fasiculation was a severe ï¬nding in both patients. As the disease progressed, walking and balanceloss increased, resulting in wheelchair movement. Sig niï¬cant enlargement of cerebellar follicles, which were compatible with cerebellar atrophy, was found in brain MRimages of patients. In EMG, absence of sensory response was detected with lower motor neuron de ï¬cit. Bilateral sensorineural hearing loss was detected in the hearingexaminations of the patients and the patient was given hearing aid.

The condition is characterized by typical facial, ocular and auditory fea tures. Similar features are also found in Marshall syndrome leading to a continuing debate whether these are distinct entities or different manifestations of a single syndrome. Several mutations causing Stickler syndrome have been found in the COL2A1 gene, also mutations have been detected in the COL11A1 causing Stickler and Marshall syndrome. Here we present the ï¬rst genetically veri ï¬ed case of Marshall Stickler syndrome in Bulgaria a familial case spread through at least three generations. The proband is a2 years old girl with ocular hypertelorism, midface hypo plasia, small saddle nose with ï¬at bridge and craniofacial dysplasia. The proband âs father has the same clinical manifestations like the proband, but with a tall and thin stature and mild hearing loss. The same dysmorphology is presented also by the grandfather. Both the father and theproband are clinically diagnosed as Marshall Stickler syn drome. After a negative COL2A1 result, we provided a mutation screening of the COL11A1 gene and found a novel splicÐµ site mutation c.3474 +1G>A in intron 45. This var iant is related to the clinical presentation in the patient and his father. The variant c.3474 +1G>A affects the donor splice site of intron 45 resulting in altered splicing, which leads to production of a nonfunctional protein. The mutation affects the region coding the major triple helical domain,which represents a mutation âhot spot âfor the gene. M. Mladenova: None. T. Todorov: None. L. Grozda nova: None. V.

28761,"Department of Biology, Ecology and Earth Sciences, University of Calabria, Rende (Cs), Italy Physical function impairment with increasing age has been associated with substantial morbidity and mortality. Amino acid availability is a rate limiting factor in the regulation of muscle protein metabolism, and hence a risk factor for age related decline in muscle performance. Amino acid trans porters are emerging as sensors of amino acid availability and activators of mTORC1 signalling, acting astransceptors. Hence, we sought to evaluate the association of 58 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 10 selected aminoacid transporter genes with parameters of physical perfor mance (Hand Grip, Activity of Daily Living, and Walking time). By analysing a sample of 458 subjects aged 50 89years, we found signi ï¬cant associations with SLC7A5, SLC7A8, SLC36A1, SLC38A2, SLC3A2, SLC38A7 genes. Further investigation of the SNPs in a cross sectional study including 271 subjects aged 90 107 years revealed associations of SLC3A2, SLC38A2, SLC38A3, SLC38A9 variability with longevity. Finally, a longitudinalstudy examining the survival rate over 10 years showed age dependent complexity due to possible pleiotropiceffects on different phenotypes for SNPs in SLC36A1, and trade off dynamics for a SNP in SLC38A9, conferring a survival advantage before 90 years of age and disadvantage later. On the whole, our ï¬ndings support the hypothesis that amino acid transporters may impact on the age relatedphysical decline and survival at old age in a complex way, likely through a mechanism involving mTORC1 signalling.

The most common CHCHD10 related disease in the world is spinal muscular atrophy Jokela type (SMAJ, OMIM #615048), that is caused by mutation c.197G>T p. G66V. SMAJ is a relatively benign adult onset disorder,characterized by painful cramps and fasciculations affecting the proximal and distal muscles of the upper and lower limbs. The disease is slowly progressive, resulting inweakness and muscle atrophy later in life. In Finland, there are approximately 200 SMAJ patients due to a Finnish founder mutation c.197G>T p. G66V. Aims: We describe the ï¬rst patient homozygous for c.197G>T p. G66V. Results: The onset of the disease was already in childhood and at the age of 36 the patient became wheel chair bound. In contrast to heterozygous SMAJ, muscle biopsy shows clear mitochondrial pathology and thedegenerative muscle changes on MRI are extensive. The parents of the homozygous patient both belong to previously known SMAJ families and have a regular SMAJphenotype.

Thepatients usually present at birth with severe hypotonia, respiratory failure and facial dysmorphism. Increased fetal nuchal translucency (NT) and arthrogryposis were pre viously reported. Homozygous SLC6A9 mutations (solute carrier family 6 (neurotransmitter transporter, glycine), member 9 or glycine transporter, type 1) are the only knowncause of GLYT1 encephalopathy. Case report: We report on a young healthy and non consanguineous couple of German origin. They had twoconsecutive pregnancies with multiple fetal abnormalities. Theï¬rst fetus was female (46,XX) and presented with an increased NT >6mm, arthrogryposis and polyhydramnion(week 13 and 16). The pregnancy was terminated at 21 +weeks. The fetus in the second pregnancy was male (46, XY) and showed a very similar phenotype with early nuchaltranslucency (4,8 mm) and severe arthrogryposis on follow up scans. This pregnancy was also terminated. Exome analysis revealed a homozygous missense variant in theSLC6A9 gene (c.352G>A,p. Val118Met) in both children, both parents being heterozygous carriers. The variant is located in the ï¬rst transmembrane domain of the transporter. Several in vitro tools predict the exchange of a highly conserved amino acid. Conclusion: We postulate that this is the ï¬rst described famliy of non Arab origin with GLYT1 encephalopathy and theï¬rst family with a severe prenatal phenotype with increased nuchal translucency and arthrogryposis caused byamissense variant in SLC6A9 .U.

Causative mutations in four genes have been described: MYH3 ,TNNI2 ,TPM2 , and TNNT3 . We report the ï¬rst patient with typical SHS phenotype and exceptional vertebral fusions. Materials and Methods: An 8.5 year old boy was evaluated for dysmorphic facial features (triangular face with prominent nasolabial folds an d chin, arched eyebrows, and downslanting palpebral ï¬ssures), camptodactyly of both hands combined with clinodactyly of toes, and several tendon retractions. Left hand X ray showed a complete bony luno triquetral coalitio n. Spine MRI and CT scan revealed multiple cervical and dorsal vertebral fusions. Patient's karyotype and CGH array were normal. On susp icion of SHS, all the coding exons of MYH3 and of the adjacent intronic regions were investigated by high throughput next generation sequencing (NGS). Results: The novel, very rare heterozygous variation c.859T>G, p. Phe287Val was identi ï¬ed. This mutation produces a substitution of a Phenylalanine with a Valine at the position 287 and was predicted to be pathogenic byall the prediction programs used.

SLS is caused by mutations in the aldehyde dehydrogenasefamily 3 member A2 (ALDH3A2) gene that encodes a fatty aldehyde dehydrogenase (FALDH). Material and Methods: In this case, six years old boy consulted to our clinic with complaints of ichthyosis and inability to walk. The patient is son of a consanguineous couple who are ï¬rst cousins. Brain MRI had demonstrated bilateral periventricular subcortical white matter leukoma lacia. Karyotype and ALDH3A2 gene analysis planned due to these results. Results: Karyotype analysis showed no constitutional abnormality. Next generation sequencing analysis of ALDH3A2(NM_001031806.1) gene showed homozygoussubstitutionof c.799 1G>A(IVS5 1G>A) at the last nucleo tide of the 4th intron. This variant, is analysed in silica databases of âMutation Taster âand âHuman Splicing Finder âand suggested to be pathogenic. Parental genotypesshowed thatboth parents had the same mutation heterozygously. Conclusion: Uptodate, more than 90 different mutations of ALDH3A2 in SLS patients published. Since the location of the variant we are presenting, is on the splice site, it is probable that the variant can cause misregulation of splicingand can have effects on mRNA or protein products of the gene or the regulatory elements binding introns.

The sole previously reported LGMD1F family manifests notable variation of the phenotype regarding the age of onset, pre sentation and progression of muscle weakness affecting pelvic and shoulder muscles. Owing to the wide variation in the clinical picture of LGMDs, the precise diagnosis ofthese disorders is challenging. With the implementation of massively parallel sequencing (MPS) assays, the diagnostic accuracy and clari ï¬cation of the genetic background of these diseases has been signi ï¬cantly improved. Material and Methods: We used a previously developed targeted gene panel, MYOcap, to screen for possiblepathogenic variants in two affected members of a Swedish family with a childhood onset muscle weakness affecting proximal as well as distal muscles. The MYOcap assayconsists of 265 genes and 5394 exons that are known or suspected to cause muscular dystrophy or myopathy. Results: Our MYOcap assay identi ï¬ed a novel hetero zygous single nucleotide deletion c.2757delC in the affected members of the family. The deletion causes a frameshift inAbstracts from the 51stEuropean Society of Human Genetics Conference: â¦ 975exon 22 of the TNPO3 gene and is predicted to result in extension of the reading frame by 20 codons downstream (p. R920GfsX20). Conclusions: The predicted consequence of c.2757delC mutation is very similar to the previously reported mutation in the published LGMD1F family (c.2771delA p.*924Cext15).

In literature the 2q23.1 deletion syndrome is characterized by intellectual disability, speech impairment,autistic like behavior, sleep abnormalities, seizures, ataxia, microcephaly, hypotonia, initially feeding dif ï¬culties, later hyperphagia, coarse face, abnormalities of the ears and theeyes, open mouth, prominent incisors, tented upper lip, short hands and feet. The size of the described deletions varies (38 kb to 19 Mb) with the smallest region of overlapcontains only the MBD5 gene. The protein encoded by MBD5 is expressed in brain and is involved intranscriptional regulation interacting with e.g. MECP2. Symptoms of isolated MBD5 alterations and 2q23.1 dele tions overlap but some features (e.g. microcephaly, hyper phagia, open mouth with downturned corners, small hands/ feet) are observed predominantly in 2q23.1 deletion, sug gesting further deleted genes contribute to an extendedphenotype. Our case suggests that a recognizable phenotype and facial gestalt can be de ï¬ned in patients with a 2q23.1 deletion. C. B. Mueller Hofstede: None. A. RÃ¶pke: None. P. Wieacker: None. E",2018

We present a 3.5 year old girl with developmentaldelay and congenital abnormalities due to de novo 8q22.2q22.3 microdeletion. The girl was born to healthy non consanguineous parents at full term. Fetal ultrasoundshowed mild growth retardation. Birth weight was 2670 g, height 50 cm, OFC 31 cm. The patient had congenital hip dysplasia, bilateral foot deformity, and radioulnar synos tosis. Dysmorphic features included up slanting palpebral ï¬ssures, wide eyebrows, altered dermatoglyphics, short halluces, and hypertrichosis on the back, arms and forehead. Echocardiogram showed open foramen ovale and small secondary atrial septal defect. The psychomotor and lan guage development was severely delayed. She had stereo typic movements, including hand waving and head twisting. The patient had a seizure episode at age 2.5 years, but EEG showed no epileptic activity. The girl had hypermetropiaand atopic dermatitis. 8q22.2q22.3 deletion, 4.9 Mb in size (arr[hg19] 8q22.2q22.3 (99,938,470 104,936,546)x1) was identi ï¬ed by SNP array analysis.

The syndrome is char acterized by global developmental delay, hypotonia, obstructive sleep apnea, intellectual disability and seizures. Congenital heart defects were not described in patients withXia Gibbs syndrome. The patient was a 1,5 years old girl, theï¬rst child of healthy non consanguineous parents, born from the ï¬fth pregnancy (there were four miscarriages) complicated by polyhydramnios with small birth weight (3â°). Pulmonary artery stenosis with atrial septal defect, transient congenital stridor with laryngeal hypokinesis,corpus callosum hypoplasia with ventriculomegaly were diagnosed in the neonatal period. Feeding dif ï¬culties with gastroesophageal re ï¬ux and failure to thrive, strabismus divergens with hypermetropia, muscular hypotonia, psy chomotor retardation and dysmorphic features were evident from the ï¬rst months of age.

28773,"Introduction: Aicardi syndrome (AIS) is a rare disorder characterized by agenesis of the corpus callosum (ACC),distinctive chorioretinal lacunae and infantile spasms. It occurs almost exclusively in females. The cause is probably ade novo dominant X linked mutation, lethal in 46,XY males. Here we report a case of a 3 year old girl with typical AIS phenotype and MECP2 duplication. Results: Our patient, a 3 year old girl, has moderate global developmental delay. In infancy she developed infantile spasms and later on myoclonic seizures. She has axial hypotonia and wide gait with a pronounced spasticpattern. Brain MRI revealed ACC with additional anoma lies. Ophthalmologic exam showed two chorioretinal lacunae in the left eye. She is prone to viral infectionsand has mild facial dysmorphia. Chromosomal microarray revealed 254 kb long de novo Xq28 duplication, which encompasses six genes, including MECP2 andIRAK1 . Conclusion: In males, MECP2 duplication features are infantile hypotonia, developmental delay/intellectual dis ability, poor/absent speech, progressive spasticity, recurrentinfections and seizures. Most female carriers are asympto matic due to skewed X inactivation. Only 19 symptomatic females have been reported so far. Our patient âs phenotype is consistent with MECP2 duplication, except chorioretinal lacunae that are a hallmark of the AIS. This is the ï¬rst case linking these two conditions, pointing to the possibility thatthe gene for AIS might be within the Xq28 region. The gene of interest is FLNA , located distally of the duplication in our patient. FLNA causes periventricular heterotopia often seen in AIS cases which makes him a good candidate for AIS phenotype.

It is caused by mutations in the ALMS1 gene which encodes the ALMS1 protein, a structural component of centrosome involved in intracellular transport among many other roles. We analyzed the sequence of ALMS1 in a cohort of 11 unrelated ALMS families. Several mutations were identi ï¬ed in exons 7, 8, 16 and 17. Most of the mutations were found in exon 8. Two mutations had a high incidence in thecohort: p.(Tyr1714 *) (exon 8; rs772136379) with 36% and p.(Ser3872Tyrfs * 19) (exon 17), with 27%. We described one homozygote for p.(Tyr1714 *) mutation and one for p.(Ser3872Tyrfs * 19), all the other families with this mutations were compound heterozygotes. Segregation analysis showed that the p.(Tyr1714 *) mutation is linkedto the SNP rs45608038 which presents a low frequency (â2%) in European populations. ALMS patients usually account for private mutations. For theï¬rst time we can see mutations with a large incidence in an ALMS cohort. Additional analyzes are underway to decipher whether these families maintain a genealogicalrelationship, although families have been recruited from different national geographic areas and none of them reported to have kinship relations with the other ones. Ifthe common heritage of mutation p.(Tyr1714 *) were demonstrated, we could be talking about a founder allele for Spanish patients. B. Bea Mascato: None. M. Ãlvarez Satta: None. C. Ayuso: None. M.

Although in several countries it is a ï¬rst tier test for patients with intellectual disability (ID) or withmultiple congenital anomalies (MCA), in our country it represents an expensive technique and a very few labora tories have begun to implement it. Karyotyping remains tobe the routine study in public health. Aim: To report the ï¬ndings in an Argentinean cohort of patients with ID and patients with MCA. Materials and Methods: we studied 165 patients with two arrayCGH plataforms (Agilent ISCA v2 60K and KaryoArray Â®v3.0 8x60K): 125 had ID and 40 had MCA. They did not show a cytogenetic anomaly or had a failed karyotype test. Abstracts from the 51stEuropean Society of Human Genetics Conference: â¦ 979Results: We found that 14/125 (11%) ID patients had causal or potentially causal CNVs: 11 were recognizable syndromes and 2 had an imbalance associated with a microdeletion syndrome accompanied with other patho genic imbalance. Besides, 10/40 (26%) MCA patients presented causal or potentially causal CNVs: 2 werechromosomal anomalies, 3 were recognizable syndromes and 1 had a microdeletion syndrome accompanied with other pathogenic imbalance. Conclusion: ArrayCGH was useful to perform an accurate analysis of microdeletions or duplications that could not be detected by standard karyotyping. Thepercentage of pathogenic imbalances was higher in patients with MCA than in those with ID in accordance with the data reported in the literature. L. D. Espeche: None. M. Delea: None. S.

Pretibial linear vertical creases are a rareï¬nding associated with arthrogryposis, and the etiology of the speci ï¬c condition is unknown. Materials and Methods: Whole exome sequencing, segregation analysis and bioinformatics analysis were used to genetically characterize a boy from a consanguineous family, presenting with AMC and pretibial vertical linearcreases on the shins. Results: Whole exome sequencing and variant analysis revealed homozygous novel missense variants of ECEL1 (c.1163T>C, p. Leu388Pro, NM_004826), and MUSK (c.2572C>T, p. Arg858Cys, NM_005592). Both variants are predicted to have deleterious effects on the proteinfunction, with amino acid positions highly conserved among species. The variants segregated in the family, with healthy mother, father and sister being heterozygous carriersand the index patient being homozygous for both mutations. Conclusion: We report on a unique patient with a novel ECEL1 homozygous mutation, expanding the phenotypic spectrum of Distal Arthrogryposis Multiplex Congenita Type 5D to include vertical linear skin creases. The homozygous mutation in MUSK is of unknown clinical signiï¬cance.

Other common manifestations include hearing loss, short stature, seizures, intellectual de ï¬cit of variable severity, and abnormalities of the urinary system. This syndrome is caused by missense variations in ACTB or ACTG1 . Materials and Methods: We diagnosed a 5 year old Turkish boy as Baraitser Winter syndrome with typical clinical features. All coding exons and the ï¬anking intronic regions of the ACTB andACTG1 genes were ampli ï¬ed by PCR followed by bidirectional direct sequencing. Varia tions were detected by comparing the reference sequences and interpreted by in silico predictive programs. Results: We identi ï¬ed a novel heterozygous sequence change, c.332A>G [p.(Asn111Ser)] which is located at the exon 3 of ACTB . This variation is not present in single nucleotide polymorphism and 1000 genomes databases; moreover, in silico analysis using SIFT, PolyPhen2 and Mutation Taster predicts as potentially deleterious.

BWS is caused by various 11p15 genetic or epigenetic defects leading to abnormal expression of imprinted genes. The genes in the11p15 region are organized into two imprinted domains: ICR1 and ICR2. A small number of BWS cases (2 8%) are due to copy number variations (CNVs) in thechromosome 11p15. Materials and Methods: We present epigenetic/genetic/ clinical pro ï¬les of three patients with BWS. Molecular analyses were performed on leukocyte DNA and com prised: MS MLPA, SNuPE, arrayCGH and FISH. Results: In all patients aberrant methylation was associated with the presence of paternal origin CNVs, including: duplication of the whole 11p15 region (unba lanced translocation with involvement of 7p22.3 deletion),duplication of ICR1 and part of ICR2, and duplication of ICR1. Patients demonstrated typical features for BWS, additionally, the patient with duplication of the whole11p15 region had developmental delay and facial dys morphism. All identi ï¬ed CNVs were present on maternal alleles of the patients âhealthy fathers. Conclusions: The study shows that interpreting of 11p15 CNVs is challenging and phenotypic consequences may depend on the localization, size, as well as the parentalorigin of the aberrant segment. A complex molecular approach to analyze 11p15 region is required for accurate diagnosis of BWS allowing the recurrence risk determina tion and proper genetic counseling.

Additionally, CSC KT patients exhibit facial dysmorphism (epicanthal folds, upslanting palpebral ï¬s sures, hypertelorism), cleft palate, growth retardation, intellectual disability (ID) and multiple congenital mal formation. Recently, 2 heterozygous mutations in TUBB gene and 4 mutations (both homozygous and heterozygous) inMAPRE2 gene were identi ï¬ed in 3 and 4 patients, respectively, with CSC KT. In the 3 TUBB gene related CSC KT patients, all mutations falled in the N terminal domain of the gene and were de novo . Mutations in the C terminal of TUBB gene are associated to microcephaly and structural brain malformation, in the absence of sign or symptoms of the CSC KT. Here, we report a 9 year old boy in whom the diagnosis of CSC KT was suggested, based onthe presence of MTBS, typical facial dysmorphism, microcephaly, severe ID and brain malformation, including cortical atrophy and corpus callosum hypoplasia. Sangersequencing identi ï¬ed a novel heterozygous c. 218 T>C (p. Met73Thr) variant in the N terminal of TUBB gene.

Here, we extend this paradigm by evaluating novel bioinformaticsapproaches to aim? identi ï¬cation of new gene disease associations. Materials and Methods: We performed massive parallel sequencing on MiSeq (Illumina) using panel Clinical Exome kit by Sophia Genetics, followed by Sanger sequencing, CNV and MLPA analysis. This solutionconsists of 116,355 individually designed probes that span approx.. 11 Mb of target regions covering more than 4,900 genes, with known mendelian/inherited disease causingmutations. Results: Altogether, we have tested 5 family trios (mother, father and child) using Clinical Exome kit. Duringthe testing of clinical exome we required to obtained all the relevant genetic diagnosis and clinical phenotype informa tion of the analysed patients. These 3 families werediagnosed mainly of the heritable disorders like Ollier syndrome â¯. In summary, we have found causal DNA variants in genes already associated with a phenotype. Wehave also identi ï¬ed pathogenic or potential pathogenic variants in other genes, which are probably not associated with disease, however their clinical interpretation is unclearand should be ï¬nalized in the cooperation of clinical and molecular geneticist. These results demonstrate the ef ï¬ ciency of exome sequencing approach in performingmolecular diagnosis of undiagnosed genetic disease. Conclusions: We have tested patients to detect a mutation in gene of undiagnosed genetic disease. R. MichalovskÃ¡: None. T. Pis: None. L. Hruskova: None. A. Jurcekova: None. R. Alanova: None. Z.

28786,"Medical Genetics â, Moscow, Russian Federation,2Genomed ltd., Moscow, Russian Federation Introduction: Complex chromosome rearrangements (CCR) are extremely rare in humans. Most apparently balanced CCRs are de novo and usually detected in phe notypically normal subjects. But in some cases found in patients with congenital abnormalities and/or mental retar dation which may be due to cryptic genomic imbalance. Wereport an exceptional CCR in a child with mental retarda tion, microcephaly, muscular hypotension, corpus callosum hypoplasia. Materials and Methods: G banding analysis revealed a de novo CCR involving the chromosomes 4, 5, 7. By FISH984 J. del Picchiausing different types of probes (PCP, MCB, subtelomeric) it was possible to clarify how the chromosomes were rearranged and to determine the breakpoints. aCGH was applied for detection of genomic imbalance. Results: Conventional karyotyping showed translocation t(4;5;7)(q31;q32;p21)dn. MCB analysis of chromosomes 4,5, 7 was employed to delineate the breakpoints in every chromosome. Unexpectedly we detected that a segment of 4 (q31.23q32.2) was inserted in the derivative chromosome 5(q31.1). Arm speci ï¬c and subtelomeric probes were applied to con ï¬rm the insertion 4q in 5q. Furthermore, aCGH analysis showed four cryptic deletions associated with thebreakpoints on chromosomes 4 and 5. Conclusions: Initially, CCR described here was inter preted as balanced, and derived from a three waytranslocation between chromosomes 4, 5, 7. However, FISH and aCGH analysis revealed that the rearrangement was far more complex than originally estimated involving alarger number of breaks. Only a combination of several different approaches was suf ï¬cient to resolve the nature of this CCR which had an unexpected level of complexity,involving 3 chromosomes, 5 breakpoints, 1 insertion and 4 deletions.

Findings Results: A 17 year old male with multiple anomalies was referred to our polyclinic for genetic evaluation and clari ï¬cation of the diagnosis. There were chronic cough, torticollis, short stature, glaucoma and microphthalmia on the anamnesis and physical examination of the patient. Computerized spiral tomography of chest andmagnetic resonance imaging of brain performed respec tively, there were widespread bronchiectasis, multiple arachnoid cysts, ventriculomegaly and microphthalmia. 6cousins and 2 siblings of the patient died due to similar ï¬ndings and because his parents were relatives blood was taken from the family to perform whole exom sequencing. Homozygous mutation in the PRESS56 gene (c.571G>T), homozygous mutation in the MCIDAS gene (c.904C>T)were detected in the patient. Mother and father were found to be carriers in terms of these mutations. Conclusions: Next generation sequencing should be preferred in patients with complex genotype resulting multiple anomalies. M.

More than 50 genes have been reported as mutated in CAKUT affected cases. Recently, mutations in genes encoding Fraser syndrome protein 1 ( FRAS1 ), FRAS1 related extracellular matrix protein 2 ( FREM2 ) and gluta mate receptor interacting protein 1 ( GRIP1 ) cause CAKUT. A patient with consanguineous parents underwent whole exome sequencing to identify the causative gene(s) for his unilateral small kidney, relatively hypouricemia and mental retardation. After WES, we narrowed down our search forcandidate genes to 48 responsible for the small kidney phenotype. Lastly, we identi ï¬ed a FREM2 homozygous mutation (c. C4030T, p. R1344C) and a GRIP1 homozygous mutation (c. C692T, p. A231V) probably associated with unilateral small kidney. In silico analysis revealed that R1344C in FREM2 was probably damaging, and thatA231V in GRIP1 was benign. R1344 in FREM2 is evolu tionarily conserved, and is located within chondroitin sul fate proteoglycan repeats, which could be the bindingdomain for several growth factors. Furthermore, the late patient âs brother and sister manifested a relatively bilateral small kidney and normal kidney. However, his genotypingwas a GRIP1 homozygous mutation without FREM2 mutation, and her genotyping was a FREM2 and GRIP1 heterozygous mutation. Therefore, these results suggest thatthe mutation in FREM2 is pathogenic and might be asso ciated with the unilateral small kidney phenotype. This is theï¬rst report of homozygous missense mutation in FREM2 found in a patient with a unilateral small kidney in a Japanese family. S. Katayama: None. N. Takeuchi: None. Y. Hozumi: None. A.

It could be result ofacquired diseases, inborn errors of metabolism or congenital defects. In some patients abnormalities in associated eyes structures often coexist with inborn defects of other organsbeing one of the symptoms of a speci ï¬c syndrome, but sometimes it could be an isolated entity. One of them is congenital ï¬brosis of extraocular muscles (CFEOM). CFEOM is a complex condition with AR or AD inheritance and high clinical variability as a result of mutation in one of at least six genes. Some patients may have unilateral eyeinvolvement. Here we report a family with CFEOM. In a 10 years old boy ptosis of eyelids, exotropia and ï¬ngers camptodactyly were present since the neonatal period. Physical examination additionally revealed severe limited movement of eyes, small facial dysmorphic features. In other family members (mother, aunt, grandmother andcousin) only abnormalities in associated structures of eyes were reported. aCGH revealed in the boy a small 14q31.3q32.11 duplication of uncertain clinical sig niï¬cance. Based on clinical symptoms, a mutation in TUBB3 gene has been suspected. A p. Arg190Cys (c.568C>T, rs267607162) mutation registered in theHGMD and in ClinVar as pathogenic variant was identi ï¬ed in affected boy and other family members. The CFEOM3A was con ï¬rmed in this family.

CHD are also frequently accompanied by genetic syndromes. Usually, additional features along with CHD are observed in thesesyndromes. The genetic cause of the syndromes can be single gene mutations and copy number variations. Because the clinical picture of patients with different syndromes canoverlap, it is very important that a good clinical examination is performed, which leads to a better diagnosis of these conditions. Material and Methods: A 10 moths old boy was referred for NGS analysis due to the CHD observed during the pregnancy. After birth vesicoureteral re ï¬ux, muscular hypotonia, cleft palate, and mild microcephaly was noted. The prenatal testing was performed for observed CHD, which included classical karyotyping, molecular karyotyp ing and QF PCR for exclusion of aneuploides and microdeletions/microduplications syndromes. All genetic tests were negative. NGS analysis was performed withpanel covering more than 4800 disease associated genes. Analysis was initially focused on genes associated with CHD, but no clinically signi ï¬cant variants were detected. Only after the extended genetic analysis, which also included genes related to additional features observed in our patients, enabled us the detection of a previouslyundescribed frameshift mutation c.11093delG in KMT2D gene which is associated with Kabuki syndrome. Conclusion: Broad spectrum of clinical features observed in Kabuki patients and its rare incidence disables the easy recognition of this syndrome.

It has been estimated to occur in about 1:10 000 individuals where severe forms of CdLS are revealed easilly, but as moremildly affected individuals have been reported, its actual prevalence may be much more common. Diagnostics of CdLS is complicated with a presence of clinically over lapping syndromes. Methods: Our custom NGS panel (completed by MLPA) encompasses genes associated not only with a speci ï¬c diagnosis (CdLS in this case) but also with diseases, which are hardly distinguishable from CdLS because of their phenotypic similarity. Results: To date we have investigated 13 pacients with CdLS clinical diagnosis. Four of them (three children and one fetus) carried pathogenic variants in NIPBL gene or SMC3 gene, so their diagnosis was con ï¬rmed on molecular level. Our custom NGS panel includes genes related with clinically overlapping syndromes, so we were able toidentify pathogenic variants in ANKRD11 gene ( KBG syndrome ) and AFF4 gene ( CHOPS syndrome ) in two children patients. Conclusions: For a routine molecular testing it âs important to create custom NGS panels with a great prudence. Only in this case it can be a successful diagnostictool which can solve the issue with molecular diagnostics of clinically overlapping syndromes. J. Pospisilova: None. V. Krutilkova: None. P.

The couple was healthy, unrelated and of South American origin. Level IIultrasonography (US) revealed a cystic hygroma, complete agenesis of corpus callosum, aortic valvular stenosis with aortic hypoplasia, left ventricular hypoplasia and ventricularseptal defect, ï¬exion deformity of hands. Brain abnormality was con ï¬rmed at MRI. Materials and Methods: Agilent Technologies 60K Chromosomal MicroArray (CMA) performed on amniotic ï¬uid cells revealed a loss of 21,5 Mb of chromosome 21q11.2q22.12, encompassing many OMIM genes, 8 ofwhich are known to be disease associated. CMA also showed two small imbalances inherited from the healthy mother. The imbalance appeared as a complete chromo some 21 monosomy upon cytogenetic analysis of cultured cells. Maternal karyotype was normal, whereas paternal one revealed a 1p22 p36.1 paracentric inversion. FISH analysiswith a probe speci ï¬c for subtelomeric 21q regions (Vysis) was normal for both parents.

In the past few years array CGH changed the diagnostic approach to many con genital diseases offering an accurate detection of chromo some imbalances. Material and Methods: A 6 months old girl, the third child of the couple with history of infertility, was referred toour genetic center because of developmental delay, dysmorphic features, agenesis of corpus callosum, sacral dimple, abnormal skin pigmentation with linear intercostallocalisation, growth retardation. Cytogenetic analysis showed a derivative chromosome 21 inherited apparently from her mother and arrayCGH result was: arr[hg19]13q12.11 q12.3(20407295 31729705)x3,21q11.2 q21.3 (15485008 30013630)x1. FISH testing was necessary to clarify the results. Discussion: The patient presented a visible abnormal chromosome 21, apparently inherited from a normal mother. The abnormal phenotype of the proband suggestedthe continuation of the investigation efforts. ArrayCGH and FISH were subsequently applied and showed a proximal duplication of about 11,3 Mb of 13q12.11 q12.3 and aproximal deletion of about 14,5 Mb of 21q11.2 q21.3. The childâs der(21) was con ï¬rmed to be inherited from a maternal balanced translocation between 13q and 21q. Thisstructural chromosomal abnormality exposes the mother to a high risk of offspring affected by unbalanced chromoso mal disorder and could explain her infertility. Conclusions: Without complete investigation of subtle rearrangements, genetic counseling is a real challenge.

Tounderstand the role of common variants of TERT and TP53 genes on the diversity of DS phenotype, the frequency of these two variants was aimed to be investigated. The TERTgene rs2736100 A C intronic variant is known with its association with various morbidities. The TP53 gene codon72 Arg>Pro variant is related with altered TP53 protein functions. Allele distributions of these common variants were assessed between DS and control children. Materials and Methods: DS (n:80) and control (n:32) subjects were included in this study. TERT gene rs2736100 A C intronic variant and TP53 gene p. Arg72Pro (c. C215G)variant was determined with melting analysis of hybridiza tion probes. Results: The allele frequency of TERT and TP53 variants were not different between DS and control groups, however allele frequencies were higher than that of the highest population level. The TERT variant distribution was similarin the control group of children with homozygous Pro72 variant or Arg72 variant carriers. The variant distribution of TERT, however, was signi ï¬cantly lower in DS group of children with homozygous Pro72 variant compared to Arg72 variant carriers. Conclusion: Similar distribution of the common variants of TERT and TP53 genes are implying that these variants may contribute to DS phenotype by more complex associations.

It can be isolated or syndromic. When associated with nephrocalci nosis, the condition is designated as Â« enamel renal syn drome Â» or Â« amelogenesis imperfecta type IG Â» (OMIM 204690), and is consecutive to biallelic mutations ofFAM20A gene. The encoding protein is involved in the manufacture and maturation of enamel. However, the mechanism explaining the renal damage remains unclear. Rare, this autosomal recessive condition is often observed in consanguineous families. We report on 2 new patients from distinct and non consanguineous families. The ï¬rst, 14 year old, had amelogenesis imperfecta and nephro calcinosis without impact on renal function, accidentallyAbstracts from the 51stEuropean Society of Human Genetics Conference: â¦ 989discovered at age 6 (abdominal pain). Two heterozygous mutations were discovered in FAM20A : c.1192G>T [p. (Asp398Tyr)] and c.1228_1229del [p.(Asp410Profs*5)]. The second, 6 year old, had isolated amelogenesis imper fecta.

These obser vations con ï¬rm that the emergence of rare diseases of autosomal recessive inheritance is also possible in non consanguineous families. The absence of nephrocalcinosis in the second patient does not question the diagnosis ofenamel renal syndrome, and emphasizes that FAM20A mutations must also be investigated in isolated amelogen esis imperfecta. Nephrocalcinosis is inconstant, unapparent,and most often observed later in life. In enamel renal syn drome, the risk for renal function justify the organization of a rigorous renal supervision. F.

28799,"Medical Genetic, Ankara, Turkey Introduction: Oculodentodigital dysplasia (ODDD) is a rare condition characterized by typical facial appearance and variable ï¬ndings of the eyes, teeth and ï¬ngers. Besides ocular manifestations like microphtalmia, microcornea, iris abnormalities and glaucome, small nose, microdontia, dental anomalies, syndactyly of the 4th 5th ï¬ngers (type III syndactyly), absent phalanx of the toes and dry hair can also be seen in individuals with this syndrome. ODDD is caused by mutations in the GJA1 gene on chromosome 6q22 q24 and inherited in an autosomal dominant manner in the majority of the patients. However, in recent clinical reports, autosomal recessive ODDD cases caused by GJA1 muta tions were also described. Case Report: Here we report a 14 year old boy with microphtalmia, microcornea, narrow nasal bridge, hypo plastic alae nasi, prominent columnella, hypodontia and partial syndactyly of 2rd 3th toes. These clinical ï¬ndings were consistent with the diagnosis of ODDD, and a novelhomozygous mutation, c.442C>T, p. Arg148Ter was deter mined in GJA1 gene causing to premature stop codon. His healthy parents were found to be carriers for the samemutation. Conclusion: p. Arg148Ter mutation in GJA1 gene that encodes the transmembrane protein, connexin43 (Cx43) isresponsible for the clinical features of the patient causing to premature stop codon and probably, leading to a truncated990 J. del Picchianon functional protein. Up to now, autosomal recessive ODDD has been reported in eleven patients from six families but, only two of these cases were con ï¬rmed by molecular analysis. This is the third mutation described so far in the literature leading to autosomal recessive form of ODDD. E. Tasdelen: None. C. D. Durmaz: None. H. G. Karabulut: None. E",2018

Universidade de BrasÃ­lia, BrasÃ­lia, Brazil,5Department of Clinical Genetics, Erasmus University Medical Center, Rotterdam, Netherlands Introduction: We describe a four month old Brazilian boy with semilobar holoprosencephaly, fronto nasal encephalo celes and bilateral cleft lip and palate. Malformationsincluded agenesis of the corpus callosum, abnormal cortical gyres, dilation of the aqueduct, bilateral endolymphatic sac, bilateral cystic cocci vestibular malformation and a cribri form defect. The 3D TC craniofacial images showed abnormal frontonasal transition region, with a bone bifur cation and partial agenesis of nasal bone. The trunk andupper and lower limbs were normal. Methods: G banding karyotype and SNP array. Results: Karyotype was normal. SNP array showed no copy number alterations but revealed a high rate of regions of homozygosity with normal copy number (ROH). The coefï¬cient of inbreeding is 25%, suggesting that the proband was a result of a parent offspring or a full siblings relationship, which signi ï¬cantly increases the risk for an autosomal recessive disorder. Searches in theGenomic Oligoarray and SNP array tool for recessive disorders did not reveal any gene or disorder within the patient âs ROH that matched his clinical features. STIL and FGF8 , two recessive holoprosencephaly genes, do not map within our patient âs ROH. Conclusion: To our knowledge, this rare association of holoprosencephaly with fronto naso orbital encephaloceles without limb anomalies has never been reported before. Noknown recessive disorder matches our patient âs clinical symptoms. These results suggest that a recessive mutation in a new gene could be responsible for this rare association. It is also possible that these atypical clinical ï¬ndings are the result of a multiple recessive or complex molecular diagnosis. Grants: CAPES, CNPq, FAPEMIG. A. Richieri Costa: None. R. A.C.

She is the second liveborn from a 30 year old healthy mother. Prenatal ultrasound showedcystic cysterna magna and MRI follow up revealed ven tricular dilatation. She was born at 38 +3 weeks gestation. Macrocephaly and buphthalmos was noted at birth. She wasoperated for glaucoma. She was evaluated in pediatric genetics clinic for dysmorphic facial features and develop mental delay. The heterozygous loss in 6p25.3 resulted inloss of 6 OMIM annotated genes including the transcription factor FOXC1 gene. This gene plays an important role in eye, brain and heart development. Microdeletions of thisregion are known to be associated with microcephaly, dis tinct clinical features, like sensorineural hearing loss, ante rior chamber eye defects, cardiac defects and developmentaldelay. The gain in 15q26.1 3 includes 17 OMIM genes including IGF1R gene, which we speculate explains the macrocephaly, instead of microcephaly. This patientdemonstrates the combination of two copy number variants where the loss (deletion) predominates the phenotype and additional ï¬ndings are likely to be addressed to the genes in the gain (duplication) segment. We conclude that patients with a relatively well delineated microdeletion syndrome as 6p deletion shouldbe thoroughly evaluated for additional copy number variants when presenting with atypical or unusual pheno typical ï¬ndings with emphasis on all genes involved in the imbalance.

It is caused by mutations in KMT2D and KDM6A genes that are involved in histone methylation and thus leading to epigenetic dysregulation. KS is char acterized by distinctive facial features, intellectual dis ability, postnatal growth retardation and various structuralanomalies. Other ï¬ndings such as increased susceptibility to infections and autoimmune disorders have also been observed. Cancer predisposition in KS remains uncertainand it has been described in less than 10 cases so far. We report 10 year old boy with typical facial features of KS, fetal ï¬ngertip pads, intellectual disability, complex heart defect, minor skeletal anomalies, hearing loss and short stature due to growth hormone de ï¬ciency. He also suffered from IgA and IgG hypogammaglobulinemia andwas operated due to neuroblastoma in the 3 rdmonth of his life. No imbalance was detected in array CGH. Targeted gene sequencing revealed a novel, truncating variant (c.2063_2064del/ p. Arg688Profs*6) in exon 10 of KMT2D gene which con ï¬rmed diagnosis of KS in the patient. Additionally performed assay showed bleomycin induced chromosome breakage at a rate of bordeline value (0,74 vs 0,8, which was a cut off value adopted in our facility). Histone methyltransferase encoded by KMT2D gene is a major epigenetic factor which interacts with other protein complexes regulating expression of multiple genes andmany cell functions. The present observation of chromo some breakage in a patient with Kabuki syndrome may therefore indicate its signi ï¬cance for chromatin stability and affect clinical characteristics and management of the disease.

The most wide spread karyotype in affected patients is 47,XXY, but various other karyotypes have been described. The aim ofthis study was to examine the karyotypes of a group of our patients suspected of having Klinefelter's syndrome. Materials and Methods: Since 1993, 98 adult KS patients have been evaluated in the Laboratory of Cytogenetics and Molecular Genetics Clinic of Hematol ogy, Clinical Center of Serbia. Cytogenetic analysis wascarried out on metaphases obtained from phytohemagglutinin stimulated peripheral lymphocytes using a standard procedure. Fluorescence in situ hybridiza tion (FISH) analysis was performed on peripheral blood specimens. Vysis CEP X/Y alpha satellite DNA probes were used to detect X and Y chromosomes. Results: We identi ï¬ed KS with the âclassical âkaryotype in 77 patients, KS with a mosaic karyotype 47,XXY/46, XX in three and 47,XXY/46,XY in four (con ï¬rmed by FISH), KS with the âclassical âkaryotype together with other autosomal chromosomal abnormalities in six, and KS with other numerical sex chromosome abnormalities 48,XXYYin two (con ï¬rmed by FISH) and 47,XYY in six patients.

Clinical Report: An 18 year old female patient followed up to the psychiatric department due to anxiety disorder and nocturnal enuresis. She had no mental retardation but her school performance was low. She had short stature, hypotelorism, trident posterior hairline,cubitus valgus, atrial septal defect and irregular menses with normal uterine and ovarian morphology. Her gonado tropin and sex hormone levels was within the normal range. Materials/Methods: Karyotype analysis was performed from two separate lymphocyte cultures from the peripheralblood sample and ï¬broblast culture from the antecubital skin. Additionally, we evaluated the chromosome X and chromosome 18 numbers with ï¬uorescent in situ hybridiza tion (FISH) technique. Results: A total of 100 metaphases were counted from the lymphocyte cultures of the patient. There were 68metaphases with 47,XX, +18; 27 metaphases with 45,X; and 5 metaphases with 46,XX karyotype.

Materials and Methods: We present a genetic examina tion of 3359 samples (2012 2017 y.). 2,947 prenatalsamples of fetuses (villus chorionic, amniotic cells, cord blood) were analyzed by BACs on Beads technology (PerkinElmer, Finland). 412 samples of whole blood fromchildren with clinical signs of chromosomal abnormalities, who were born in the same period were performed by multiplex ligase ampli ï¬cation of probes (MLPA) (MRC Holland, Netherland). DNA was examined for aneuploidy at 13, 18, 21, X, Y chromosomes and 9 microdeletion syndromes. Results: The number of microstructural chromosome disturbances was detected more often for children than in the fetal materials (17.5% vs. 1.5%).

28818,"1Clinical Hospital Filantropia, Bucharest, Romania,2Clinical Hospital Pantelimon, Bucharest, Romania Introduction: Whole exome sequencing (WES) uses Next Generation sequencing technology (NGS) to identifymutations in all the coding regions of an individuals âgen ome. WES is useful when an individual is presenting multiple phenotypical characteristics that are not suggestivefor a speci ï¬c syndrome. We present a case of a six year old boy presenting with upper limb asymmetry, hemangioma of the distal phalanx of the index ï¬nger on the left hand, hemihypertrophy and extended hemangioma of the left hemithorax. The abnormal vascularization pattern of the left hemithorax was observed in the third trimester of preg nancy. Based on the clinical presentation, our suspicion was of Proteus syndrome. Material and Method: Due to genetic heterogeneity of Proteus syndrome, WES was performed for genetic conï¬rmation. Results: The WES analysis was unable to con ï¬rm Proteus syndrome or other cause for the child âs phenotype, due to possible somatic mosaicism or technical limitation of the method. Noteworthy two incidental ï¬ndings responsible of long QT syndrome and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy were reported. Conclusion: A very important issue in communicating WES results are incidental ï¬ndings. They represent mutations discovered by WES that can be associated with diseases which can affect the individual throughout his life. In our case, although the test didn ât identify a genetic cause for the patient âs phenotype, the incidental ï¬ndings suggest that cardiological monitoring could be life saving. Alsofamilial genetic testing of above mentioned mutations is adviced. Acknowledgements: The probe was analised at Cento gene Laboratory. F. Nedelea: None. I. Iordanescu: None. A. Mocanu: None. T.

The penetrance of BCNS is complete and the expressivity is variable. The most characteristic clinicalmanifestation is the development of multiple basal cell carcinomas at a young age; other common ï¬ndings are: odontogenic keratocysts, calci ï¬ed falx cerebri, skeletal anomalies, palmoplantar pits, macrocephaly and dys morphisms. BCNS is mainly caused by mutations in PTCH1 gene, the âprotein patched homolog âgene: an onco suppressor gene that maps at 9q22.32 region. Other genes that can be involved in the disease are SUFU and less commonly PTCH2 . Those genes participate in the âsonic hedgehog â(SHH) signaling pathway. A disease related to BCNS is the 9q22.3 microdeletion syndrome. This syn drome has an overlapping clinical phenotype with theBCNS, but it can also present other possible ï¬ndings in addition: metopic craniosynostosis, pre and post natal overgrowth, obstructive hydrocephalus, developmentaldelay, intellectual disability and seizures. This condition is caused by the deletion of a genome region containing the PTCH1 and the FANCC genes. Here we report the case of a 11 years old girl that came to our attention for overgrowth, dysmorphic features of the face and craniosynostosis, but with a normal intellectual and motor development. Wepresent this case because it is the ï¬rst one with a PTCH1 mutation (p. Val502Glyfs*13) and a 9q22.3 microdeletion syndrome phenotype. This ï¬nding may strengthen the importance of the role of the PTCH1 gene especially regarding the metopic craniosynostosis. B. Beltrami: None. G. Tolva: None. E. Prada: None. G. Scuvera: None. R.

They are caused mostly by mutations in the RAS/MAP kinase signaling pathway. According to the clinical presentation and speci ï¬c mutation, they are distributed in several subgroups. Phenotypic changes include facial dysmorphism, short stature, cardiacdefects, haematological disturbances and variable neu ropsychiatric problems. The mutations in PTPN11 gene are most commonly presented, followed by mutations in othergenes KRAS, HRAS. SOS1, etc. We present ten patients with clinical phenotype of Noonan syndrome. Phenotypic presentation is consistant with the diagnosis and includeshort stature, variable cardiac defects, skin and hair changes, genital anomalies in some. Facial changes include hyper telorism, antimongoloid eye slanting, long philtrum, dentalmaloclusion, low set ears, pterigia, etc. Two of the patients had hearing impairment. Molecular analysis was performed by the NGS method including genes: NRAS, ROT1,SCHOC2, HRAS, CBL, KRAS, PTPN11, SPRED1, MAP2K1, NF1 and MAP2K2. In 60% of evaluated patients mutations in PTPN11, RAF1 and KRAS genes were found. In four patients with typical NS features no mutations were found so far. Intelectual disability varies in all patients, ranging from minor to profound. Our ï¬ndings indicate that mutation distribution in RASopathies are similar to those in other studies. Further molecular evaluation is needed in order to reveal all mutations in patients with NS.

Physical examination revealed height of 71 cm (<4rd) and weightof 7000 g (<3rd). G banding analysis at a band resolution of >550 was performed, followed by FISH using probes 15q11 13 (SNRPN) for Prader Willi/Angelman and15q26.3 for internal control. Results: The karyotype showed a constitutive chromo somal aberration, 46,XX,r(15)[64]/46,XX,r(15)dup(15)[16]/47,XX, +r(15)[5]. FISH analysis con ï¬rmed the karyo type results and showed two more different cell lines 46,XX [9]/45,XX, 15[6]. In r(15) was detected the absence of the15q26.3 signal resulting in a genetic material loss, region that harboring IGF1R gene responsible for biological activity of IGF1. Conclusions: Ring chromosome results from breakage in both arms of a chromosome, with fusion of the points of fracture and loss of the distal fragments. In this context, aring induces chromosomal instability, which in turn generates a diversity of cell lines harboring different chromosome con ï¬gurations. In the case described here, we hypothesized that a 46,XX zygote acquired a r(15) leading to the instability subjacent to the other cell lines that had ring duplication, monosomy 15, trisomy 15, whichincluded r(15), most likely due to different approaches to restore balanced genome in the cells, such as trisomy rescue and UPD.

In males it is extremelyrare because nullisomy for X chromosome material is not compatible with survival and induce an early abortion. Only two cases of male with ring chromosome X andpresenting a short stature as the only phenotypic abnormality (Ogata et al. 1990 and Ellison et al. 2002) were previously reported. We report here a new case of atwo years old male with ring chromosome X characterized using Karyotype, FISH and 180K array ComparativeGenomic Hybridization and presenting a short stature and hypospadias, without dysmor phic features or any psycho motor developmental delay. Molecular investigations showed that ring X chromosome in this patient presents a terminal deletion of 923 Kb including SHOX gene and totally located on the pseud oautosomal region 1 (PAR1) and an inverted duplication of 2.3 Mb proximal to STS gene. The non loss of X chromosome material outside the PAR region explain the compatibility with survival in ourcase because the absence of functional nullisomy. Loss of SHOX gene is presumably common with the two pre viously reported cases and is the cause of short stature. However, hypospadias was not reported in the previous reported cases and may be due to the associated dupli cation outside PAR1 region and including particularlyPRKX gene coding for a protei n involved in urogenital system morphogenesis.

ROR2 muta tions exhibit autosomal recessive inheritance pattern whereas WNT5A, DVL1, DVL3 mutations segregate as autosomal dominant trait. Robinow syndrome is character ized by skeletal abnormalities encompass mesomelic or acromesomelic limb shortening, brachydactyly, distinctive facial features and genital hypoplasia. Materials and Methods: We diagnosed three cases (two of whom siblings) of Robinow syndrome with typical clinical features. All coding exons and the ï¬anking intronic regions of the ROR2 gene ampli ï¬ed by PCR and performed bidirectional direct sequencing. Variations were detected by comparing the reference sequences and interpreted by insilico predictive programs. Results: Two novel mutations [(c.1386 +1G>A), (c.784_785insCGAGGTGCTGGAGAGCG, p.

This syndrome is caused by compound heterozygosity in the gene RNU4A TAC, coding for the snRNA U4atac, which is an essential component for minor intron splicing. Material and Methods: Here we describe a female ï¬ve year old patient presenting with growth retardation,recurrent infections, organ anomalies and developmental delay. The patientÂ´s DNA was tested before by microarray analysis. No causative results could be detected. Due togenetic heterogeneity a trio analysis was performed on clinical exome sequencing using the Illumina TruSight One sequencing panel. The focus of our analysis lay on genesassociated with multiple congenital anomalies and / or developmental delay. Results and Conclusions: Compound heterozygosity of two SNVs could be detected in the gene RNU4ATAC . The paternally inherited substitution n.13C>T in the stem II region had been described previously, while the maternallyinherited substitution n.116A>C affecting a highly con served nucleotide in RNU4ATAC had not been described before.

Theparents were not available to establish the origin of the duplications. The extreme short stature of the girl might be the result of the co occurrence of growth hormone de ï¬ ciency and the rearrangements in the SHOX region.

Approximately 50% of the clinically diagnosed SRS patients present alterations at 11p15.5, mainly hypo methylation at H19/IGF2 :IG DMR, whereas 10% of them show UPD(7)mat. For the remaining 40% negative SRS patients, molecular karyotyping is advised. Materials and Methods: We present a 22 months old girl with clinical suspicion of SRS (IUGR, PNGR, prominent forehead, triangular face, psychomotor delay, transient neonatal hypoglycaemia, mild hypotonia and single umbi lical artery). She also presented corpus callosum hypoplasia, mild ventriculomegaly, Arnold Chiari malformation and high pitched voice. Methylation and CNVs at chromosomes11 and 7 were studied by MS MLPA (MRC Holland, ME030 C3 and ME032 A1, respectively). Molecular kar yotyping was performed (aCGH, Agilent 400K). Results: After no alterations were detected by MS MLPA at the analysed DMRs, the aCGH identi ï¬ed a deletion at 5p15.33p15.2 (arr[hg19] 5p15.33p15.2(25,942 11,644,645)x1). Deletions at 5p are commonly associated with Cri du chat syndrome (CdC). Conclusions: The absence of some CdC features in our patient could be due to the fact that their critical responsible regions are not included within the identi ï¬ed deletion. The common clinical aspects of CdC and SRS (impaired growth,developmental and intellectual delay) alongside the macro cephaly and the triangular face, typical of SRS, led to the initial clinical misinterpretation.

Data analysis was performed using DECIPHER (Wellcome Sanger Institute) and UCSC Genome Browser(University of California). Results: The cohort included 78 paediatric patients (39 females; 6 +/ 5,6 years) presenting intellectual disability with or without cranio facial dysmorphism, malformations or developmental. In some cases, karyotyping and ï¬uor escent in situ hybridization were used to identify chromo somal rearrangements. A pathogenic copy number variation was identi ï¬ed in 24,3%(19/78) of cases (microdeletion or microduplication syndromes) and 11.5% had possiblypathogenic or uncertain variants. The pathogenic copy number variants included 15 microdeletions (chromosomes 1,3,11,12,15,17,18 and X) and 4 microduplications (chro mosomes 15,13,16). The patogenic variants con ï¬rmed the syndromic phenotypes. For uncertain variants (all duplica tions chromosomes 1,5,21), parental SNPmicroarray testinghad been used to elucidate inheritance. Average size of deletion was 12,6Mb(range 1,1 40Mb).Uncertain variants had size range between 1 5,4Mb. CONCLUSSION Thediagnostic yield in our cohort was relatively good, however it included cases that were already diagnosed using karyotype and SNParray provided additional accuracyregarding size and genes involved in the copy number variant. Nonetheless, a good clinical selection is crucial for efï¬ciency of genetic testing. Unsolved cases require further molecular testing.

The major features are commonly include otologic, ophthalmic and dental malformations and midfacehypoplasia, micrognathia, microtia, conductive hearing loss and cleft palate can be seen. Treacher Collins Syndrome occurs with an incidence of 1 in 50000 live births. Pheno types caused by mutations in the gene POLR1D and POLR1C have similar clinical features with different inheritance patterns. Materials and Methods: A 32 years old man applied to our clinic with characteristic facial dysmorphism with bilateral and symmetrical hypoplasia of the malar bones. He had antimongoloid slant of the palpebral ï¬ssures, ear abnormalities and hearing loss. Both of his son were died because of the respiratory distress and they were both havemalar hypoplasia, malformation of auricle, hearing loss, downslanting palpebral ï¬ssures and partial absence of lower eyelashes. His father also has mild antimongoloid slant ofthe palpebral ï¬ssures. For mutation analysis, the coding region of TCOF1 gene was sequenced. Results: The molecular analysis showed the presence of heterozygous mutation, c.4394C>T / p. Ser1465Leu in exon 25 of the TCOF1 gene in the proband and his father.

There is only one report on a patient with TPT PS and Tetralogy of Fallot, however, harboring an additional 22q11.21 deletion. Here we presenta 3 month old girl with prenatally established double outlet right ventricle (DORV). Additionally, the patient had asymmetric preaxial, postaxial polydactyly with TPT PS(4 5 digits). Similar phenotype of upper and lower limbs was reported along ï¬ve generations in 9 affected family members with no history of congenital heart disease. Materials and Methods: The investigation was approved by the local ethical committee. Informed consent was obtained from patient's parents. Genetic analysis wasperformed using Sanger sequencing and array based comparative genomic hybridization (CGH array) with Agilent 60K platform. Results: Target sequencing of the TBX5 gene to exclude Holt Oram syndrome, NKX 2 5 , intron 5 of the LMBR1 did not reveal any known pathogenic variants/variants ofunknown signi ï¬cance.

To date, genetic basis of such phenotypes isonly partly characterized. In the present study, we report on a 30 year old woman with a clinical picture closely resembling ulnar mammary syndrome. The patient washospitalized due to frequent episodes of non sustained ventricular tachycardia and presented with symmetrical ï¬fth ï¬nger anomalies, mammary gland hypoplasia with inverted nipples, speci ï¬c face features, squint and abnormal teeth. Here we aimed to extend knowledge on molecular mechanisms underlying the complex congenital disorder. Materials and Methods: Genomic screening was carried out by whole exome sequencing (WES), Sanger sequencing and array based comparative genome hybridization. Results: No genetic defects were revealed in TBX3 ,t h e only gene associated with ul nar mammary syndrome to date, as well as in other genes responsible for commonheart hand syndromes. Based on WES data analysis, we took notice of a novel missense variant in SYNM gene (exon 1, p. A58V), encoding an intermediate ï¬lament protein synemin. Experi mental cell study con ï¬rmed high expression of synemin in mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) during tissue speci ï¬c differentiation, thus, point ing to a possible role of synemin in the congenital malformations. Conclusions: Here we present a nontypical clinical case of ulnar mammary syndrome with no association with TBX3 mutation.

However, the results were inconsistent. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between the C677T variant of the MTHFR gene, and susceptibility to acute leukemia in a cohort of Tunisian patients with AL. Materials and Methods: A case control study was conducted among 37 patients with AL and 35 controls.

In this study, we aimed to investigatewhether the essential oils of MC induce apoptosis on A549 cells, and if it is induced, which pathway leads the cells to apoptosis. Materials and Methods: A549 cells were exposed to various concentrations from 31.25 to 2500 Î¼g/ml of the essential oils. The cytotoxicity was measured by MTT assayand IC 50values were determined. Then, the essential oil was administered at the concentrations of 312.5 Î¼g/ml for 24 hours. The expression levels of caspase 3, 8 and 9, Bcl 2and P21 genes were evaluated by qRT PCR method. Results: Our results showed that 625 Î¼g/ml and above concentrations of the essential oils signi ï¬cantly suppressed cell viability. Expression levels of caspase 3 and 9 genes which are mediators of intrinsic pathway were signi ï¬cantly increased at a concentration of 312.5 Î¼g/ml of essential oils(p,0.0129 and p ,0.0180 respectively). However, when the expression levels of the caspase 8 gene, an important mediator of extrinsic apoptosis pathway, were comparedwith the control group, no difference was found. It was found that, the p21 and the anti apoptotic Bcl 2 genes were not different when compared with the control group. Conclusions: As a result, the essential oils of MC induce apoptosis through the intrinsic pathway.

Women with pathogenic mutations in either BRCA1 orBRCA2 have about ï¬ve times higher risk of breast cancer and ten to thirty times higher risk of ovarian cancer, but not all changes confer the same risks. While themost common genetic determinants are known, in high risk patients novel loss of function mutations can contribute a signiï¬cant risk. Materials and Methods: Screening of 806 samples over the 2016 2017 period has con ï¬rmed the prevalence of founder mutations: c.5266dupC, c.4035delA, c.181T>G,c.3700_3704delGTAAA and c.68_69delAG in BRCA1 (NM_007294.3). In cases lacking the above, full Next Generation Sequencing was performed using IonTorrent S5platform. The DNA library was prepared using AmpliSeq BRCA1/BRCA2 Panel (ThermoFisher Scienti ï¬c). The presence of pathogenic mutations was con ï¬rmed by Sanger sequencing on GA3500 (Applied Biosystems). Results: In one case, (63y.o. female with breast cancer and suspected ovarian cancer) a novel BRCA2:c.3215T>A(p. L1072*) mutation was detected. The likely loss of function follows due to heavily truncated protein product. Additionally, we detected several rare but previously described mutations with predicted deleterious impact. Conclusions: In high risk cases with negative screening results for common founder mutations, there is a strong cause for extended analysis of whole BRCA1/BRCA2 genes. Such an approach allows to detect new/atypicalunderlying changes in ca. 22% of affected patients. Routine sequencing of key oncogenes is thus validated as a tool of choice for informed therapies in breast/ovarian cancertreatment. K. Åacna: None. A. Bia Åek Pro ÅciÅska: None. M.

One must there fore explore alternative modes of genetic counseling andnovel approaches to testing, a task all the more challenging in France where only cancer geneticists (CG) have been prescribing genetic tests. Objectives . We are starting a pilot project involving CG, oncologists and breast/gynecological surgeons (O +OBGS) from a Paris University Hospital and its af ï¬liated suburban partner, and studying the feasibility and acceptability of a partnership allowing O +OBGS to prescribe genetic tests. Methods: All patients with breast/ovarian cancer will receive a family questionnaire. O +OBGS will evaluate whether testing is indicated using a modi ï¬ed Manchester Scoring System (MSS3). They will explain the principles ofgenetic susceptibility to cancer, give an explanatory lea ï¬et, obtain consent and prescribe BRCA1/2, PALB2 , and RAD51C/D analysis. CG will receive a medical report, the family questionnaire and a copy of the MSS3. If they suspect Li Fraumeni or think a multigene panel is indicated, they will ask to see the patient face to face. CG will returnall results during an individual consultation. Outcomes will be compared to patients seen exclusively by CG. Perspec tives . We will present preliminary observations at ESHG 2018. Our novel approach should allow us to cope withreferral increases, and free up time for consultations requiring real cancer genetics expertise. P. R. Benusiglio: D.

Mutations in the Bcr Abl kinase domain may cause, or contribute to, resistance to tyrosinekinase inhibitors (TKIs) in chronic myeloid leukemia patients. The aim of our study is to detect ï¬ve common mutations (T315I, F359V, E255V, E255K, Y253H) in theABL1 kinase domain (harboring on acquired) in patients with CML. Materials and Methods: The study was performed on 30 patients with CML. We used Allele speci ï¬c ampli ï¬cation to detect the mutations in the ABL1 kinase domain. Results: In our study T315I mutation was detected in one patient and in the same patient E255K mutation was present as well. We did not detect E255V, F359V and Y253H mutations in the patients. The patient is a 79 years old male,diagnosed in CML chronic phase in April 2017. The patient was treated with Nilotinib, followed by Dasatinib. Not even hematological response has been achieved so far. Conclusions: The patient with mutations in ABL kinase domain showed treatment failure based on 2013 ELN recommendations for management of CML. One of thestudy limitations was limited number of samples. Research on larger number of patients is suggested to obtain more reliable results. Identi ï¬cation of ABL kinase domain mutations may be used as a proper and useful method for improving therapeutic strategies, avoiding delay inAbstracts from the 51stEuropean Society of Human Genetics Conference: â¦ 1013treatment and excessive expenditure in CML patients with tyrosine kinase inhibitors resistance.

Precisely how metabolism becomesreprogrammed in cancer cells, whose functions or malig nant properties are enabled by these activities, help to exploit metabolic changes for suitable therapeutic bene ï¬t. On the other hand, reprogrammed metabolism refers to the ability of cancer cells supporting the increased energy request due to continuous growth, rapid proliferation, andother characteristics typical of neoplastic cells. FNDC5/ Irisin, a novel hormone in the regulation of energy balance, is involved in metabolic homeostasis. Energy imbalancewere shown to be associated with colorectal cancer. Therefore, FNDC5 expression level was assessed in two colorectal cancer cell lines i.e. Caco 2, HT29 and humanï¬broblast as a control group by quantitative real time PCR. Our results indicated that FNDC5 expression level is increased signi ï¬cantly in HT29 colorectal cancer cell line compare to Caco 2 colorectal cancer cell line and control group.

These genes localized the common region of deletion to the distal long1014 J. del Picchiaarm, 19q13.2 13.4. EML2 is one of the tumor suppressor genes that is situated on 19q13.32. Also, this loci can be considerably methylated in GBMs by CpG island promoter hypermethylation. Interestingly, miR 330 encoding gene is lies inside the intron of EML2, and this miRNA also acts as oncosuppressor miR in glioblastomas. Importantly, miR 519d encoding gene which is situated on 19q13.42 also downregulated in GBMs. Moreover, NOP53 (also desig nated GLTSCR2/PICT 1) is localized within the dis tinguished 1.4 Mb tumor suppressive region of chromosome 19q13.33. Additionally, Bcl2L12, a protein belonging to the Bcl 2 protein family which is located on19q13.33, is upregulated in glioblastoma multiform (GBM) and plays a role in tumor cell development and tumor cell resistance to apoptosis. Our hypothesis is that a program mable CRISPR/AsCpf1 based genome engineering strategy can be used to attach these sizeable chromosomal fragments of tumor suppressor genes as an essential part of the chro mosome 19 q arm with the aim of chromosomal treatment.

Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), classi ï¬ed as World Health Organization (WHO) grade IV in ï¬ltrative glioma, is the most common primary brain tumor in adults and the most lethal subtype of gliomas. The molecular hetero geneity in gliomas is extremely complex. There are several genes involved in critical signaling pathways like receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK), p53 pathway and retinoblastoma(RB) pathway. Somatic copy number variations in these genes are supposed to contribute to the glioblastomadevelopment and prognosis. In the present study, we examined the presence of genetic aberrations in a small group of Bulgarian patients. Materials and Methods: Fresh brain biopsy tissues were analyzed with multiplex ligation dependent probe ampli ï¬cation (MLPA). Results: Simultaneous genetic alterations were found: EGFR (epidermal growth factor receptor) ampli ï¬cation, CDKN2A (cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor 2A) deletionand TP53 (tumor protein p53) deletion.

On the other hand, biallelic germline mutations in one of these MMR genes are responsible for the Constitutional Mis match Repair De ï¬ciency (CMMRD) syndrome character ized by an early onset CRC with a high childhood cancer risk. We present a very early onset CRC in a 12 year old boy belonging to a LS family with a germline pathogenic variant in the MSH2 gene. His CRC showed MSH2/MSH6 protein complex loss, microsatellite instability, and the second hit mutation in MSH2 . Due to his early onset a CMMRD was suspected, but the absence of another detected germline alteration in the MMR genes together with the resultsobtained in the gMSI /(ev)MSI and the methylation tolerance assays 1discarded the CMMRD diagnosis. Our hypothesis is that another germline variant occurring in the affected child could contribute in addition with the causative MSH2 variant to his early onset CRC. Whole exome sequencing and trio analysis were carried out. Preliminary results showed no genetic alterations in actionable genes related to hereditary colorectal cancer syndromes or in genes involved in DNA repair pathways(NER, BER, HR). Further analyses are still undertaking. These data support the existence of a severe and early onset LS phenotype mimicking CMMRD. Although thegenetic mechanisms underlying this clinical continuum are largely unknown, we will discuss possible scenarios of a postulated genetic continuum. 1Bodo _Gastroenterology 2015 Funding: CNAG 300 exomes Rare Diseases M.

Results: In two cases, the copy number gains (dup15q11.2q11.3 and dup15q11.2) were caused by inter stitial duplication detected by FISH analyses.

Clinical case: We report here a case of a mosaic 47, XXY/46,XX infertile male in whom referred to our department with infertility history for 5 years. His sperm analysis revealed azoospermia. The cytogenetic analysiswith GTG banding karyotype lymphocytes from peripheral blood samples showed 47,XXY[57]/46,XX[43]. Also FISH analysis with X centromere probe con ï¬rmed the mosaicism. Conclusion: We have demonstrated 47,XXY/46,XX mosaicism of Klinefelter syndrome which is extremely rare genetic disease and therefore we thought to contribute to theliterature with the present study.

Despite a wide variety of available data, speci ï¬c biological processes underlying abnormal neurodevelopment remain to be unmasked. Here, we have used molecular cytogenetic data to analyze speci ï¬c pathways leading to neuropsychiatric diseases in children. Materials and Methods: Conventional and molecular karyotyping was used to evaluate 427 patients with idiopathic intellectual disability, autism, epilepsy, andcongenital malformations. An original bioinformatic tech nique based on candidate process prioritization (Iourov et al., 2014; Yurov et al., 2017) was applied to pathwayenrichment among these patients. Results: Molecular cytogenetic analysis has shown CNVs relevant to a pathway functional change in 397children (93%). The highest enrichment rates (gene percentage among all the prioritized candidate genes/ processes) were found for the following pathways: cellcycle (4.68%), MAPK signaling (6.56%), pathways in cancer (11.94%), DNA replication (1.64%). All the children exhibiting the genomic variations altering genes involved inthese pathways were found to present with chromosome instability (mosaic aneuploidy, chromosome breaks/fragi lity, non speci ï¬c structural chromosomal rearrangements), whereas the remainder was not demonstrating de ï¬nable chromosome instability. Conclusions: Alterations to pathways associated with genome/chromosome stability maintenance through the cell cycle were shown to be involved in the pathogenesis of neuropsychiatric diseases. The consequences of the altera tions were found to be detectable at chromosomal level. These data supports a previously proposed hypothesis describing two /multiple hits to genome stability as apossible mechanism of neuropsychiatric diseases (Iourov et al., 2013).

Due to the clinical and genetic heterogeneity of diseases, molecular diagnosiscan be very challenging. Whole exome sequencing (WES) have revolutionized the ï¬eld of genomics by allowing a rapid and cost effective diagnosis. Here, we present data on the ï¬rst 172 probands referred to us for genetic evaluation by WES. Patients presented with a range of phenotypes suggesting potential genetic causes. The molecular diagnostic rate observed in our study is 43%. This yield is higher than the positive rates of other genetic tests, such as karyotype analysis (5 to 15%), chromosomal microarray analysis (15 to 20%), and Sanger sequencing for single genes. WES provided a high diagnosis in people with deafness, renal dysfunction, leukodystrophies and neuromuscular disorders; suggesting that these groups of patients areparticularly good candidates for genetic evaluation by WES. Undiagnosed cases may present large rearrangements or mutations that are located in non coding regions, such asregulatory or deep intronic regions, which can not be detected by WES. Furthermore, technical limitations such as poor coverage can also interfere with WES success. In conclusion, the use of WES to analyze 172 clinical cases yielded a diagnosis in 43% of these cases, which supports the use of WES as a diagnostic test for patientswith nonspeci ï¬c or unusual disease presentations of possible genetic cause and for patients with clinical diagnoses of heterogeneous genetic conditions.

Materials and Methods: We obtained 3 iPSC lines from ï¬broblasts of patient with r(13) by using LeGO lentiviral vectors, coding OCT4, SOX2, KLF4 and C MYC tran scription factors. Cytogenetic analysis was performed using G banding and FISH. Results: Fibroblasts were mosaic for variable level of r (13), monosomy 13 and 46,XY, 13, +mar cells during cultivation. iTAF6 6 iPSC line karyotype was 46,XY,r(13) in 80% and 45,XY, 13 in 20% of cells at passage 13 (P13).iTAF6 13 line had 95% of 46,XY, 13, +mar cells at P11, whereas the ring chromosome was not registered at all. Perhaps, this clone originated from a cell with the markerchromosome or fragmentation of r(13) took place during reprogramming or at early passages. In iTAF6 4 line the proportion of cells with r(13) signi ï¬cantly decreased from 18% to 5%, at the same time the proportion of cells with marker chromosome signi ï¬cantly increased from 73% to 86% (at P5 and P12 respectively) with a small number ofmonosomic cells.

Materials and Methods: In the present study, chromo somal damage was assessed using the Buccal MicronucleusCytome (BMCyt) assay as a function of radiation exposure after Institutional Ethics Committee clearance of the study and written voluntary informed consent from the partici pants. For this, 24 hour personal exposimeter measurements (PEM) were recorded for unrelated 60 healthy adults (40 cases residing in the vicinity of mobile phone base stationssince their installation and 20 controls residing in areas with no base stations). Results: The PEM in cases (149.28Â±8.98 mV/m) revealed signi ï¬cantly higher (p ,0.000) electric ï¬eld strength compared to the recorded value (80.40Â±0.30 mV/ m) in controls.

In order to assess the effects of diet and stress on TL, and minimise the effect of age, the current study assessed school age children with acomprehensive phenotyping approach. Materials and Methods: Relative telomere length ratios were determined in 375 subjects (age 9 14 years). Subjectswere recruited within the ACFIES (Association between Cardiorespiratory Fitness, Muscular Strength and Body Composition with Metabolic Risk Factors in ColombianChildren) study. Phenotypes were determined using stan dard tests and an extensive questionnaire. A composite stress score was derived by adding together the number ofserious life events for each subject. Statistical analysis was carried out using SPSSv25 (IBM Inc., USA). Results: Consumption of 31 different foods was not signiï¬cantly associated with TL (p>0.05). Uncorrected associations were observed for dairy (p ,0.014), fast food (p,0.01) and fruit juice (p ,0.049). Household income was positively associated with consumption of dairy (p , 0.00005) and fruit juice (p ,0.03) but not fast food (p>0.05). It was negatively associated with a compositestress score (p ,0.00003). In this study, neither household income nor stress were associated with TL (p>0.05). Conclusions: Interestingly, TL appears to be positively associated with consumption of dairy products, possibly due to the bene ï¬cial effects of increasing micronutrients such as calcium in the diet for these children. The lack ofassociation with household income and stress may be due to the relatively small cohort size, or their young age so that long term effects are yet to manifest. E. D. Kidd: None. A.

Pro ï¬ling was made with the help of Affymetrix GeneChip 2.0. Data were normalized by SSTR Multi Chip Analysis algorithm in TAC 4.0. The changes of MCM4 RNA levels were determined through different time after siRNA transfection. Control cells were transfected with siCON1. A comparative analysis of siMCM4/siCON1 RNA samples showed thatMCM4 gene silencing leads to changes in 146 genes (gene level p value < 0,05). The most of identi ï¬ed genes are involved into regulation of cell cycle process, G1/S transi tion, DNA replication, anatomical structure development. In particular, the expression of E2F7, Cdc6, CCNE2 cell cycle genes were suppressed and expression of CDK8 gene was increased. The CDK8 is a part of mediator complex that allowed suggest activation of multiple transcription pro grams as response to gene silencing. Of signi ï¬cance is the increased expression of TNFSF10 gene, which activates cancer cell death through the extrinsic apoptotic pathway.

We reported two unrelated male probands: the ï¬rst affected by OSCS (his mother present mild phenotype) and a second with familial Wilms tumor. Whole exome sequencing (WES) of both revealed two novel missense germinal mutations: c.401>G/T (OSCS) and c.477T>G (Wilms);additionally, WES on tumor tissue revealed a second hit in CTNNB1 gene. Both germline mutations in males were found with a minor allele frequency <1% in Caucasianpopulation. The histidine at 134 and the phenylalanine at 159 position in WTX were conserved in phylogenetic tree, thus suggesting a causative role. These variants are locatedin exon2 encoding an important Phosphatidylinositol(4,5) bisphosphate binding domain to localize WTX to the plasma membrane. Most deleterious mutations in thisdomain correlate with fetal or neonatal lethality in affected males. We hypothesized that c.401G>T mutation is responsible of the âmildâmale phenotype of OCSC, prob ably because of the change of a basic on hydrophobic amino acid (p.

More than 15% of men older than 70 show some degree of LOY and these men survive on average only half as long as men without LOY. But how is LOY measured today and whatwould be the best method for the future? Genome wide arrays are most commonly used in LOY studies, but other methods have also been used: wholegenome sequencing (WGS), gene targeted qPCR or droplet digital PCR (ddPCR). We have compared and evaluated arrays, WGS and ddPCR targeting a homologous genelocated on the X and Y chromosome for LOY studies. The cheap and easy ddPCR method gives very similar results as the expensive and precise WGS, when using whole bloodfor detecting LOY. However, the sensitivity of all these methods are limited, leaving low frequencies of LOY undetected. These methodsrequire high amounts of DNA input from hundreds of thousands of cells, but LOY is a binary event on the singlecell level. The clonal expansion of rare LOY cells could have important clinical implications. Therefore, we aim to combine LOY and cell type detection in a clinically applicable single cell assay.

The study âs objective was to compare nucleic acids extraction (NAE) to direct punches ampli ï¬cation (DPA) processed by the CPA200. Methods: For this study, 10 bloods and BS, were used to standardize the procedure and 35 specimens to validate it. Samples were tested by NAE, and punches, processed by the CPA200 from blood on NCW and BS on NCC, byDPA. Nucleic acid was extracted from blood and BS with the QIAamp Â®DNA Mini Kit; punches were washed with 200ul sterile water and dried. Extracts and punches wereampli ï¬ed with in house PCR assays using primers speci ï¬c for 14 clotting factors (apo e, AGT, FGB, factorV Y, FACTOR II, FACTOR V LEIDEN, MTHFR677,MTHFR1298, FACTOR V CAMBRIGE, ACE, HPA, PAI, FACTOR XIII, APOB) followed by mini sequencing reaction and EC on 3500 ABI System. Results: In the 10 blood and BS all 14 markers were detected using NAE and DPA. In the 35 bloods tested only for FACTOR II, FACTOR V LEIDEN, MTHFR677 andMTHFR1298, were detected by both methods with 100% results correlation. Conclusions: Data obtained in this study demonstrated that direct punches ampli ï¬cation can detect all 14 clotting markers from NCW punches of blood on NCW and of BS on NCC. The NUCLEIC CARD â¢and CPA200 â¢in combination with direct punches ampli ï¬cation are facilitat ing specimens testing work ï¬ow for bleeding disorders. G. Paselli: None. E",2018

We tested cholesterol markers to make the best prediction model based on our DTC service (GeneStyleTM) results. In this study, we describe the testing results from 647 samples. The customers agreed the written con ï¬rmed and we col lected the buccal swab DNA samples and disease history questionnaire. Among the DTC genes, we examined cho lesterol gene markers ( SORT1,HMGCR,ABO,ABCA1, MYL2,LIPG,CETP ) and self reported hyperlipidemia his tory with controlling age, sex, smoking, alcohol drinking,family history as the covariates. The single marker asso ciation with hyperlipidemia history did not show any association tendencies. Therefore, we combined the sevengene marker genotypes and calculated the genetic risk scores(GRS) based on the number of risk allele and the multiple regression effects size to hyperlipidemia. Interest ingly, the combined index of the GRS was signi ï¬cantly associated with the questionnaire cholesterol history (OR 2.492 (95% CI 1.179 5.266), P,0.017). Using this GRS, we estimated the risk prediction accuracy by ROC curve, and the area under cover was 58.8%. Because the most of the DTC markers were studied for the quantitative traits, thepredictive power might be weakening. Conclusively, the DTC service genes are well selected by the Korean gov ernments, and the companies should improve the predictionaccuracy based on the practical tests.

The association between metals and neurodegenerative diseases is under constant investigation, for their involve ment in oxidative stress and their potential role as bio markers of these pathologies. Redox active metals, like vanadium (V), undergo redox cycling reactions in cells and can produce reactive oxygen species (ROS) in biologicalsystems (Valko et al., 2005).Abstracts from the 51stEuropean Society of Human Genetics Conference: â¦ 1027Materials and Methods: The whole blood of 20 SCA2 patients and of 18 healthy individuals was subjected to V quanti ï¬cation by inductively coupled plasma mass spectro metry (ICP MS). Results: Vanadium concentrations were signi ï¬cantly higher (p< 0.05) in patients (6.5 Â±1.0 micrograms L 1) compared to controls (3.7 Â± 0.8 micrograms L 1). Conclusions: Neurodegenerative processes have been related to metal imbalances, with altered levels of differentelements in serum or blood samples. V species and, in particular, the oxido vanadium cation VO( 2+) have been previously reported to be involved in the annihilation andformation of reactive oxygen species (Rehder, 2013). The presence of higher levels of V in cells of SCA2 patients may lead to the increase of ROS, and probably to the upregulation of the antioxidant enzymes system to counteract the oxidative stress. In fact, the presence of oxidative stress and a signi ï¬cant increase of superoxide dismutase (SOD1 and SOD2) in SCA2 has been extensively documented (Guevara Garcia et al., 2012; Cornelius et al., 2017). We suggest that vanadium level in the blood of SCA2 patientsis of special interest as potential biomarkers of this disease. S. Squadrone: None. M. C. Abete: None. P. Brizio: None. C. Mancini: None.

Despite of studies for examining the mechanism associated with HLA, the association betweenAED induced SCARs and HLA alleles is still unclear. We investigated HLA B alleles in AED induced SCARs. Material and Methods: Six AED induced SCAR patients were requested for evaluating the causality. Four patients of them were treated with carbamazepine due to pain control. One of the rest was treated with phenytoin, and the other was treated with valproic acid for seizure prevention after cranial haemorrhage operation. All recovered from SCARs after stopping AED treatment and intensive care. HLA B alleles were performed using PCR sequence based typing method and lymphocyte activation test (LAT) was con ducted for con ï¬rming the culprit drug of the SCARs. Results: Demographic ï¬ndings (gender, age), culprit AEDs, and HLA B alleles of the 6 patients listed in Table 1.LAT results were positive for the culprit drugs except one (F/59). Expression of HLA B*51:01 and HLA B*15:11 alleles were detected in three (50.0%) and two (33.3%),respectively. Two patients had homozygous HLA B*55:01 andHLA B*15:11/*55:01 alleles, respectively. Conclusions: The result suggests that Korean individuals with the HLA B*51:01 allele, 8.35% in general population, may be susceptible to AED induced SCARs.

The advent of next generation sequencing (NGS) has enabled the development of expan ded carrier screening tests that analyze multiple genessimultaneously, allowing the consideration of alternative reproductive options and early intervention strategies. Here we describe the bioinformatic analysis of an expanded carrier screening panel for 688 autosomal and X linked recessive disorders. Material and Methods: DNA was extracted from 120 blood samples. NGS of targeted exons of 483 genes was performed on a Nextseq 550 and sequence data analysis was achieved using an in house bioinformatic pipeline. Brieï¬y, data was demultiplexed, converted to Fastq format and low quality data was removed. Reads were aligned against the reference genome hg19 using Burrows Wheeler Aligner and Genome Analysis Toolkit was used to call variants. Then, variants were annotated and coverage and functional impact ï¬lters were applied using a custom made script. Filtered variants were classi ï¬ed according to ACMG guidelines. Results: A mean of 4742 raw variants per sample were found. After ï¬ltering, a mean of 355 variants were detected and after variant classi ï¬cation 83 pathogenic/likely patho genic variants (0.7 per sample) were identi ï¬ed. About one third of the patients were carriers of at least one pathogenic/ likely pathogenic variant. Conclusions: Local development of a bioinformatic pipeline has allowed our laboratory to set up an NGS based expanded carrier screening test, which could potentially help identify couples at risk and reduce theincidence of severe recessive disorders.

The rhAmp SNP assayprimers contain a single RNA base and are 3 âend blocked. In addition, the allele speci ï¬c primers have a non target complimentary tail. Rapid de blocking of the primers by theenzyme RNase H2 only occurs upon hybridization to the perfectly matched target. Once deblocked by RNase H2, the SNP site is then interrogated by a novel DNA polymerasewith enhanced allelic discriminating abilities. Upon recog nition of the correct base pairing, extension by the modi ï¬ed polymerase occurs from the perfect match primer.

Thesedata contain personal information, so secure storage and access has high priority, also due to new European legis lation. To face these challenges, we have developed a web based Laboratory Information Management System (LIMS) optimized for multi project laboratories. Results: LIMS is designed as 3 layer web application, which enhances security and restricts accessibility to potential attackers. Additional computational cluster pro vides bioinformatic analyses over anonymized genomicdata without personal identi ï¬ers. Summary analysis reports are immutable to change, but with the possibility of repeated reanalysis in case of upgrades of computationalpipelines. One instance of LIMS can be used to manage several independent projects, with ability to assign user roles foreach project separately. This restricts user to access only those projects, samples and analysis, which they are assigned to. Thus, we can collect a large genomic data setsin a single system, which allows to perform wide scale population studies that are based on aggregation analyses over large cohort of individuals. LIMS has mechanism to de ï¬ne genealogy relationships between samples, which is utilized in genetics analyses of families' anamneses. Implementation of suggested diseasesbased on phenotypes terms from HPO database may further assist physicians in decision process.

Materials and Methods: FGENESH and Promoter Scan were used to the coding sequence and promoter analysis respectively. The encoded protein analyzed by ProtParamand ProtScale and hydrophobicity was assessed by the same ProtScale. Domains were analyzed by CD search and InterProScan and possible post translational modi ï¬cations got evaluated by ScanProsite. Results: The coding sequence, 759 bp, is located in 45 to 2961 nucleotides. Promoter sequence starts from 824 till877. Transcription start site is nucleotide number 868 and its distance from ATG is 132bp. The encoded protein is made up 231 acid amines.

In addition to commonly used analyses of associations between genomic variations and phenotypes, it appears that investigating candidate disease processes by network based classi ï¬cation according to genomic data represents an intriguing alternative. Materials and Methods: Genome wide CNV scan was performed in 545 individuals with neurodevelopmental pathology using array CGH and SNP array techniques. Network based classi ï¬cation of probable functional con sequences of genomic rearrangements was done according to a previously described protocol (Yurov et al., 2017) based on the fusion of genomic, epigenomic, proteomic/interactomic and metabolomic data. Results: We found that the variomes (set of all CNVs in an individual genome) of individuals with neurodevelop mental pathology are enriched in DNA replication, DNA damage/repair, nucleotide excision/mismatch repair, ATM pathway (DNA damage ATM p53 apoptosis pathway) aswell as p53 , MAPK , ErbB , PI3KAkt signaling pathways. Additionally, we found enrichment for pathway clusters or combinations (e.g. MAPK signaling with axonal guidance; DNA damage ATM p53 apoptosis with phagosome and gap junction; p53 signaling with RNA transport and pathways in cancer etc.). There were 12 distinct pathway/process clusters and 14 distinct pathway/process combina tions which were further used for classi ï¬cation of neurodevelopmental pathology. Conclusions: Network based classi ï¬cation of neurode velopmental pathology according to cytogenomic data appears to be an ef ï¬cient approach to determine candidate processes for neurodevelopmental diseases.

Using appropriate bioinformatics tools and public databases which aggregate clinical information, it is possible to understandthe functional impact of such variants on human phenotypic traits. Several bioinformatics tools already exist, however with limitations such as, the license costs and the limitedchoice of public databases consulted. Therefore, our aim was to implement an in house tool that aggregates infor mation collected from selected public databases, allowingthe custom annotation of genomic variants and their clas siï¬cation in terms of pathogenicity. Materials and Methods: We implemented a tool, Annotator, which annotates and classi ï¬es genomic variants using data from 5 renowned public databases (Uniprot, OMIM, ClinVar, dbSNP, Pubmed). Annotator can alsointegrate keywords, de ï¬ned according to sample character istics, for advanced data/text mining, in order to further select collected data to best suit the clinical features of thesample under analysis. Results: Annotator was used to analyze and classify a set of 151 genomic variants, detected in 52 probands withFamilial Intestinal Gastric Cancer. These genomic variants had already been analyzed/classi ï¬ed using a commercial software. The comparison of the results obtained with bothanalyses showed that Annotator was able to collect further information for 7/42 somatic variants and 4/24 germline variants, which were classi ï¬ed as of unknown signi ï¬cance for the commercial software. Conclusion: Annotator is a valid tool for an accurate annotation and ef ï¬cient classi ï¬cation of genomic variants derived from sequencing experiments.

However, mechanism still needs to be elucidated. Thus, we aimed to explore theapoptosis regulating miRNA expressions for apoptotic effects of garlic extract on A549 cells. Methods: A549 cells were incubated with fresh garlic extract for 24 h. Total RNAs were extracted from cell cultures with cell count of 1x10E5 in 6 well plates. 10 miRNAs regulation apoptosis were selected (miR 21_2,miR 31_1, miR 39_1, miR 133a_2, miR 143_1, miR 146a_1, miR 155_2, miR 183_2, miR 210_1 and miR 222_2) and expressions were analyzed by real time PCR(RotorGene Q, Qiagen). Results: Fresh garlic extract treated A549 cells repre sented decreased expressions of miR 146a_1 (3,47 Folddecrease) as the apoptosis increased. However, proapoptotic miR143 expressions were also downregulated. Discussion/Conclusion: Our study was the ï¬rst to link the apoptosis of lung carcinoma cell lines with miRNA expressions in A549 cell line, up to the literature.

Total RNAs were extracted and 10 miRNAs expressions were analyzed by real time PCR (RotorGene Q, Qiagen). Results: The optimum apoptotic affects were achieved at concentrations of 0,625 Î¼g/mL. Propolis extract treated A549 cells showed gradually increased expressions of miR 133a_2 and miR 143_1, and gradually decreased expres sions of miR 21_2, miR 146a_1, miR 155_2 and miR 183_2 by increased dosages of 0,125 Î¼g/mL to 0,625 Î¼g/mL compared to non treated tumor cells . Conclusion: In our study, we for the ï¬rst time represented the downregulation of apoptosis regulatingmiRNAs in lung cancer cell lines (A549) after treatment of propolis extract, up to the literature. Hence, they may be a role for propolis to induce apoptosis (as its anti tumorigenicaffect) through epigenetic changes on Fas and FasL with/ without PTEN on the etrinsic pathway of programmed cell death.

The aim of this case control associationstudy was to investigate prevalence of risk alleles of MCT1 rs1049434, COL1A1 rs1800012, COL3A1 rs1800255 in Lithuanian professional football players. Methods: A total of 150 footballers (Caucasian male) and 150 controls (sedentary, healthy male) were genotyped using TaqMan RT PCR assay. Results: The genotype distribution were in HWE for all groups (P>0.05). There were no differences in genotype/ alleles frequency for COL1A1 rs1800012 and COL3A1 rs1800255 between the footballers and control groups. The odds ratio (OR) of athlete harboring COL3A1 AA genotypes (the risk allele A) compared to control was0.29 (95%CI: 0.08 0.89, p ,0.04). Signi ï¬cant MCT1 genotype distribution were determined between the foot ballers and controls (TT/TA/AA: 45.3/44.7/10% vs 34.0/47.3/18.7%; p ,0.04). The proportion of MCT1 risk allele A, observed in controls (42.3%) was larger than in all footballers (32.3%, p ,0.07), speci ï¬cally, than in mid ï¬elders (26.7%; p ,0.04). The OR of MCT1 TT genotype and being a football player was 1.61 (95%CI 1.012 2.574, p,0.045), while the OR of MCT1 AA genotype was 0.48 (95%CI 0.242 0.937, p ,0.035). Conclusions: MCT1 rs1049434 (T allele) associated with football performance. Carrying the MCT1 TT genotype may be protective against sport related injury. The MCT1 AA andCOL3A1 AA genotypes may in ï¬uence increased risk of injury. Replication studies are needed to support our dataand to fully understand the relationship between predis position to injuries in football. V. Gineviciene: None. A. Jakaitiene: None. I.

The comorbidity between two phenotypes canbe explained by shared genetic variants predisposing to both diseases. One of the features of the clinical course of bronchial asthma (BA) is its signi ï¬cant comorbidity with cardiovascular pathology. According to epidemiological data, BA has a decisive in ï¬uence on the subsequent risk of cardiovascular disease. Therefore, hypertension and BA canbe considered as an example of common comorbid diseases. From the point of view of genetics, these two diseases are well studied and many genes for BA and hypertension wereidenti ï¬ed. We assume that their comorbidity is based on shared pathophysiological changes for both BA and hypertension associated with genes involved in the regula tion of immune system, smooth muscle tone and vascular remodeling. We set out to elaborate this hypothesis and identify genes of this comorbidity. We prioritized genesusing several criteria based on gene network analysis describing mechanisms of BA and hypertension comor bidity. The top list of candidate genes that can be involvedin convergent pathophysiological mechanisms leading to comorbidity of BA and hypertension include TLR4, CAT, IL10, CST3, ICAM1, IRF6, AKT1, NFKB1, PNP, SELL,CCL5, IL2RB, IDS, FOS, NT5C2 , and BHLHE40 . We also identi ï¬ed 96 eQTL SNPs for these genes and study them to validate our hypothesis in cohorts of patients with BA,hypertension and individuals affected by both the diseases.

High fre quency of GJB2 caused deafness in some populations is suggested by combined effects of assortative mating tradi tion among deaf people based on linguistic homogamy (sighlanguage) and relaxed selection against deafness (Nance et al., 2000). We previously revealed GJB2 caused deafness proportion in some indigenous Siberian populations: 15.1%in Tuvinians (Republic Tuva), 17.5% in Altaians (Republic Altai), 53.0% in Yakuts (Republic Sakha/Yakutia) while sufï¬cient number of familial deafness cases remained undiagnosed. This study presents the results of comparative analysis of the survey data (marriage patterns, fertility, communication mode, social interactions) of deaf indivi duals from these Siberian regions. Assortative marriage rates were 64.5% (Tuva), 72.9% (Altai), with signi ï¬cant differences (p<0.05) between urban and rural residents 70.9% vs 57.7% (Tuva), 91.9% vs 58.3% (Altai), and 77.1% (Yakutia, urban residents).

The presentstudy was designed to assess whether BMI or blood glucose is associated with TL in school age children of South American origin. Materials and Methods: Relative telomere length ratios were determined in 375 subjects (age 9 14 years). Subjects were recruited within the ACFIES (Association betweenCardiorespiratory Fitness, Muscular Strength and Body Composition with Metabolic Risk Factors in Colombian Children) study. Phenotypes were determined using stan dard tests and an extensive questionnaire. Statistical analysis was carried out using SPSSv25 (IBM Inc., USA). Results: Partial correlation analysis, controlling for the effects of age, gender, PCR plate and BMI demonstrates a robust negative correlation between TL and blood glucose (r, 0.14, p ,0.008). Using a univariate linear model analytical approach, blood glucose is also signi ï¬cantly associated with telomere length (p ,0.011) with the same variables in the model. No signi ï¬cant association with BMI was detected. Conclusions: TL is a potential biomarker: blood glucose is negatively associated with TL in this cohort ofColombian schoolchildren and this effect does not appear to be related to obesity. The lack of association with BMI may be due to the difference in ethnicity or becauseprevious studies have had higher than normal proportions of children with early onset obesity.

The prevalence of CFTR mutations differs among various ethnic, demographic, and racial groups. Peculiar distribution of CFTR mutations in Osse tians was studied. The Republic of North Ossetia âAlania, a part of the North Caucasus Federal region of RF, is located on the Northern slope of the Greater Caucasus. The popu lation is about 700,000 people. Ossetians make 64,5% of the population of North Ossetia. Materials and Methods: DNA of 6 Ossetian CF patients from the Republic of North Ossetia âAlania was analyzed for 33 common CFTR mutations and sequencing. DNA of 108 healthy Ossetians without CF family history was testedfor 13 CFTR mutations (CFTRdele2,3(21kb), F508del, I507del, 1677delTA, 2143delT, 2183AA>G, 2184insA, 394delTT, 3821delT, L138ins, W1282X, E92K). Results: Three CF patients were relatives: two ï¬rst siblings and one second sibling. They had the same genotype, F508del/W1282X. The genotypes of three otherunrelated CF patients were W1282X/W1282X, W1282X/ 2184insA, 2184del4/1248 +1G>A. One heterozygous car rier of W1282X mutation was detected in 108 healthyOssetians.

Mild forms of preeclampsia generally do not possess any symptoms, whereas the severe forms may cause headaches, renalinsufï¬ciency and even fetal and maternal death. The inci dence of pre eclampsia varies between 2% to 10% of pregnancies globally. However, WHO reported that this rateis reported to be almost seven times more in the developing countries. Therefore, this study aims to investigate the knowledge, screening methods and the incidence of pre eclampsia in North Cyprus. Materials and Methods: Questionnaire based survey were conducted to women at least 18 years of age. Thematernal variables including age, possible gestational age and previous pregnancy associated complications were collected from all the volunteers. The social economic andeducational status of the women were taken into considera tion for this analysis. The knowledge and awareness of pre eclampsia associated risks and complications wereevaluated. Results: The overall awareness of pre eclampsia was 53% and 39% had experienced pre eclampsia themselves. Due to the lack of knowledge on the complications, women with pre eclampsia speci ï¬ed that they experienced sub stantial panic and stress upon diagnosed. The awarenesswas associated with the level of education. However, generally the women were not aware of the maternal/fetal mortality risk or any possibilities with the geneticpredispositions. Conclusion: Lack of awareness translates to worse health outcomes, including fetal and maternal death or pre termbirths.

Here we report, for the ï¬rst time, rates of pathogenic variation in hereditary cancer genes across thousands of healthy elderly individuals, ascertained with out reference to clinical phenotype or family history, enrolled in an aspirin primary prevention trial. Materials and Methods : Individuals enrolled in the ASPirin in Reducing Events in the Elderly (ASPREE) Healthy Ageing Biobank were screened using a 760 gene âsuper panel âincluding pan cancer gene coverage. The average age was 75 years (min 65 years, max. 98 years), and all participants were con ï¬rmed to be free of life threatening cancer diagnoses, cardiovascular disease orcognitive decline at time of enrolment. Medical records, family history and clinical data were mined for evidence of cancer phenotypes in mutation carriers. Results : We detected hundreds of pathogenic and high conï¬dence predicted deleterious mutations in hereditary cancer genes in elderly individuals (>10,000 samplessequenced Feb 2018). Mutations were often detected in the absence of any reported disease phenotype or family history. Overall, pathogenic variants were found at acomparable rate to population based cohorts, suggesting over representation of non penetrant individuals in this study. Conclusions : Pathogenic germline mutations in cancer predisposition genes may exist more commonly in the population than expected, raising questions about clinicalactionability, risk and penetrance.

Although most are thought to disrupt gene function by disrupting regulatory elements such as enhancers, it is stilllargely unknown which noncoding regions constitute true enhancers, nor which genes each enhancer in ï¬uences. To empirically address this, we have developed CRISPR QTLmapping, a framework in which large numbers of noncod ing perturbations are introduced to each cell on an isogenic background, followed by single cell RNA sequencing(scRNA seq). This framework is borrowed from conven tional human expression quantitative loci (eQTL) studies, but with individual humans replaced by individual cells;variants replaced by 'unlinked' combinations of guide RNA programmed perturbations per cell; and tissue level RNA seq of many individuals replaced by scRNA seq of manycells. We applied CRISPR QTL mapping to evaluate 1,119 candidate enhancers with no strong a priori hypothesis as to their target gene(s). Perturbations were made by a nuclease dead Cas9 tethered to KRAB, and introduced at a mean âallele frequency âof 1.1% into a population of 47,650 proï¬led human K562 cells (median of 15 gRNAs identi ï¬ed per cell). We tested for differential expression of all genes within 1 megabase of each candidate enhancer, evaluating 17,584 potential enhancer target gene relationships in oneexperiment. We identify 128 cisCRISPR QTLs whose targeting resulted in downregulation of 105 nearby genes (of which 49 genes are thought to underlie disease). Weanticipate that the power of CRISPR QTL mapping will facilitate the comprehensive characterization of enhancer gene relationships, thus advancing interpretation of non coding variants discovered through WGS.

28918,"Whole chromosomal aneuploidies loss and/or gain of chromosomes from a euploid complement are responsible for the low fecundity in humans. Here we use mouseembryo as a model system to understand how mosaic aneuploidy affects embryonic development. To experimentally induce chromosome missegregation in thecleavage stage embryos, we inhibit the master spindle assembly checkpoint kinase Mps1, which results in a high percentage of aneuploid cells in the embryos. We introducemosaicism in the system by making chimeras using euploid and aneuploid cells. Detailed analysis of such chimeras revealed that during blastocyst maturation abnormal cellscontributing to the inner cell mass undergo preferential elimination up to 40%. Using an in vitro culture system capable of recapitulating in vivo mosaic embryos duringperi implantation development and time lapse imaging, we have found aneuploid cells are further preferentially elimi nated from the epiblast via apoptosis. Moreover, wedemonstrate that autophagy genes are signi ï¬cantly upre gulated in aneuploid cells. Using pharmacological treat ments to knockdown genes involved in autophagyapoptosis, we have found the onset of autophagy mediated apoptosis during embryogenesis. Overall, our ï¬ndings suggest that p53 mediated autophagy promotes apoptosis ofaneuploid cells in mouse preimplantation embryos.

Withthe help of massively parallel sequencing technologies, the majority of these rare disorders have been linked to patho genic variants in genes encoding glycosyltransferases ( âlin keropathies â), sulfotransferases, epimerases or transporters, required for glycosaminoglycan (GAG) biosynthesis. These ï¬ndings support the existence of a new group of inborn errors of development de ï¬ned by impaired GAG biosynthesis. However, several ï¬ndings suggest that GAG synthesis is more complex than previously described and that there are anumber of partners of unknown function still to be identi ï¬ed. Using exome sequencing, we identi ï¬ed homozygous mutations in SLC10A7 inï¬ve individuals with a skeletal dysplasia with dislocations and amelogenesis imperfecta. Common features were severe growth retardation< 3SD, cleft palate, yellow/brown teeth, knee dislocations, spineanomalies and advanced carpal ossi ï¬cation. SLC10A7 encodes a 10 transmembrane domain transporter located at the plasma membrane, with a yet unidenti ï¬ed substrate. Functional studies in vitro demonstrated that SLC10A7 mutations were loss of functions mutations reducing SLC10A7 protein expression. We generated a Slc10a7 / mouse model which displayed short long bones, growth plate disorganization and tooth enamel anomalies, recapi tulating the human phenotype. Furthermore, we identi ï¬ed decreased heparan sulfate levels in Slc10a7 / mouse cartilage and patient ï¬broblasts.

Using Hi C analysis of long range chromosome interactions, including a novel approach for haplotype speciï¬c Hi C analysis, and ChIP Seq analysis of regulatory histone marks, we studied the epigenomic effects of the prominent heterozygous large deletion CNV on chromo some 22q11.2, with replication analyses for the CNV on 1q21.1 [BioRxiv 182451]. There are local and global gene expression changes as well as pronounced and multilayered effects on chromatin states, chromosome folding and topological domains of the chromatin, that emanate from the large CNV locus. Regulatory histone marks are altered in the deletion ï¬anking regions, in opposing directions for activating and repressing marks. Histone marks are changed along chromosome 22qand genome wide. Chromosome interaction patterns are weakened within the deletion boundaries and strengthened between the deletion ï¬anking regions. The long range folding contacts between the telomeric end of chromosome 22q and the distal deletion ï¬anking region are increased. Using haplotype speci ï¬c Hi C analysis we determined that on the chromosome 22q with deletion the topological domain spanning the CNV boundaries is deleted in its entirety while neighboring domains interact more intenselywith each other. Finally, there is a widespread and complex effect on chromosome interactions genome wide, i.e. involving all other autosomes, with some of this effect tiedto the deletion region on 22q11.2. These ï¬ndings suggest novel principles of how such large genomic deletions can alter nuclear organization and affectgenomic molecular activity. NIH grants X. Zhang: None. Y. Zhang: None. X.

Their high genetic heterogeneity hinders the devel opment of effective gene based therapies. We have recentlydemonstrated that the microRNA miR 204 is essential for retinal function and plays a pathogenic role in IRD in humans. Therefore, we investigated the potential ther apeutic action of this microRNA in IRDs. Materials and Methods: We delivered by subretinal injection an adeno associated viral vector carrying the miR 204 precursor to the Aipl1 knockout and the P347S RHO transgenic mouse lines, models of autosomal recessive and dominant forms of IRDs, respectively. The impact on retinalfunction and degeneration was assessed by electroretino graphic and immunohistological analyses. Results: We detected a notable improvement of the ERG response in the miR 204 injected eyes of P347S RHO mice. This effect persisted for two months post injection and was prevalent under photopic conditions that re ï¬ect cone activity. We also observed a preservation of cone photo receptors and a signi ï¬cant decrease in apoptotic photo receptor cells. Photoreceptors were better preserved also inthe miR204 injected eyes of Aipl1 knockout mice. Tran scriptome analysis suggested that dampening of microglia activation represents one of the main mechanisms under lying the neuroprotective effect of miR 204. Conclusions: Ourï¬ndings indicate that the subretinal delivery of miR 204 attenuates retinal degeneration in IRDmouse models and preserves retinal function, supporting the gene independent therapeutic potential of this microRNA.

Hydration of their reduced forms (either spontaneously if the temperature is elevated or following speciï¬c enzymatic processes) leads to the accumulation of NADHX and NADPHX, which are toxic and can inhibit a number of dehydrogenases. Highly conserved dehydrataseNAD(P)HX Dehydratase (NAXD) is one of the key intra cellular NADHX/NADPHX repair enzymes. Materials and Methods: We describe 6 unrelated children with generally fever induced recurrent episodic neurological impairment and/or cardiac failure with early demise, and its genetic basis. Results: Genomic sequencing revealed biallelic NAXD variants in all cases, and in silico analyses predicting potential pathogenicity for each of them. Pathogenicity wasfunctionally validated using patient ï¬broblasts through a combination of transcript analysis (splicing abnormality in one case), demonstration of markedly elevated S NADHX,R NADHX and cyclic NADHX, impaired mitochondrial function, and reduced viability in culture media containing galactose and azide but not glucose. Transduction withwildtype NAXD restored damaged metabolite levels back to normal. Finally, in vitro studies revealed that the two missense variants [(p.(Gly63Ser) and p.(Arg608Cys)] werethermolabile, and speci ï¬c ATP dependent NADHX dehy dratase activity showed abnormal enzyme kinetics. Conclusion: This is the ï¬rst report of a human disorder caused by NAXD de ï¬ciency, showing remarkable clinical overlap with the other known defect of the NADH/NADPH repair pathway, NAXE de ï¬ciency.

Deletion cause Williams Beuren syn drome (WBS) characterized by hypersociability, anxiety and intellectual disability, while duplication give rise to 7qduplication syndrome (7DupASD) with severe impairments in language, anxiety and autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Despite the well established genetic underpinnings of these disorders effective treatments are unavailable. Converging evidence points to GTF2I as a major player mediating the cognitive behavioral phenotype associated with WBS and7DupASD. We showed previously in patient derived iPSC and neural progenitors that GTF2I associates with LSD1 to suppress expression of genes involved in neuronal function,whereas inhibition of LSD1 restored gene expression balance. Here we used mouse models together with patient derived 3D cortical organoids and single cell transcriptomics to dissectthe molecular foundations of WBS and 7DupASD. Mice with duplication of GTF2I faithfully recapitulated the ASD like phenotype in the three chambered sociability apparatus. Remarkably, inhibition of LSD1 with an irreversible inhibitor, rescued the ASD like phenotype. Bulk and single cell RNAseq from cortical organoids revealed divergent dynam ics of neuronal maturation with accelerated maturation in 7DupASD and decelerated in WBS organoids resulting in a divergent neural fate, which was con ï¬rmed by relative abundance of basal progenitor populations. Strikingly, knockdown of GTF2I in 7DupASD organoids rescued neu ronal maturation rate to control levels. These ï¬ndings suggest that GTF2I LSD1 axis plays a critical role in social behavior and cognition by controlling the timing of cortical maturation. A. Lopez Tobon: None. R. Shyti: None. E.

Here we have used whole exome sequencing to uncover the endo plasmic reticulum lipid desaturase DEGS1 as the cau sative gene of a novel leukodystrophy. This enzyme catalizes the ï¬n a ls t e pi nt h e de novo biosynthesis of ceramides controlling the conv ersion of dihydroceramide (DhCer) to ceramide (Cer), and may play intriguing roles in antiapoptotic, and anabolic and insulin signalling. Through international collaborative networks, we have identi ï¬ed eighteen patients from twelve unrelated families carrying biallelic de leterious variants in the DEGS1 gene. Common features among the cases include severe hypomyelination, cerebellar atrophy, and thinning of the corpus callosum on MRI, accompanied by speechabnormalities, developmental delay and intellectual dis ability, suggesting a critical role of DEGS1 and ceramide metabolism in myelin development and maintenance. Patients âï¬broblasts exhibited accumulation of DhCer, which increased ROS production. Knockdown of the DEGS1 ortholog in Danio rerio recapitulated the bio chemical imbalance of ceram ides, showed diminished numbers of mature oligodendrocytes and impaired locomotor abilities. The enzymatic inhibition of cer amide synthase, one step prior to DEGS1 in the pathway, by the multiple sclerosis treatment Fingolimod (FTY720), restored the critic al DhCer/Cer balance, and ameliorated the cellular and locomotor phenotypes in the zebra ï¬sh model. These results pave the way to clinical translation, illustrating the tr ansformative, timely impact of clinical genomics in patient care.

28922,"2Humboldt University, Berlin, Germany The CRISPR Cas9 system has recently emerged as a transformative technology in biological sciences, allowing rapid and ef ï¬cient targeted genome editing, chromosomal marking and gene regulation in a large variety of cells andorganisms. The system consists of Cas9, an enzyme that can be programmed with RNA guides to target site speci ï¬cally any DNA sequence of interest. The system is ef ï¬cient, versatile and easily programmable. CRISPR Cas9 research has developed into one of the most dynamic and fastest moving ï¬elds in life sciences and holds great promise for future biotechnical and biomedical applications. The CRISPR Cas9 system is remarkably simple in its design, close to a plug and play method, which can therefore beeasily leveraged for a large variety of gene targeting. Application of the system has been extraordinarily broad, including among many others the generation of transgenicanimals, genetic modi ï¬cation of various eukaryotic cell types, and genetic modi ï¬cation of plants and crops. Tool and kit service companies offer CRISPR Cas9 related pro ducts and at least three biotechnology companies have been founded during the past years to develop the technology for the treatment of serious human genetic disorders, withprobably many more to come. Already, the CRISPR Cas9 system is an integral and critical part of the toolbox for any researcher who intends to modify genetic information bymeans of targeted introduction or correction of mutations, replacement of genes, modi ï¬cation of DNA or modulation of transcription in any cell or organism and the applica tions of this breakthrough technology are continuing to increase at a rapid pace.

This observation could beexploited as a means to differentiate the fetal DNA popu lation from the maternal DNA in maternal circulation. For example, aneuploidies of fetal origin may result in aberrantgenomic representation among the shorter DNA molecules in the maternal plasma sample. While noninvasive prenatal testing by maternal plasma DNA sequencing generallyprovides high sensitivities and speci ï¬cities for the detection of common fetal chromosomal aneuploidies, false positive results may occur. We reasoned that the combined used ofcell free DNA counting and size measurements may allow one to identify the false positive cases. We applied the combined protocol to test for fetal chromosomal aneu ploidies among 20,000 cases seeking NIPT screening. The approach was able to identify sex chromosome aneuploidies of maternal origin, copy number variations of maternalorigin, artefacts caused by sequencing biases or conditions that perturbed the maternal plasma DNA pro ï¬le, such as systemic lupus erythematosus. The adoption of theapproach led to a substantial reduction in the number of reports that would otherwise become a false positive result with respect to the fetal chromosome pro ï¬le. Next, we reasoned that if cell free fetal DNA molecules were shorter than the cell free maternal DNA molecules, the fragmen tation sites of the two different population of DNA mole cules might be different. Interestingly, we demonstrated that the ending sites between the cell free fetal and maternal DNA molecules indeed showed consistent differences. Some of the ending sites were reproducibly detectable from maternal plasma collected from different pregnancies and served as a means to assess the fetal DNA fraction in thesample.

28925,"Street Hospital for Children NHS Foundation Trust, London, United Kingdom Non invasive prenatal testing (NIPT) using cell free DNA in maternal blood is an advanced screening test which has been shown to be highly accurate for Down syndrome aswell as trisomies 13 and 18. The clinical advantages of NIPT are that the test is safe, easy to conduct and can be administered within the ï¬rst trimester of pregnancy. Nevertheless, there are concerns that NIPT may compro mise informed decision making as the risk free nature of the test may lead parents to agree to testing without ade quate consideration of the potential outcomes including a positive NIPT result (thus requiring consideration about invasive testing) or an inconclusive result. Moreover,because NIPT is a blood test, consent procedures may potentially become less rigorous than those used for inva sive testing and the ease with which the test can be con ducted may promote routinisation of testing. A number of studies have been conducted in recent years to establish whether NIPT is undermining informed decision making. Inthis talk I will present key ï¬ndings from this body of lit erature as well as presenting the ï¬ndings from my own research from the RAPID study where we adapted theMultidimensional Measure of Informed Choice (MMIC) developed by Marteau et al. (2001) for NIPT. The adaptedmeasure was used in both a research and a routine clinical setting and rates of informed choice were measured and compared. Recommendations for practice relating to how best to facilitate informed decision making in the prenatal clinic will also be discussed. C. Lewis: None. S02 DNA damage and repair in cancer",2018

We identify variable DNA mismatch repair (MMR) as the basis of this domain scale variation. While regionalmutation rates are broadly stable between tumors, there are systematic differences that accurately re ï¬ect the cancer cell of origin, related to changes in replication timing and geneexpression.

Such clustered mutations occur in tumors associated withcarcinogen exposure and they target H3K36me3 marked chromatin, commonly found at 3 âends of transcribed genes. In the absence of carcinogens however, the H3K36me3regions have a considerably lower mutation rate. This is because the canonical, error free MMR is normally targeted towards the H3K36me3 histone mark, protecting activegenes from alterations. Carcinogens therefore not only increase mutation burden, but can also redistribute muta tions to the more important regions of the genome byactivating error prone DNA repair. We predict this can contribute a substantial mutation load in many tumors such as melanoma, gastrointestinal tract and lung cancers, withhigh potential to yield driver mutations (Supek and Lehner, 2017 Cell).

28928,"The complex gene expression of developmental genes often relies on the communication between promoters and long range regulatory elements called enhancers. Enhancers andpromoters can interact in the nuclear space in a tissue speciï¬c or tissue unspeci ï¬c manner. Yet little is known about the functional role of these different modes of inter actions. Here we present two in depth functional studies illustrating how these modes of interaction contribute to achieve speci ï¬c expression patterns and transcriptional robustness in vivo. In the ï¬rst case, the disruption of a pre established, tissue unspeci ï¬c interaction between the Shh promoter and its limb enhancer strongly reduces Shhtran scription. In the second case, a tissue speci ï¬c enhancer promoter interaction modulates the fore and hindlimb activity of an enhancer to drive Pitx1 transcription in hin dlimb only. The disturbance of this particular communica tion in human patients and in mice with structural variationsleads to gene endo activation and a partial arm to leg transformation. In conclusion, our data not only suggest an interplay between enhancer speci ï¬city, transcriptional robustness and 3D chromatin dynamics but also provide a framework to understand the pathomechanism of many non coding mutations.

28929,"Mechanisms by which epiphenotypes are transmitted between generations through the paternal germline remainpoorly understood. The nuclei of mammalian sperm are thought to be highly condensed and the DNA mostly cov ered by protamines with only a few retained nucleosomes. Epigenetic information stored in the form of DNA methy lation is erased from paternal chromosomes after fertiliza tion. Results from our lab suggest a more complex picture ofthe mouse sperm epigenome, indicating the presence of multiple histone modi ï¬cations at retained nucleosomes. Most promoters in mouse sperm contain the elongating formof RNA polymerase II, and are ï¬anked by several positioned nucleosomes marked by a variety of active histone mod iï¬cations. The sperm genome is bound by several tran scription factors, including Mediator, the pioneer factor FoxA1, and estrogen receptor alpha. These proteins are found at promoters, enhancers, and super enhancers, manyof which are active in mESCs or adult tissues. CTCF and cohesin are also present in sperm DNA, where they organize the sperm genome into domains that overlap extensivelywith those found in mESCs. This information suggests that mammalian sperm contain a rich and complex palette of epigenetic information that could be altered by environ mental factors to paint novel phenotypic outcomes in the next generation. This is supported by experiments in which pregnant females exposed to endocrine disruptor chemicalsgive rise to progeny showing a variety of phenotypes, including obesity. The obese phenotype is transmitted between generations in the absence of further exposure. Experiments indicate that approximately 110 new protein binding sites are present in the sperm and fat tissue of obese mice from the F1 through the F4 generations. These newbinding sites correspond to CTCF and ERalpha, suggesting that effects of these proteins on 3D chromatin organization and transcription of speci ï¬c genes are responsible for the establishment and transmission of epiphenotypes.

GRANADA, Hospital Universitario Virgen delas Nieves, Granada, Spain Meniere Disease (MD) represents a heterogeneous group of relatively rare disorders with three core symptoms: episodic vertigo, tinnitus and sensorineural hearing loss involving low and medium frequencies. Although themajority of cases are considered sporadic, familial aggre gation has been recognized in European and Korean populations, but the ï¬nding of familial MD genes has been elusive until the last few years. Detailed phenotyping and hierarchical cluster analyses have found several clinical predictors for different subgroups of patients, which mayindicate different mechanisms of disease, including genetic and immune factors. The familial cluster include all cases with unilateral or bilateral MD, and most familiesshow an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance with incomplete penetrance and variable expressivity in Eur opean population. Whole exome sequencing have foundrare and novel variants in 6 ge nes associated with familial MD including COCH, FAM136A, DTNA, PRKCB, SEMA3D andDPT genes; however, no consistent gene has been described in multiple unr elated families. Although the signi ï¬cance of these variants remain to be established in animal models, the candidate genes are involved in verydifferent functions such as protein phosphorylation, axonal guiding signalling or structural proteins in the cytoskele ton or extracellular matrix. So, familial MD shows geneticheterogeneity as it has been also demonstrated for syn dromic and non syndromic sensorineural hearing loss. To investigate the immunogenetic contribution in MD, wehave also conducted a genome association study using a high density genotyping array containing covering loci associated with autoimmunity (Immunochip). Our grouphave identi ï¬ed a locus in the classical class I subregion of the MHC ~9 kb at 6p21.33 (31,081,878 31,090,401), being the leading signal rs4947296 (metanalysis,OR , 2.089 (1.661 2.627); p,1.39x 10 â09). The variant is associated with bilateral MD in the Spanish populationand it is enriched in patients with a comorbid autoimmune disorder. Moreover, rs4947296 is a trans expression quantitatve trait locus (eQTL) which regulates gene expression of multiple genes in the tumor necrosis factor like weak induced of apoptosis (TWEAK)/Fn14 pathway in peripheral mononuclear cells (PBMCs). By usinggenotype conditioned PBMCs, we found an increase of NF ÎºB mediated in ï¬ammatory response in the carriers of the risk genotype. Meniere disease shows clinical andgenetic heterogeneity and common and rare variants may contribute to shape the phenotype in a given patient. Ongoing projects include exome sequencing in >100familial MD patients or early onset sporadic cases and the analysis of two custom sequencing panels designed by our group using data mining, phenotyping information andgene expression pro ï¬les in cochlear and vestibular supporting cells.

28931,"United Kingdom The sensory epithelia of the cochlea and vestibular system are composed of sensory âhair âcells and non sensory supporting cells. Supporting cells surround each hair celland separated it from its neighbours. Hair cells derive their name from the organised bundle of projections from their apical surface. During development expression of the tran scription factor Atonal Homologue 1(Atoh1) in precursor cells directs differentiation towards a hair cell fate. The ï¬rst cells to do so activate Notch Delta signalling in theirimmediate neighbours to inhibit Atoh1 expression. The laterally inhibited cells differentiate as supporting cells. Death of hair cells is a major cause of hearing loss andvestibular dysfunction, which manifests as dizziness, ver tigo and imbalance. Ageing and certain drugs with ototoxic side effects, most notably aminoglycoside antibiotics, areamongst the primary causes of hair cell death. When a hair cell dies the surrounding supporting cells close the lesions. In non mammalian vertebrates, new hair cells are generatedfrom the supporting cells, some following supporting cell division, others by direct conversion of supporting cells. Abstracts from the 51stEuropean Society of Human Genetics Conference: Oral. . . 757There is no hair cell regeneration in the mammalian cochlea. However, there is a limited capacity to regenerate hair cells in the mammalian vestibular system through direct phenotypic conversion of supporting cells. We have some evidence that spontaneous regeneration of hair cells may occur throughout life in the human vestibular system. Usinghuman vestibular sensory epithelia in explant culture, hair cells were ablated by incubation in an aminoglycoside (gentamicin). Subsequent transduction of supporting cellswith ATOH1 using an Ad 2 viral vector resulted in gen eration of highly signi ï¬cant numbers of cells expressing the hair cell maker protein myosin VIIa. Cells expressingmyosin VIIa were also generated after blocking the Notch signalling pathway with TAPI 1 but much less ef ï¬ciently. Transcriptomic analysis following ATOH1 transduction conï¬rmed up regulation of 335 putative hair cell marker genes, including several postulated downstream targets of ATOH1 , as well as downregulation of 5 chromatin modi ï¬ers. Morphological analysis revealed numerous cells bearing dense clusters of microvilli at the apical surfaces. However, no cells bore organised hair bundles and severalexpected hair cell markers genes were not expressed. The results show a potential to induce conversion of supporting cells in the vestibular sensory tissues of humans, but thatdifferentiation of fully functional hair cells is incomplete under the conditions used. This suggests the likely necessity of additional factors to achieve this goal. R. R. Taylor: None. S05 Large scale genetic studies in complex disease",2018

Thus, the prediction of silent atherosclerotic alterationsin coronary arteries is a highly relevant medical need. Recent genomic research identi ï¬ed numerous genetic var iants that associate with a higher prevalence of coronary disease. At present, association with coronary artery disease has been demonstrated at more than 160 chromosomal locations with risk alleles increasing relative risk by 5 25%per allele. Moreover, genetic variants primarily affecting cardiovascular risk factors such as hypertension or LDL cholesterol were shown to affect the risk of coronary diseaseas well. This enormous progress has been facilitated by genome wide association studies. By nature, these studies focus on frequent alleles. Thus, the alleles that have been identi ï¬ed to increase the risk of coronary disease are also relatively frequent in our population. As a consequence, virtually all individuals of our population carry a variable degree ofgenetic predisposition for coronary artery disease.

A deeper understanding of these factors, and the mechanisms through which they in ï¬uence disease risk and development, is a prerequisite if we are to develop moreeffective strategies for prevention and treatment. Over the past decade there has been substantial progress towards these goals. The most recent genome wide association study(involving nearly a million subjects) has extended the number of independent genetic signals for type 2 diabetes beyond 400.

S06 Liquid biopsies in cancer",2018
28934,"Liquid biopsy tumor genotyping using circulating cell free tumor DNA (ctDNA) in the blood has been recently applied to molecularly pro ï¬le cancer patients, monitoring tumor burden during therapy and uncovering novelmechanisms of resistance to targeted therapies. We used metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) as a model system to assess whether liquid biopsies could in principle uncovermolecular mechanisms responsible for the emergence of resistance to targeted therapies, in particular to the mono clonal antibodies (moAbs) cetuximab and panitumumab. Emerging evidence indicates that escape from EGFR tar geted therapy might be molecularly heterogeneous and involve several genes. We exploited plasma ctDNA analysisby Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) and Digital PCR (ddPCR) in mCRC patients to de ï¬ne gene alterations responsible for primary or acquired resistance to anti EGFRtherapies. While most mCRC patients who receive anti EGFR antibodies develop KRAS mutations during the course oftherapy we found that additional mutations affecting key nodes of the EGFR signaling pathway can also confer resistance. An interesting mCRC case harbored a novelMAP2K1 mutation (p. K57T) in tissue and liquid biopsies post EGFR blockade. To validate the biological and molecular relevance of this mutation in resistance to anti EGFR therapy, we used a CRC cell line which harbored a MAP2K1 mutation when made resistant to CMAB. Biochemical analysis showed that MAP2K1 variantsaffecting position p. K57 drive constitutive activation of MEK and ERK and conferred resistance to CMAB and PMAB. However, the combination of the MEK inhibitortrametinib with either CMAB or PMAB restored sensitivity, suggesting a potential therapeutic strategy to overcome resistance to EGFR blockade caused by this mutation. Accordingly, the patient was treated with the combination of PMAB and trametinib. After 3 months, imagingdemonstrated a reduction in size of the biopsied liver metastasis harboring the MAP2K1 mutation, but revealed that some other lesions had progressed. Pre treatment plasma ctDNA was analyzed using NGS, con ï¬rming the presence of MAP2K1 variant, but unveiling an additional KRAS mutation. Longitudinal analysis of plasma samplesunveiled that MAP2K1 mutant levels declined, while KRAS mutant increased markedly during therapy, indicat ing outgrowth of a resistant KRAS mutant clone. Biopsy ofa different liver metastasis âsegment that progressed despite PMAB and trametinib revealed the same KRAS mutation identi ï¬ed in ctDNA. In a separate study, we focused on Her2 ampli ï¬ed CRC. Targeting HER2 is effective in 30% of ERBB2 ampli ï¬ed metastatic colorectal cancer, and most sensitive caseseventually relapse. We studied the molecular evolution of individual metastases during treatment to discover spa tially resolved determinants of resistance. ctDNA analysis identi ï¬ed alterations associated with lack of response in the majority of refractory patients. CtDNA pro ï¬les and lesion speci ï¬c radiographic reports revealed organ and metastasis private evoluti onary patterns in patients who had initially responded. Whe n radiologic assessments documented progressive disease in target lesions,response to HER2 blockade was often retained in other metastases. Genomic and functional analyses on samples and cell models from eight metastases of a patient co recruited to a post mortem study unveiled lesion speci ï¬c evolutionary trees and pharmacologic vulnerabilities. A correlation between lesions âsize and contribution of distinct metastases to plasma ctDNA was observed.

28936,"Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Melbourne, Australia,3The Royal Melbourne Hospital, Melbourne, Australia Women who carry a germline mutation in BRCA1 are at heightened risk of developing breast (and ovarian) cancer. Tumors often arise at an early age, with the peak relative risk occurring before 40 years of age. Although breast MRI has substantially improved screening for mutation carriers, this isnot preventive and its impact on mortality is uncertain. Interval cancers (arising between screening) are not uncom mon and screen detected tumors can be relatively advanced. Furthermore, tumors are usually triple negative with a basal like phenotype, necessitating chemotherapy even if identi ï¬ed early. Asymptomatic BRCA1 mutation carriers have few effective breast cancer prevention options beyond bilateral prophylactic mastectomy (BPM). Although BPM reduces the risk of breast cancer by up to 90%, only a subset of mutationcarriers pursue this option. An effective prevention therapy therefore remains an important area of need. RANKL is an important paracrine mediator of progester one signaling in breast tissue. Activation of the RANKL/ RANK signaling has been shown to accelerate tumor formation and to be associated with aggressive tumorbehavior in vivo. Conversely, ablation of RANK signaling in mammary epithelium delays the onset of medroxypro gesterone/DMBA driven mammary tumors. Accumulatingevidence points to a role for progesterone/RANKL/RANK mediated signaling in breast tumorigenesis in BRCA1 mutation carriers. BRCA1 mutation carriers may have elevated levels of serum progesterone during the luteal phase compared to non carriers and possibly augmentedRANKL activity due to reduced levels of the endogenous soluble decoy receptor osteoprotegerin (OPG). Our recent ï¬ndings suggest that the RANK and down stream NF ÎºB pathways are aberrantly activated in luminal progenitor cells in preneoplastic (ostensibly normal) BRCA1 mut/+breast tissue. The augmented proliferation of these cells and their predilection for DNA damage suggest that they are prime cellular targets for basal like breast cancers arising in BRCA1 mutation carriers. Targeting of RANK+progenitors using a RANKL inhibitor in pre clinical models has revealed a promising new prevention strategy for these high risk women. These ï¬ndings have raised the possibility that the RANKL inhibitor denosumab (currently only approved for the treatment of osteoporosis and bone metastases) could be ârepurposed âas a breast cancer prevention drug. Plans are underway to formally test this hypothesis in an international, randomized, double blind, placebo controlled multi center phase 3 preventionstudy, âBRCA P â, led by the Austrian Breast & Colorectal Study Group.

Most studies ofdevelopmental programming of energy balance have focused on persistent alterations in food intake; energy expenditure has been relatively underemphasized.

In the past several years we have studied three different mouse models of developmentalprogramming of energy balance.

Epigenetic modi ï¬cations of DNA can explain a series of non Mendelian disease features such as discordance of identical twins, relatively late age of onset, ï¬uctuating course and sometimes partial or even full recovery. Prin ciples for experimental epigenomic studies in disease are still being developed. We recently discovered that DNA modiï¬cations in somatic differentiated cells of humans and mice exhibit circadian oscillations. Such oscillating cyto sines (osc modCs) were linked to the circadian tran scriptome and explained a fraction of epigenetic variation,which has traditionally been treated as stochastic. We also found that osc modCs were associated with the aging epi genome, where the osc modCs preceded age dependentDNA modi ï¬cation changes, and osc modC amplitude strongly correlated with the magnitude of the aging effect. These ï¬ndings indicate that epigenetic aging outcomes, to some extent, can be predicted from the circadian epige nomic parameters at a younger age.

28948,"Cambridge, United Kingdom Somatic mutations accumulate in healthy cells throughout life. Most of these mutations do not alter cell behavior and accumulate passively, but occasionally a key gene is alteredin a way that provides mutant cells with a competitive advantage. This leads to the formation of large clones that persist long term in normal tissues. However, detecting suchclones is challenging due to the dif ï¬culties of identifying mutations present in small numbers of cells. The most highly mutated normal tissue reported to date is sun exposed human skin. Most mutations are caused by ultra violet light and it is unclear whether aged sun exposed skin represents a special case due to a lifetime exposure to apowerful mutagen. This motivated us to investigate the mutational landscape of a similar tissue, the lining of the oesophagus, which also consists of layers of keratinocytes. As in the skin, cells are continually shed from the tissue surface and replaced by proliferation throughout life. However, the exposure to mutagens and the tissue envir onment in an internal epithelium led are very different from the skin, leading us to hypothesize that normal oesophagus764 J. del Picchiamay have a distinct mutational landscape. We mapped mutant clones in normal oesophageal epithelium from nine donors aged 20 75 using ultra deep targeted sequencing for 74 genes implicated in epithelial cancers. We found the density of mutant clones increased progressively, rising to over 100/cm2by middle age. Mutations were mainly caused by age related mutational processes. There was strong Darwinian positive selection of clones carrying mutations in 14 genes that are also recurrently mutated in oesophagealcancers. By middle age NOTCH1 andTP53 mutant clones cover over 40% and 10% of the epithelium respectively. Remarkably, the prevalence of NOTCH1 mutations in nor mal esophagus is several times higher than in oesophageal cancers. We conclude that the normal oesophagus is an evolving patchwork of mutant clones, which colonize themajority of the epithelium as we age. S15 Understanding non coding variant",2018

Epigenetic mechanisms are essential for embryonic devel opment, but they also play an important role during adultlife. In addition to the epigenetic changes that occur that have a speci ï¬c biological purpose, genomic DNA can also accumulate epigenetic alterations or noise during lifetime. Ithas been proposed that this process, known as ""epigenetic drift"", is associated with age related diseases. Although it isAbstracts from the 51stEuropean Society of Human Genetics Conference: Oral. . . 765well known that cancer is an age dependent disease, the underlying molecular mechanisms are still poorly under stood. In this regard, recent work has shown that aberrant DNA hypermethylation in aging and cancer share similar chromatin signatures. It is also well established that in the processes of both aging and cancer there is a global loss ofDNA methylation. However, it remains unknown whether the chromatin signatures of DNA hypomethylation were also similar in aging and cancer. Conceptually, this is animportant issue because the similarity of the chromatin signatures of DNA hypermethylation in cancer and aging has led to the proposal that DNA methylation is a molecularlink between the two processes. In my talk, I will present recent work from our laboratory showing that: i) the genomic distribution of differentially methylated CpG sitesis similar in aging and cancer, ii) there is a considerable tissue independent component to DNA methylation chan ges in both aging and cancer and, iii) in contrast to DNAhypermethylation, the chromatin signatures of DNA hypo methylation in aging and cancer are different. These results reveal novel aspects of the relationship between DNAmethylation and aging that could be important to under standing the possible role of DNA methylation as a mole cular link between aging and cancer.

S18 Regulatory sequence functions and element",2018
28955,"Bioinformatics Institute, Hinxton, United Kingdom,3CRUK CI, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, United Kingdom Tissues and cell types have largely conserved gene expression programs across mammals, enabling extra polation from animal studies to human medical conditions. These gene expression patterns are controlled by collec tions of regulatory elements combining promoters and tissue speci ï¬c enhancers. However, it is now well documented that regulatory elements have experiencedextensive divergence and turn over during mammalian evolution. How stable gene expression is maintained by rapidly evolving regulatory landscapes remains a funda mental question in evolutionary genetics, as well as a crucial prior to the use of animal models for human func tional genetics. We report here on an in depth analysis of gene expression and regulation across mammalian evolution. Using liver as a representative organ, we pro ï¬led gene expression as well as histone marks typical of active promoters and enhancers in 20 different mammals. We used this data to quantify how promoters and enhancers evolve in mammals, and how thisevolution affects gene expression downstream. This analy sis revealed a complex relationship between gene expres sion and regulatory evolution. First, we show that promotersand enhancers are under signi ï¬cantly different evolutionary pressures: promoters remain largely active across mammals while enhancers are much more evolutionarily labile. Second, regulatory elements exhibit a broad range of evolutionary plasticity from those active across most mammals to those found in only one or a few species. We show how these degrees of conservation correlate with local gene functions, gene expression levels, and gene expression stability. Importantly, we report that highlyexpressed and stable genes are associated with complex arrays of promoters and enhancers, which can exhibit signiï¬cant turnover across species as long as the overall landscape complexity is maintained. Our results underscore how functional redundancy in regulatory programs allows for resilience at the gene expression level in mammaliangenomes. C. Berthelot: None. D. Villar: None. D. T. Odom: None.

28956,"enhancers. These segments of the DNA act as switches to regulate where and when the approximately 20,000 genes are expressed. As such, enhancers provide the instructions for tissue speci ï¬c gene expression, thus enabling successful development and cellular integrity. Numerous studies havedemonstrated that mutations in enhancers can alter tissue speciï¬c expression and cause phenotypic variation and disease. For example, a single mutation in a limbbud enhancer leads to aberrant expression of the gene SHH and results in extra ï¬ngers and toes. In an enhancer for the membrane protein Duffy, a point mutation results inmalarial resistance. Computational analysis suggests that the majority of mutations associated with disease are located within enhancers. Despite the fundamental impor tance of enhancers for successful development and their discovery over 30 years ago, we lack a broad understanding of how enhancer sequence encodes tissue speci ï¬c expres sion. As a result we do not understand which changes in enhancer sequence are simply inert variation between individuals and which mutations lead to phenotypicdiversity and disease. These fundamental questions remain unsolved because we cannot relate enhancer sequence to gene expression patterns and phenotype on a scale suf ï¬ cient to identify the overarching regulatory principles. The two main challenges in deciphering the relationship between enhancer sequence and tissue speci ï¬cg e n e expression are: 1) the complexity of enhancers, and 2) the complexity of organisms. To address these problems, we have developed high throughput functional assays totest millions of enhancer variants in millions of whole developing embryos. The model organism that enables such in depth functional approaches is the marine chordateCiona intestinalis .

28957,"More than 450 regions in the human genome have perfect sequence conservation between human and rodents, andthese âultraconserved âsites have intrigued biologists in the decade since they were ï¬rst described. While it is knownthat many of these sequences are distant acting enhancers, the drivers of such extraordinary evolutionary constraint remain unclear. Surprisingly, initial deletion studies showed that the loss of individual ultraconserved enhancers in mice has no obvious impact on viability or fertility. To explore this apparent discrepancy between extreme evolutionaryconstraint and lack of obvious phenotypes in more depth, we examined the in vivo consequences of loss of a series of ultraconserved enhancers near the essential neuronal tran scription factor Arx. The Arxlocus has an unusually high density of ultraconserved sites, including the three longest perfectly human mouse rat conserved sequences in thegenome. Four ultraconserved regions near Arxdrive gene expression in the developing forebrain, in patterns that cumulatively recapitulate the gene âs expression domains. Single cell transcriptome sequencing from transgenic embryos con ï¬rmed that the enhancer activity is speci ï¬ct o Arx expressing neuronal subpopulations. We engineered mice missing these four enhancers singly, as well as pair wise for enhancers that display overlapping in vivo activity patterns. While the loss of any single or pair of ultra conserved enhancers resulted in viable and fertile mice, detailed phenotyping revealed neurological or growth abnormalities in nearly all cases, including substantial def icits of cholinergic neurons, altered densities of cortical interneuron populations, and abnormalities of the dentate gyrus. Our results demonstrate the functional importance ofultraconserved enhancers and highlight that extreme sequence conservation may result from evolutionary selec tion against ï¬tness de ï¬cits that appear subtle in a laboratory setting.

28959,"Li Fraumeni syndrome is a remarkable predisposition to cancer due to germline mutations of the TP53 suppressor gene and characterized by early onset tumours and a wide tumour spectrum. Diagnosis criteria have sequentially been updated in order to cover the 4 different clinical presentations asso ciated with germline TP53 mutations: Familial presentation: Proband with a LFS spectrum tumour (soft tissue sarcomas (STS), osteosarcoma, adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC), cen tral nervous system (CNS) tumours or female breast cancer)prior to age 46 years AND at least one ï¬rst or second degree relative with a LFS tumour before the age of 56 years or with multiple tumours. (2) Multiple tumours: Patient with multiple malignancies, two of which belonging to the LFS spectrum, theï¬rst being developed before 46 years or with a second tumour developed within a radiotherapy ï¬eld; (3) Rare tumours: Patients with ACC, choroid plexus tumours (CPT) or embryonal anaplastic subtype rhabdomyosarcoma (anRMS); (4) Breast cancer before age 31 years. Therefore, familial history is not mandatory to consider the presence of a germline TP53 mutation in a patient. Independently of the familial history, the mutation detection rate in children pre senting with ACC, CPT or anRMS is approximately 50%, and in females with breast carcinoma before 31 years 6%. The contribution to LFS of de novo mutations has recently been estimated to be at least 14% and approximately 1/5 of these denovo mutations occur during embryonic development, resulting therefore in mosaics. TP53 being included in cancer gene panels, germline TP53 mutations are now more fre quently identi ï¬ed in patients who have developed only adultcancers. The penetrance of TP53 mutations is not known and heterogeneous and depends both from the type of alteration and modi ï¬er factors. Dominant negative missense mutations are usually highly penetrant and associated with the severe forms of LFS characterized by childhood cancers. Null mutations are predominantly identi ï¬ed in families with only adult cancers and have a lower penetrance. Germline TP53 mutations acting as permissive mutations to oncogenic stres ses, their phenotypic expression is also probably dependent onenvironmental factors. The recently published surveillance protocols are heavy and are based, from the ï¬rst year of life, on abdominal ultrasound every 4 6 months, annual total bodyMRI, annual brain MRI, and in females from 20 years on annual breast MRI. Considering the diversity of the clinical severity associated to germline TP53 mutations, the bene ï¬ts of such heavy protocols regardless to the psychological impacts should be carefully analyzed and discussed in each family. TP53 mutation carriers have an exceptionally high risk of developing multiple primary tumours, estimated at least to 40%. Several lines of evidence show, in agreement with the key role of p53 in response to DNA damage, thatradiotherapy and genotoxic chemotherapies contribute to the development of secondary tumours in LFS. Therefore, in patients with clinical presentations strongly suggestive ofLFS, analysis of TP53 should be performed before the initiation of treatment and in mutation carriers, radiotherapy should be, only if possible, avoided, surgical treatmentprioritized and non genotoxic treatments, such as immu notherapies, considered in the future.

Classi ï¬cation of lncRNAs revealed that most inter genic lncRNAs are derived from enhancer like regions rather than classic promoters and GWAS trait associated SNPs enriched at lncRNA loci were speci ï¬cally expressed in cell types relevant to the speci ï¬c diseases, suggesting their roles in diseases.

In recent years, guidelines with therapeutic recommendations have become available to guide clinicians how to interpret and adjust drug therapy based upon a pharmacogenomic test result. Indeed, for some drug gene pairs (such as capecitabine âDPYD; mercaptopurine TPMT) pre therapeutic testing has been implemented inroutine clinical care in some centers but there remain barriers for widescale implementation of pre therapeutic testing.

Therefore, pre emptive testing (that is: multiple pharmacogenomic variants are collected prospec tively and embedded into the patient âs medical record) of a panel of genetic variants seems a promising and cost effective approach. We have performed a pilot study in 200 primary care patients with pre emptive testing of a PGx panel with the aim to reduce ADRs.

Using a variety of reporter ES cell lines and comparison with the embryo we observe organization of Wnt, Nodal and FGFsignaling that mirrors events in the embryo and have shown that they can develop in culture until an equivalent of embryonic day 9 (E9). We observe that these embryonicorganoids develop anteroposterior, dorsoventral as well as bilateral asymmetries. Analysis of pattern formation in these aggregates suggests that they do not develop throughstandard self organization but that there is a strong genetic components to what otherwise would be simple thermo dynamically driven process. These issues will be discussedin course of the talk. E08 Congenital vasculopathies",2018

28971,"Neurodegeneration with brain iron accumulation (NBIA) is a genetically heterogeneous condition due to iron accumu lation in basal ganglia, manifesting as a progressive extra pyramidal syndrome with dystonia, rigidity and choreoathetosis. Mutations in eleven genes have been hitherto identi ï¬ed. Only two genes are reportedly involved in iron metabolism, FTL andCP, respectively encoding the light subunit of ferritin, and ceruloplasmin. How the other NBIA proteins involved in lipid metabolism, lysosomalactivity and autophagic processes disturb iron metabolism remains poorly understood. Thanks to whole exome sequencing in patients with NBIA we identi ï¬ed mutations inREPS1 gene that allowed us to better understand iron homeostasis deregulation in NBIA. REPS1 is involved in endocytosis of membrane receptors, including transferrinreceptor (TfR1) and vesicle transport. Studying ï¬broblast cells lines from subjects carrying biallelic mutations in REPS1 and known genes ( PANK2, PLA2G6, C19ORF12 andFA2H ), we ascribe iron overload to abnormal recycling of TfR1 and reduction of TfR1 palmitoylation in NBIA. Moreover, we describe palmitoylation as a hitherto unre ported level of post translational TfR1 regulation. A widely used antimalarial agent, artesunate, rescued abnormal TfR1palmitoylation in cultured ï¬broblasts of NBIA subjects. These observations suggest therapeutic strategies aimed at targeting impaired TfR1 recycling and palmitoylation in NBIA for which no therapy is yet available. A. RÃ¶tig: None. E10 Genetics of infertility",2018
28972,"""Mario Serio""; University of Florence, Florence, Italy Couple infertility concerns 15% of couples and male reproductive anomalies are present in about half of the cases, either as the main reason or as a cofactor. Male infertility is a multifactorial complex pathological conditionin which genetic factors play a relevant role. Azoospermic men are at highest risk for being carriers of a genetic anomaly (25%).The genetic landscape of this condition ishighly complex as semen and testis histology phenotypes are extremely heterogeneous and at least 2,000 genes are involved in spermatogenesis (Krausz et al. 2015). Knowngenetic factors can be screened in all etiologic categories of male infertility (hypothalamic pituitary axis dysfunction, quantitative and qualitative alterations of spermatogenesis,ductal obstruction/dysfunction). Genetic testing is relevant for its diagnostic value and clinical decision making and for appropriate genetic counselling (Krausz et al. 2018).Anomalies in sex chromosomes have major role in severe spermatogenic impairment: i) Y chromosome microdele tions (AZF deletions) are the most frequent moleculargenetic causes of severe oligo/azoospermia. Carriers of complete AZFa and AZFb deletions have virtually zero chance for successful sperm recovery through TesticularSperm Extraction, hence this genetic test has also a pre TESE prognostic value (Krausz and Casamonti, 2017); ii) X chromosome linked, TEX11 mutations are novel causes of meiotic arrest. Over the last 20 years, two approaches have been used for the discovery of novel genetic factors: i) array based analyses (SNP and CNV); ii) exome analysis. Resultsfrom whole genome association studies suggest a marginal role for common variants as causative factors. Studies on Copy number variations (CNVs) demonstrated a con siderably higher CNV load in infertile patients compared with normozoospermic controls. This phenomenon may well be an expression of a more generalized genomicinstability, which could be one of the explanations for the epidemiological observations indicating lower life774 J. del Picchiaexpectancy and higher morbidity (including cancer) in infertile men. Recently a genetic link between late onset Fanconi Anemia due to FANCA mutations and SCOS has been identi ï¬ed which further link infertility to a cancer prone disease. Whole exome analysis has proved a highly successful diagnostic tool in patients belonging to con sanguineous families. It allowed the identi ï¬cation of novel candidate genes (mainly autosomal) for central hypogo nadism, monomorphic teratozoospermia/asthenozoos permia, congenital obstructive azoospermia and quantitative spermatogenic disturbances. Despite efforts, the aetiology of infertility remains unknown in about 40% of patients andthe discovery of novel genetic factors in idiopathic inferti lity is a major challenge for the ï¬eld of andro genetics. The large majority of idiopathic patients are affected by quan titative spermatogenic disturbances and are not familial cases (sporadic). The development of a diagnostic gene panel based on exome data originating from familial cases ishighly limited, since these are due to recessive inheritance (i.e.one mutated allele is tolerated). In sporadic cases, hemizygous mutations and heterozygous autosomal muta tions with dominant negative effect or haploinsuf ï¬ciency are the most obvious candidates. While the diagnostic interpretation of a pathogenic mutation on the sex chro mosomes is relatively easy, the causative link for a het erozygote mutation is rather complex. It is expected that ongoing, large, consortium based, whole exome and whole genome studies will accelerate the discovery of the missing genetic aetiology of idiopathic male infertility.

Establishing the consequence of these variants for humanhealth and development is a global challenge. This requires differentiating those variants that contribute to healthy variation and resilience of populations to disease from those that have adverse consequences contributing to disease and developmental disorders in individuals Whole exome and whole genome sequencing for patients with rare disease often yields novel variants that cannot be conï¬dently interpreted in isolation. DECIPHER ( https:// decipher.sanger.ac.uk ) is a node in the federated MME system. It is a major global platform for the visualization of phenotypic and genomic relationships with a mission is to map the clinically relevant elements of the genome andunderstand their contribution to human disease and development. DECIPHER has facilitated >1500 publica tions in the peer reviewed scienti ï¬c literature; a testament to the importance of match making in rare disease. Database silos inhibit diagnosis and discovery in rare disease. The 'Matchmaker Exchange (MME)' project waslaunched in 2013 to address this barrier to progress and is now a demonstration project for the Global Alliance for Genomics and Health (GA4GH). MME facilitates thematching of cases with similar phenotypic and genotypic proï¬les (matchmaking) through standardized application programming interfaces (APIs) and procedural conventionsfor the following connected databases: DECIPHER, Phenome Central, MatchBox, Patient Archive, MyGene2 and GeneMatcher. The GA4GH Matchmaker Exchangeincreases the power for discovery and diagnosis by users of its component nodes by enabling searching for matching cases in a much larger data set. H. Firth: None.

Agenesis of the corpuscallosum (ACC) corresponds to the complete or partial absence of the corpus callosum and is one of the most frequent brain malformations in humans. The incidence ofACC is 1/4,000 in newborns but rises to 3 5% in patients with intellectual disability (ID). ACC is a highlyAbstracts from the 51stEuropean Society of Human Genetics Conference: Oral. . . 775heterogeneous condition: complex ACC is commonly associated with other cerebral or extracerebral anomalies and/or variable degrees of ID. In contrast, isolated ACC has been associated with a 75% chance of a normal or sub normal developmental outcome, although speci ï¬c cognitive processes such as reasoning, verbal and social abilities maybe impaired. ACC is usually diagnosed prenatally by ultrasound from the second trimester of pregnancy. Prog nostication is dif ï¬cult due to the widely variable neurode velopmental outcomes and ACC is a relatively common cause of late pregnancy termination in European countries. ACC associated with ID is frequently caused by mutationsin genes encoding transcription factors or chromatin remodelers, such as subunits of the SWI SNF complex. On the contrary, the genetic factors responsible for isolatedACC remain poorly understood. Recently, we have shown that mutations in DCC , encoding the receptor for netrin 1, cause isolated ACC with incomplete penetrance. C. Depienne: None.",2018
28975,"Institute, Seattle, WA, United States The cerebellum is often overlooked in assessing fetuses and children with developmental brain disorders because of multiple patterns of malformation that are inconsistently deï¬ned, lack of experience in recognizing these patterns, variable severity including non penetrance, occasional co occurrence of atrophy, and limited understanding of the underlying causes. After excluding two well known groupsof autosomal recessive disorders with recognizable patterns of malformation (Joubert syndrome and pontocerebellar hypoplasia), cerebellar malformations have been con sistently observed with only two copy number variants (deletion 3q24 or 6p25.3) and a few genes (CASK, OPHN1 and FOXC1). Recent experience has shown that prenatalevents such as late 2nd early 3rd trimester posterior fossa and cerebellar bleeds and (less often) cerebellar ischemia, can cause cerebellar injuries that mimic cerebellar mal formations. Accordingly, genetic studies have shown a lower rate of abnormalities than other developmental dis orders such as agenesis of the corpus callosum, intellectual disability and autism. We have performed SNP microarrays in ~250 children and whole exome sequencing data in ~100 children with cerebellar malformations. Our analysis sug gests that cerebellar hypoplasia is a variable feature in many genetic developmental brain disorders, that prenatal injuriesto the cerebellum are common and can often be recognized based on the pattern of abnormality, and that these two processes may co occur.

Uncertainty about a child âs gender can be traumatic for the individual and their family. It may also carry profound psychological and reproductive con sequences. Most often the underlying cause of DSD is a variant in a gene or genes regulating gonadal/genital or steroidogenic pathways. Providing a molecular diagnosisfor patients with a DSD and their families can serve mul tiple purposes: naming the underlying cause contributes to acceptance, reduces stigma or blame, and provides crucialclues and guidance for clinical management, including information on the malignancy risks associated with some types of DSD. A diagnosis is integral to genetic counselingand family planning and yet it has been found that currently as few as 13% of patients with a DSD will receive a clinical molecular genetic diagnosis. To address this we have developed a massively parallel sequencing targeted DSD gene panel which allows us to sequence 64 known diagnostic DSD genes and 1000candidate genes simultaneously. Using this we have analyzed DNA from the largest reported international cohort of patients with DSD (278 patients with 46,XYDSD and 48 with 46,XX DSD). We found variants in a total of 28 diagnostic genes highlighting the genetic spectrum of this disorder. Sequencing revealed 93 previously unreportedDSD gene variants. Overall, we identi ï¬ed a likely genetic diagnosis in 43% of patients with 46,XY DSD. In patients with 46,XY disorders of androgen synthesis and action thegenetic diagnosis rate reached 60%. Surprisingly, little difference in diagnostic rate was observed between singletons and trios. In many cases our ï¬ndings were informative as to the likely cause of the DSD, which will facilitate clinical management. The clinical utility of this targeted DSD genetic screen will be discussed as will theadditional approaches we are taking to ï¬ll the diagnostic gaps that still exist.776 J. del PicchiaA.

28977,"The nuclear receptor (NR) superfamily plays a crucial role in development as well as diverse aspects of endocrine,reproductive, neurological and metabolic function. Humans have 48 nuclear receptors and to date, de ï¬ned conditions have been reported for almost half of them. Initially, phe notypes were predicted based on the known physiology of classic ligand dependent NRs (e.g thyroid receptor beta, vitamin D receptor, androgen receptor, estrogen receptor,mineralocorticoid receptor and glucocorticoid receptor). Subsequently, defects in âorphan ânuclear receptors were found based on genetic mapping strategies or phenotypespredicted from expression/mouse models (e.g. DAX 1/ NR0B1, SF 1/NR5A1, PPAR gamma, FXR alpha). More recently, exome/genome sequencing has uncovered novelNR associated conditions that would not immediately be predicted clinically (e.g. COUP TFI & II, ROR gamma). In this educational session I will provide an overview of the clinical features, inheritance and biology of nuclear receptor gene mutations with a focus on genes involved in reproductive and adrenal development and function: 1) Classic ligand dependent NRs . This includes the role of the a) androgen receptor (NR3C4) in complete and partial androgen insensitivity syndrome (AIS) (OMIM:300068, 312300), as well as CAG trinucleotide repeats in X linked spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (313200); b) estrogen receptor alpha (ESR1/NR3A1) in estrogen resis tance (615363); c) glucocorticoid receptor (NR3C1) in glucocorticoid resistance (615962); and d) mineralocorti coid receptor (NR3C2) in pseudohypoaldosteronism type I(177735). 2) Orphan NRs . This includes a) DAX 1/NR0B1 in X linked adrenal hypoplasia (with hypogonadotropic hypogo nadism and infertility) (OMIM: 300200); and b) steroido genic factor 1 (SF 1)/NR5A1 in combined adrenal/gonadal dysgenesis (612965) (rare), reproductive anomalies in 46,XY individuals (DSD, hypospadias, male factor infertility) (612965, 613957) (common) or primary ovarian insuf ï¬ ciency (POI) in 46,XX women (612964). 3) Recent discoveries . The role of a) SF 1/NR5A1 (617480) in (ovo)testis development (46,XX); b) COUPTF II/NR2F2 in (ovo)testicular development (46,XX) withcardiac defects; and c) estrogen receptor beta (ESR2/ NR3A2) in syndromic and non syndromic 46,XY DSD. Understanding the genetic basis of these conditions is important for counselling families, predicting associated features and long term history, and sometimes for persona lising approaches to management.

Objec tive: To develop polygenic risk scores (PRS) with high predictive value for complications of diabetes and for dis tinguishing patients responding to ADVANCE intensive antihypertensive therapy.778 J. del PicchiaMethods: Genetic variants of diabetes complications were selected from GWAS publically available catalog. PRS were generated by weighting risk alleles by their effect size. Results: A genetic model composed of 620 SNPs, sex, age and geno ethnicity had an area under the curve of thereceiver operating characteristics of 0.72 for cardiovascular death in 4098 Caucasian of ADVANCE, comparable to ADVANCE clinical score of 0.70 and exceeding Framing ham risk engine. When individuals were divided into tertiles of genetic risk, a signi ï¬cant gradient for incident and prevalent outcomes was demonstrated from 1.55 for heartfailure to over 3 fold for macroalbuminuria, myocardial infarction and stroke. For events such as albuminuria and cardiovascular death, ADVANCE blood pressure medica tion could be administered as preventive measure in the highest tertile of genetic risk model. Cox cumulative hazard plots revealed that individuals with the highest genetic riskhad a decrease in mortality by ADVANCE anti hypertensive treatment, persisting in ADVANCE ON post trial observation.

While the follow up of the full cohort is underway, we here report prospective results for 1,022 subjects. When reassessed by an e questionnaire and a clinical visit 1.5 years after the baseline 88.4% of participants said that their personal risk information had inspired them to takebetter care of their health. 13.7% had achieved sustained weight loss ( 3 kg) and 17.0% of smokers had quit smoking compared to 4% annual cessation rate in the generalpopulation.

The mitochondrial m.1555A>G variant,with a prevalence of 1 in 500, predisposes to ototoxicity after aminoglycoside administration. This relationship is particularly profound in early childhood, with a single dosecausing irreversible profound sensorineural hearing loss. Current genetic testing can take 3 days, an unacceptable delay in the acute setting. We aimed to develop a point ofcare test (POCT) to identify the variant in a clinically relevant timeframe. Methods: We used a Genedrive Â®POCT platform to genotype m.1555A>G.

Protein losing enteropathy (PLE) manifests as hypoalbuminemia, edema, and malabsorption due tointestinal or lymphatic disruption. We studied an extended consanguineous Muslim Arab family comprising of six patients diagnosed with PLE and hypercoagulability. Methods . Whole exome sequencing (WES) was per formed on three patients and a healthy mother. Flow cytometry was used to test for CD55 and complementoveractivation. Three patients were treated by off label compassionate eculizumab therapy, a humanized anti C5 monoclonal antibody. Results . WES analysis revealed a homozygous frameshift variant in CD55 (c.43del; p. Leu15Serfs*46), supported by two point LOD score of 4.43 and co segregation analysis inthe extended family (n ,32). Absence of CD55 was conï¬rmed by ï¬ow cytometry. Furthermore, membrane attack complex (MAC) and iC3b depositions on WBCswere signi ï¬cantly increased in patients compared to age matched controls (p < 0.001). Signi ï¬cant clinical and laboratory improvement was observed in patients treatedwith eculizumab, including resolution of diarrhea, normal ization of serum albumin, and 60% reduction in MAC deposition on WBCs within two months, and furtherimprovement within a year. Discussion .CD55 encodes a membrane bound comple ment regulatory protein that inhibits the C3/C5 convertasesand protects cells against complement induced self injury. The genetic ï¬ndings and evidence of abnormal complement activation prompted successful off label compassionatetherapy with eculizumab, a terminal complement inhibitor. The treatment led to rapid improvement and ultimately achieved complete amelioration of symptoms in threetreated patients. This path from genetic analysis to tailored therapy warrants studying the roles of complement and CD55 in other intestinal disorders that may bene ï¬t from similar treatment. A. Kurolap: E.

We aim to con ï¬rm and test the func tional role of rs7298096, a polymorphism located upstream to the NINJ2 (nerve injury induced protein 2) gene in a putative enhancer region, in the clinical response to IFN Î²in Multiple Sclerosis (MS). Materials : a total of 928 IFN Î² treated MS patients have been recruited across 4 centers in Italy, Spain and Australia. We also run eQTL analysis between rs7298096 and NINJ2 expression using available GTEx data and GEO datasets, and we performed a luciferase reporter assay. Results : an association between rs7298096 Gand time to ï¬rst relapse (TTFR) after drug start was observed in the Italian discovery cohort (P discovery ,0.032) and con ï¬rmed in two additional cohorts (P replication ,0.031 and 0.025), with rs7298096 Gbeing associated with a longer TTFR (Pmeta analysis ,2x10 4; HR: 1.51). Furthermore, we discovered that the SNP has an eQTL effect on NINJ2 expression in whole blood (P ,7.0x10 6) according toGTEx data, and it is able to modulate gene expression in vitro using a luciferase assay (P < 0.01). Conclusions : This study validates the role of rs7298096 in the clinical response to IFN Î²in MS patients. Ex vivo and in vitro experiments suggests that the SNP is able to inï¬uence the expression of NINJ2, an adhesion molecule involved in in ï¬ammation and endothelial cell activation, supporting its role in relapse occurrence and in ï¬ammatory activity in MS.

The number of young diagnosed with narcolepsy rose sharply in Sweden following vaccination with Pandemrixagainst swine in ï¬uenza 2009 2010. The most frequent form, narcolepsy type I, is caused by a loss of hypocretin neurons, and is strongly associated with HLA DQB1*0602 . However, only 0.02% of HLA DQB1*0602 carriers devel oped narcolepsy following vaccination, and it is probable that a combination of other genetic and external risk factorsare required. Method : 43 adjudicated cases of Pandemrix induced narcolepsy from the Swedish adverse drug reaction biobankSwedegene were compared with 4891 controls from TwinGene. Genotyping was performed on Illumina arrays. The merged dataset contained 600K single nucleotidepolymorphisms (SNPs), and after phasing and imputation 8.6 million SNPs. We corrected for principal components 1 4. The genome wide signi ï¬cance p value threshold was set to p < 5x10 8. Results: Pandemrix induced narcolepsy was signi ï¬cantly associated with HLA DQB1*0602 , odds ratio (OR) 6.4 [95% con ï¬dence interval (CI) 4.2, 9.8], p ,1.4x10 17.

Conclusion: We found an association with the non coding RNA gene GDNF AS1 , which is located head to head with GDNF and potentially regulates this gene. GDNF encodes an essential neurotrophic factor that supportsneuronal survival and has been associated with Alzheimer âs disease. This ï¬nding may increase the understanding of disease mechanisms underlying narcolepsy.

Glis1 3 play critical roles in the regulation of a number of physiological processes and, todate, mutations in GLIS2 andGLIS3 have been implicated in human pathologies (nephronophthisis, an autosomal recessive cystic kidney disease; neonatal diabetes andcongenital hypothyroidism, respectively). The role of GLIS1 in human embryogenesis and disease is unknown,and its function is still poorly understood. We performed whole exome sequencing in two unrelated families, each with two affected siblings, and identi ï¬ed ultra rare, reces sive missense mutations in GLIS1 that segregate with dis ease. The variations modi ï¬ed highly conserved amino acids and were predicted to be deleterious by 3 different bioin formatics tools. Comparison of the clinical features of the four individuals harboring GLIS1 mutations shows pheno typic overlap, including IUGR, arthrogryposis, short ribs,vertebral anomalies, and microretrognathia and microstomia as the predominant craniofacial dysmorphisms. Notably, individuals in these two families display a different degreeof severity: lethal (resembling the Crane Heise syndrome) and non lethal (similar to Bhoring Opitz syndromes), respectively. To establish the relevance of GLIS1 loss of function to disease, we have developed F0 glis1 zebra ï¬sh mutants and transient loss of function models. These ani mals display signi ï¬cant defects in craniofacial cartilage patterning in comparison to controls. Together, our clinical and genetic ï¬ndings as well our preliminary modeling stu dies, indicate a likely role for GLIS1 in early developmental processes in humans, and potentially represent differing aspects of an allelic spectrum of severity.

Small for gestational age (SGA) birth is associated with adult metabolic syndrome but relevance toSRS (a cause of SGA) is unclear. Educational attainment in adults with SRS has not been assessed. We, therefore, sought to determine the phenotype, cardio metabolic pro ï¬le and academic attainment in adults with SRS and propose a scoring system. Methods: UK participants aged â¥18 years with SRS were invited to a study appointment involving a medical history, clinical examination and investigations. Results: 33 individuals (18 females) aged 13.32 69.71 years (median 29.58) were recruited. Loss of methylation at H19/IGF2 was diagnosed in 81.8%; maternal unipar ental disomy for chromosome 7 in 18.2%. Median heightstandard deviation score (SDS) was 2.67; weight SDS 1.72; body mass index SDS 0.53; and head circumfer ence SDS 0.95. Short stature (height SDS â¤ 2) was present in 60.6%. Asymmetry and relative macrocephaly were present in 66.7% and 57.6% respectively. Con genital anomalies were present in 45.5%. In those agedâ¥18 years (n ,25), GCSEs were gained by 84%; university degrees by 48%. Type 2 diabetes mellitus (n ,3), hypertension (n ,2), and hypercholesterolaemia (n ,2) were observed. Conclusions: the clinical features show similarities and differences to childhood reports suggesting a change overtime. Educational attainment in this cohort is above the UK average but cardio metabolic pr oblems appear similar. We will propose a system for targeting epigenetic testing in adults withshort stature.

While BG dysfunction is observed in many neurodegenerative or metabolic dis orders, congenital malformations are rare. Dysplastic BG are typical of tubulinopathies but their agenesis/marked hypoplasia has never been reported to date. Material and methods: We ascertained two unrelated sporadic girls presenting with spastic tetraparesis and severe intellectual impairment, sharing a unique malformationcharacterized by agenesis/hypoplasia of BG (mainly puta men and globus pallidus) and olfactory bulbs, and hypothalamic mesencephalic fusion. WES identi ï¬ed two novel homozygous variants, c.26C> A (p. Ser9*) and c.752A> G (p. Gln251Arg) in the GSX2 gene, a member of the family of homeobox transcription factors, which arekey regulators of embryonic development. GSX2 is selectively expressed in the lateral ganglionic eminence, a protrusion of the ventral telencephalon from which, alongwith the medial ganglionic eminence, the BG and olfactory tubercles originate. Results: The truncating variant resulted in complete loss of protein expression. The missense variant affects a highly conserved residue of the homeobox domain (HD) and is consistently predict ed as pathogenic. Molecular dynamics showed impaired HD structural stability and weaker interaction with DNA. Expression studies on both patients âï¬broblasts demonstrated reduced expres sion of GSX2 itself, likely due to a ltered transcriptional self regulation, as well as signi ï¬cant expression changes of target genes ASCL1 (downregulated) and PAX6 (upregulated). Conclusions: We report for the ï¬rst time the clinical phenotype and molecular basis associated to BG agenesis inhumans. Funding: ERC Starting Grant 260888; Ricerca Finalizzata NET 2013 02356160. R.

To identify new molecular components of this system, we performed a systematic genetic interrogation via whole exome sequencing of families with isolated GnRHdeï¬ciency (IGD). We report 10 families with an anosmic form of IGD (Kallmann Syndrome; [KS]) harboring auto somal dominant loss of function mutations in TCF12 ,a transcription factor also known to cause syndromic cranio synostosis. We observed no distinction in mutation localiza tion on the TCF12 locus for KS versus the reported craniosynostosis alleles. Additionally, 3/10 families display both KS and craniosynostosis indicating that allelism at the driver gene alone is insuf ï¬cient to explain the phenotypic variability. To dissect this phenomenon further, we show that loss of tcf12 in zebra ï¬sh perturbs GnRH neuronal patterning with concomitant attenuation of the expression of severalpotentially downstream genes that are both mutated in other syndromic forms of IGD and map to a TCF12 af ï¬nitynetwork. Finally, rescue of tcf12 loss of function GnRH phenotypes was achieved by mRNA corresponding to one of these loci, STUB1 . In addition to extending the rapidly evolving genetic architecture of IGD, these studies begin to assemble one of the functional networks that regulate the ontogeny of GnRH neurons and potentially modulate phe notype. These ï¬ndings also highlight an emerging class of pleiotropic genes including FGFR1, SMCHD1, CHD7 ,a n d now TCF12 that contribute to both IGD and distinct cranio facial abnormalities.

Silversides4 1Toronto General Hospital, Toronto, ON, Canada,2Centre for Addiction and Mental Health, Toronto, ON, Canada, 3University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada,4University Health Network, Toronto, ON, Canada Background: Relatively little is known about late outcomes in genomic disorders. Elevated risk of premature death hasbeen reported for 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11.2DS), however the effect of key 22q11.2DS associated features on all cause mortality is unknown. Methods: We studied 1265 adults ( â¥17 years): 290 with 22q11.2DS (135 male; median age 29.7, range 17.8 68.6, years), their 444 unaffected siblings and 531 unaffectedparents, followed for up to 23 years. We compared survival between groups using Kaplan Meier estimates and Cox regression (hazard ratio (HR) and 95% con ï¬dence interval (CI)) to investigate the relationship between all cause mortality and potential predictor variables including major congenital heart defects (CHD), psychotic illness, andintellectual disability. Results: Adults with 22q11.2DS had lower (p < 0.0001) survival than unaffected siblings or parents. The 22q11.2deletion (HR 10.3, 95% CI 3.2 32.5) and major CHD (HR 4.7, 95% CI 2.1 10.6) were signi ï¬cant predictors of784 J. del Picchiamortality. Within 22q11.2DS, major CHD (HR 3.0, 95% CI 1.2 7.5) remained a signi ï¬cant risk predictor when control ling for other factors. There were 31 (10.7%; 13 M) deaths of individuals with 22q11.2DS at median age 46.4 (range 18.1 68.6) years. Conclusions: Individuals with 22q11.2DS who survive childhood have diminished life expectancy, attributable largely to the 22q11.2 deletion, with major CHD as an additional signi ï¬cant contributor. Median age at death was nearly 5 years older than when examined ~10 years ago in a smaller cohort. A substantial minority of patients outlive both parents.

Patients with CFC syndrome also commonly show gastrointestinal dysfunction, including feeding and swallowing dif ï¬culties and gastroesophageal reï¬ux. We have previously found that knock in mice expressing a Braf Q241R mutation exhibit CFC syndrome related phenotypes, such as growth retardation, craniofacialdysmorphisms, congenital heart defects, learning de ï¬cits and ectodermal abnormalities. However, it remains unclear whether Braf Q241R /+mice exhibit gastrointestinal dysfunc tion. Here, we report that BrafQ241R /+mice have neonatal feeding dif ï¬culties and esophageal dilation. The esophagus tissues from BrafQ241R /+mice displayed incomplete repla cement of smooth muscle with skeletal muscle and decreased contraction response to carbachol, an acetylcho line receptor agonist. In contrast, achalasia like loss ofneuronal cells was not observed in the lower esophageal sphincter. The Braf Q241R /+mice also showed epithelialhyperplasia, hyperkeratosis and a thickened muscle layer in the forestomach, showing the increased expression of genes related to cell adhesion, epithelium development and kera tin. Treatment with MEK inhibitors, including PD0325901, MEK162 and AZD6244, partly ameliorated the growth retardation, esophageal dilation, hyperkeratosis and thick ened muscle layer in the forestomach in Braf Q241R /+mice. The esophageal dilation and aberrant skeletal smooth muscle boundary were ameliorated in BrafQ241R /+mice treated with the histone H3K27 demethylase inhibitor, GSK J4. Our results provide clues to elucidate the patho genesis and possible treatment of gastrointestinal dysfunc tion and failure to thrive in patients with CFC syndrome. S. Inoue: None. S.

Both host genetics and microbiome features were associated with host metabolism. 54 bacterial pathways were linked to individual metabolic risk scores for CVD; these microbial effects are largely mediated by BMI, diet and in ï¬ammatory cytokines. In particular, bacterial metabolism of L methionine was consistently associated to higher level of glycoprotein N acetyls in plasma, and to atherosclerotic plaques in obese individuals. L methionine is associated tohigher metabolic risk score of CVD, higher in ï¬ammatory cytokines and lower fruit intake.

Recently novel single cell multi omics methods have been developed. Importantly, such technologies now enable us to study the diversity of cancer cell states (determined by the interplay of their genome, epigenome and transcriptome) that ariseswithin a tumor, at its most fundamental level, the cell. One example is the genome and transcriptome sequencing (G&T seq) method, where DNA and RNA of the samesingle cell can be sequenced in parallel. 480 single cells of a patient with unifocal breast cancer were sequenced and we were able to computationallyseparate and identify normal and cancer cells based on the genomic and transcriptome pro ï¬les. The single cell DNA copy number landscapes disclosed clear genetic alterationspresent in subclonal populations of cells. We identi ï¬ed biologically relevant marker genes from the transcriptomicproï¬les with genes involved in the negative regulation of apoptosis, metastasis, RET signaling and/or increasing cell motility. In addition, ERBB2 was identi ï¬ed as a marker gene in accordance with the HER2 +molecular classi ï¬ca tion of the tumor.

Stegle1 1EMBL EBI, Hinxton, United Kingdom,2Stanford University, Stanford, CA, United States,3UCSD, San Diego, CA, United States,4University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, United States Genome wide association studies have yielded a compen dium of genetic variants that are associated with human diseases. However, the majority of these variants are in intergenic region, and understanding their function remains challenging. One strategy for linking these risk variants togenes are expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) studies. To date, most large scale eQTL studies have been per formed in LCLs, blood, or post mortem collected tissues. However, disease causing variants often have tissue speciï¬c effects. To understand effects manifesting in plur ipotent and dedifferentiated cells, we mapped eQTLs in thelargest panel of human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) considered to date. Using the data collected in the i2QTL CONSORTIUM we mapped eQTLs in a set of ~1,500 iPSC lines, derived from over 1,000 donors. Gene expression was quanti ï¬ed using RNA sequencing, enabling the mapping of eQTLs togenes, exons, transcripts, splicing and UTR usage. We identi ï¬ed signi ï¬cant cis eQTLs for over 63% of expressed genes (FDR < 5%), 5% of which have not been observed inother studies. Our integrative analysis identi ï¬ed hundreds of trans acting regulatory variants, including ~100 GWAS786 J. del Picchiavariants. One example is the trans acting SNP near the transcription factor ELF2 which leads to expression changes in genes, downstream of ELF2 . Another interesting example is the observed link between a GWAS variant to atrans egene ( MED19 ), both previously implicated in prostate carcinoma, but not previously linked. This high lights the relevance of this map for cancer and pluripotency. Currently, we are including both rare and structural variants to try and make a de ï¬nitive map of cis andtrans eQTLs in iPSCs. M. J. Bonder: None. C. Smail: None. D. Jakubosky: None. C.

As part of the Human Functional Genomics Project we aim to char acterize the genetic determinants of baseline metaboliteslevels to better understand how these changes relate to the previously observed inter individual variation in immune response. We conducted a metabolite quantitative trait locus (mQTLs) mapping for 10,431 baseline metabolic featuresmeasured by three pro ï¬ling approaches (Brain Shake metabolites, general metabolites and untarget metabolites) in 500 healthy Dutch individuals. In total, we mapped >200 independent genome wide signi ï¬cant loci as being in ï¬uen tial on 1229 metabolic features. Pathway analysis on the mQTL genes show a signi ï¬cant enrichment in metabolic processes. We found 116 nonsynonymous mQTL SNPs out of which 17 SNPs show a deleterious effect on metabolic enzyme function. Interestingly, >10 mQTLs shared com mon co regulation with Crohn disease or Celiac disease. We further systematically associated these metabolites features with 9 categories âhost factors consisting of baseline immune parameters (including 73 immune cell subpopulation frequencies), molecular pro ï¬les (including transcriptome, gut microbiome) and immune response(cytokine production capacity upon stimulation). In general, metabolites show higher correlation with monocyte derived cytokines than with lymphocyte derived cytokines. Bycombining genetic markers and metabolite measurements we achieved a signi ï¬cant improvement in predicting cytokine production when compared to solely usinggenetics (p value < 0.05). In summary, this study reveals novel genetics factors regulating blood metabolite levels and highlights theimportance of baseline metabolites in immune response. X. Chu: None. M. Jaeger: None. O. B.

G. Jebsen Coeliac Disease Research Centre, Department of Immunology, University of Oslo, Oslo, Norway Blood circulating proteins are often measured as biomarkers or risk factors for various diseases, including cardiovascular disease (CVD). However, causal relationships betweenproteins and clinical phenotypes are not fully understood. Here, we used genetics as an instrumental variable and assessed causality between circulating proteins, gut micro biome, metabolic traits and complex diseases in 1,294 individuals from the LifeLines DEEP cohort, which has genetics, proteomics, gut microbiome data and over 2,000phenotypes available. In this study, we focused on 92 CVD related proteins and ï¬rst tested their association with genetic variation and microbiome. Then we performed a two directional Mende lian randomization analysis to assess causal relationships between proteins and microbiome, metabolic traits andclinical phenotypes. To do so, we constructed genetic risk scores (GRS) for 73 proteins, 42 microbial factors, over 1000 complex traits and diseases based on our dataset andpublished GWAS studies. We found 327 protein GRS associations signi ï¬cant at FDR < 0.05. The most signi ï¬cant proteins include GRN, SELE, PECAM 1 and ICAM 2,potentially relevant to CVD. Around one third of the associated GRS involve metabolic traits. We also see associations with GRS for lipids and immune cell traits. Wedetected numerous associations between GRS of proteins with microbiome and clinical traits. Our study suggests bi directional causal relationships between circulating proteins, gut microbiome and complex traits and diseases. We prioritize proteins as potential targets for therapeutic treatment if they are causal risk factors, andproteins as biomarkers to monitor disease progression if their alteration is a consequence of a speci ï¬c disease.

28995,"States Genome Wide Association Studies (GWAS) have impli cated >60 loci in the susceptibility to Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE). However, it is known that GWASonly reports genomic signals and not necessarily the precise localization of culprit genes. Chromatin conformation cap ture technologies that detect contacts between distantregions of the genome offer an opportunity to physically map disease variants to effector genes. To move beyond analyzing one locus at a time, and to improve upon the lowresolution of available Hi C datasets, we developed a massively parallel, high resolution Capture C based method to characterize the genome wide interactions of all humanpromoters in any cell type. We designed a custom Agilent SureSelect RNA library targeting DpnII restriction frag ments overlapping 36,691 promoters of protein coding,noncoding, antisense, snRNA, miRNA, snoRNA and lincRNA genes. We applied our method of SPATIaL seq (genome Scale, Promoter focused Analysis of chromaTInLooping) to primary human T follicular helper (TFH) cells from healthy tonsil, a cell type relevant to SLE. These sub 1kb datasets were intersected with ATAC seq maps of TFHopen chromatin and SLE proxy SNPs from the 63 loci, resulting in an assessment of accessible variants at 48 of these loci. Some ânearest âgenes to the sentinel SNP were supported e.g. STAT4 andIKZF3 , while at other loci more distant genes were implicated e.g. LCLAT1 at the âLBH â locus, and the master TFH transcription factor BCL6 at the âLPP TPRG1 âlocus. In conclusion, high resolution, three dimensional promoter interactions with accessible, disease associated SNPs in disease relevant tissue can connect keyvariants to relevant effector genes with high accuracy.

Genome editing requires delivery of both the Cas9 nuclease and the targeting guideRNA (gRNA). The gRNA can be generated in multiple ways. Here we compare the ef ï¬ciency of editing, the on and off target repair pro ï¬les, and the innate immune sti mulation of gRNAs delivered as a plasmid expressed single guide RNA (sgRNA), an in vitro transcribed (IVT) sgRNA, a chemically synthesized sgRNA and achemically synthesized b ipartite complex (crRNA + tracrRNA) in HEK293 cells and human primary CD34 + hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells. We show that theediting repair pro ï¬les generated from delivery of the different gRNA constructs are identical.

Vergult11Center for Medical Genetics Ghent, Ghent University, Ghent University Hospital, Ghent, Belgium,2Department of Life Sciences, Ben Gurion University of the Negev, Beer Sheva, Israel Introduction: Myocyte enhancer factor 2C (MEF2C) is a core transcription factor in neurodevelopment. MEF2C haploinsuf ï¬ciency has been associated with a Rett like syndrome, characterized by severe intellectual disability,seizures and stereotypic movements. So far, 11 deletions, eight translocations and one inversion involving 5q14.3 in Rett like patients have been described, that do not directlyaffect the MEF2C coding sequence, suggesting that dis ruption of MEF2C regulatory elements could result in this Rett like syndrome. The MEF2C regulatory network,however, is yet to be deciphered. Material & Methods: We performed Circularized Chromosome Conformation Capture (4C) sequencing andcharacterized the activity of putative, neuronal MEF2C enhancers using in vitro and in vivo enhancer assays. Results: Extensive 4C sequencing in a neuronal cell line revealed an intricate interaction network, in which the MEF2C promoter physically contacts distal putative enhancers located in the region affected in Rett likepatients. We con ï¬rmed enhancer potential for 10 out of 15 selected candidate elements using luciferase assays. Moreover, eight candidate enhancers exhibited in vivoneuronal activity in zebra ï¬sh. Six of these were active in the forebrain, of which three also displayed additional activity in speci ï¬c neurons above the eye and two in the notochord. Further, one enhancer displayed mid and hindbrain activity and one was speci ï¬cally active in the notochord. Conclusions: In summary, we have begun to unravel the complex regulatory network governing neuronal MEF2C transcription, involving multiple distal enhancers. Disrupt ing this regulatory structure is likely detrimental to normal neurodevelopment and can give rise to neurodevelopmental disorders such as Rett like syndrome. E. D'haene: None. R.

However, much less is known about their effect on the regulatory wiring of individual cells. In order to study how genetic variants can affect regulatory networks, we generated personalizedco expression networks for 45 different individuals by generating single cell RNA seq (scRNA seq) data for approximately 29.000 peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Weï¬rst validated our approach by replicating 261 cis eQTLs that were previously identi ï¬ed in bulk RNA seq data, and subsequently ascertained whether genetic variantscan also alter the co expression between genes (so called âco expression QTLs â). We identi ï¬ed several of these co expression QTLs at a false discovery rate of 0.05 andreplicated these in large bulk RNA seq datasets. For instance, we found 93 signi ï¬cant co expression QTLs for the type I diabetes (T1D) variant rs11171739. This SNPaffects the co expression between RPS26 and 93 other genes, many of which are known to be involved in mRNA translation, which suggests that this T1D variant mightdysregulate this particular pathway. In conclusion, this study shows the feasibility of using scRNA seq data for eQTL and co expression QTL analysis. With the expected growth in scRNA seq eQTL datasets in the near future, we expect many more genetic variants will be identi ï¬ed that affect the regulatory wiring within cells, and which could be used to infer personalized regulatory networks using solely genotype data.

They contain hotspots for transcrip tion factor binding sites and are considered candidate regions harboring disease related non coding mutations. However, there is lack of information about how chromatin transcriptional regulation differs between health and (car diac) disease. Here we focus on cardiac material of ahomogeneous Dutch founder cohort of genetic cardiomyo pathy due to same PLN R14del mutation as compared to controls. Materials and Methods: We performed H3K27ac ChIPseq, RNA sequencing, and 4C on several tissues/cell lines related to PLN R14del cardiomyopathy and controls. Results: Based on H3K27ac ChIPseq data, 2,107 differentially acetylated peaks and 1,302 topologically associating domains (TADs) have been detected. Using awindow of +/ 5kb from TSS, we have annotated 863 genes in their proximity. Enrichment of binding motifs related to 200 transcription factors (TFs) inside these regions havebeen found. Next, we show a correlation between H3K27ac promoter occupancy and the level of RNA expression. Furthermore, we detected a condition speci ï¬cï¬ngerprint by comparing the differentially active regions in PLN R14del to acetylation pro ï¬les of additional patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy and unrelated non ischemic cardiomyopa thy. iPSC derived cardiomyocyte cell lines of PLN R14del patient and control were used for 4C based annotation of most signi ï¬cant differentially acetylated regions. Conclusions: Integrative chromatin analysis based on H3K27ac ChIP seq, RNAseq and 4C identi ï¬es the major effector processes involved in PLN R14del end stagecardiomyopathy, including many novel candidates.

TWIST1 haploinsuf ï¬ciency during devel opment could lead to craniosynostosis and limb malformation such as Saethre Chotzen syndrome. However, the transcriptional regulatory mechanism that controlsTWIST1 expression during development is yet to be eluci date. Here, we characterized active enhancers in the TWIST1 HDAC9 locus that control transcription in the developing limb and branchial arches. Using p300 and H3K27ac ChIP seq data, we identi ï¬ed 12 enhancer candi dates encompass protein coding exons of Histone deace tyase 9 (HDAC9 ). Using zebra ï¬sh and mouse enhancer assays, we showed that 8 candidates have limb/ ï¬n and branchial arch enhancer activity that recapitulate Twist1 expression. Each enhancer showed discrete activity pattern that together compile a spatiotemporal transcriptional reg ulation of Twist1 in the developing limb/ ï¬n and branchial arches. Using 4C seq, we showed that Twist1 promoter interacts with Hdac9 exons that function as enhancers in the limb bud and branchial arch of mouse embryos at day 11.5.Alteration of these enhancers lead to Twist1 haploinsuf ï¬ ciency and polydactyly in mouse models. Furthermore, TWIST1 enhancers are regulated by limb expressed tran scription factors, including LMX1B and TFAP2 that bind and regulate their activity. Deletion of the LMX1B and TFAP2 binding sites altered TWIST1 enhancer activity. Thus, our study elucidated essential components of TWIST1 transcriptional machinery, suggesting that alteration of coding exons of HDAC9 could lead to TWIST1 hap loinsuf ï¬ciency and a similar phenotypic outcome as TWIST1 coding mutations.

29001,"CRISPR/Cas9, transcription activator like effectors (TAL) and zinc ï¬nger proteins (ZF), are emerging as remarkably potent and popular DNA targeting platforms for genome editing and transcriptional regulation (gene activation andrepression) in research applications. Here we investigated the design and development of therapeutics based on tran scriptional modulation. In particular, as experimental mod els to establish the proof of concept of transcriptional repression as therapeutic, we used a RHODOPSIN (RHO) gene gain of function mutant transgenic mouse and the pre clinical pig retina. RHO is the gene most commonly involved in the blinding disease autosomal dominant reti nitis pigmentosa (adRP). In vivo retinal gene transfer byAdeno associated virus (AAV) vectors of transcriptional repressors based on synthetic ZF DNA binding proteins with (ZF6 R) or without (ZF6 DB) canonical repressordomain, enable the complete RHO transcriptional silencing and in turn therapy in the P347S mouse model of RHO adRP. In addition, we showed that the AAV mediatedectopic expression of the endogenous transcription factor (TF) KLF15 similarly generate robust RHO silencing. In the pig retina, comparison of speci ï¬city by RNA sequencing, showed that ZF6 R and ZF6 DB perturbed 220 and 19 differentially expressed genes (DEGs), respectively. Sur prisingly, the endogenous ectopic expression of the TFKLF15, showed similar high selectivity with 156 DEGs and therefore a safe pro ï¬le. Ef ï¬cacy assessed by retinal func tional analysis in the adRP mouse model, show remarkableprevention of retinal degeneration. Collectively, these data support transcriptional modulation as a novel paradigm to generate transcriptional based therapeutics for the treatmentof human inherited disorders by gene therapy supporting their use in translational medicine.

Materials and Methods: Through whole exome and RNA sequencing, we studied three unrelated families, presenting at birth with congenital arthrogryposis, micro cephaly with consistent simpli ï¬ed gyral pattern and mild cerebellar hypoplasia. The only child who survived up to six years developed also anemia and diabetes. We usedelectronic microscopy (EM) and ï¬ow citometry to evaluate ultrastructural and cell cycle anomalies in patients â ï¬broblast cultures. In addition, we searched for similar cellular alterations within the Connectivity library Map from Broad Institute. Results: In all patients, we identi ï¬ed biallelic loss of function mutations in SMPD4 , encoding a putative neutral sphingomyelinase without a clearly de ï¬ned role, localized in the endoplasmic reticulum. Analyses on patients â ï¬broblasts revealed a drastic reduction of normal SMPD4 transcript levels, a dilated rough ER with aggregates ofmisfolded proteins and excess of lysosomes and late autophagic vacuoles. In addition, cell division alterations were observed. Connectivity mapping of SMPD4 deï¬cient gene expression signatures revealed highest similarity to SPHK2 knock down. SPHK2 is one of the enzymes controlling the balance between ceramide and sphingo sine 1 phosphate, which is important for regulation of cell stress response and cell growth. SMPD4 mutant patient ï¬broblasts were more sensitive to the SPHK2 inhibitor ABC294640 compared to control cells.

With a view to resol ving this diagnostic odyssey, the MYO SEQ project applied targeted whole exome sequencing (WES) to over 1,000792 J. del PicchiaEuropean patients with suspected genetic muscle disease. Here, we detail the results for those patients with a reported age at disease onset of â¤15 years ( n,470). Materials and methods: WES was performed using Illumina exome capture (38 Mb target) and a Picard based pipeline. The variant call set was uploaded onto seqr and 429 neuromuscular disease genes examined for point mutations, small indels and copy number variations (CNVs). Results: Pathogenic variants were identi ï¬ed in 59% ( n, 278) of patients across 70 genes. The average age at the time of WES diagnosis was 29 years (median 26 years,range 4 77 years).

A complete copy of DUX4 is present on 4A chromosomes, but not on the D4Z4 like repeats of chromosomes 4B or 10. Normally, the D4Z4repeat varies between 8 100 units, while in FSHD1 it is only 1 10 units. In the rare FSHD2, a combination of a 4A allele with a D4Z4 repeat size of 8 20 units and hetero zygous variants in the chromatin modi ï¬er SMCHD1 causes DUX4 derepression and disease. We identi ï¬ed FSHD2patients with unusually large 4A alleles of 21 70 D4Z4 units. Recently, in cis D4Z4 repeat duplications were described in ~2% of FSHD cases irrespective of SMCHD1 mutation status, which prompted us to investigate FSHD2 patients with unusually long D4Z4 repeats for this duplication. Materials and Methods: Genetic analysis of D4Z4 by Southern blotting and molecular combing of 251 non FSHD families, 351 FSHD1 families, 62 FSHD2 and 52 FSHD like families. Results: In 6/10 FSHD2 families with a 4A allele of 21 70 D4Z4 units, we identi ï¬ed a small D4Z4 repeat duplication associated with DUX4 expression. The duplica tion allele frequency was signi ï¬cantly higher than in typical FSHD2 families (2.0%), FSHD1 (2,3%) or non FSHDfamilies (2.6%). Interestingly, we identi ï¬ed duplication alleles in 7/52 (13.5%) FSHD like families.

29005,"Institute of Neurogenetics, Luebeck, Germany Introduction: Spastic ataxia is a clinically and genetically highly heterogeneous neurological disease. Despite a wealth of known genes causing this syndrome, many cases remain etiologically unexplained, suggesting that further geneticheterogeneity remains to be discovered. Results: Exome sequencing in a German family with two affected sisters with spastic ataxia with onset in the thirddecade of life revealed compound heterozygous variants in VPS13D [c.5409C>A [Tyr1803Ter] and c.12629C>T [Ala4210Val]) in both patients and heterozygous variantsin their unaffected parents. Sanger sequencing of cDNA revealed lower expression of the nonsense mutated allele compared to the missense mutated allele, resulting in a~50% reduction in the total mRNA level of VPS13D in the patients compared to non mutation carriers. This reduction was caused by nonsense mediated mRNA decay asdemonstrated by cycloheximide treatment in cultured cells. VPS13D encodes a large protein, paralogs of which causeAbstracts from the 51stEuropean Society of Human Genetics Conference: Oral. . . 793other neurological disorders including choreo acanthocytosis ( VPS13A ), Cohen syndrome ( VPS13B ), and Parkinsons âs disease ( VPS13C ). Since VPS13D disrup tion in Drosophila leads to mitochondrial abnormalities, we investigated mitochondrial morphology and function in patient derived ï¬broblasts. While the typical mitochondrial network of elongated organelles and branches was observed in two controls, patients âï¬broblasts showed rounded mitochondria and disrupted mitochondrial interconnectivity,which was con ï¬rmed by decreased mitochondrial GRP 75 protein levels. These structural mitochondrial changes were accompanied by a reduced ATP production rate. Conclusions: Our study demonstrated that biallelic mutations in VPS13D cause a movement disorder along the ataxia spasticity spectrum.

We observed a 14 days old newborn with primary microcephaly and diffuse polymicrogyria at MRI, and conï¬rmed at autopsy, who died of untreatable epilepsy. WES data revealed biallelic compound heterozygous mutations in TMX2 . Six similarly affected individuals from four additional unrelated families were found to havebiallelic TMX2 mutations. Thioredoxin(TRX) Related Transmembrane protein 2 (TMX2) is a putative oxidor eductase enriched at the mitochondria associated membraneof the ER and known to protect against ER stress and to regulate neuronal apoptosis. Under ER stress conditions, exchange of calcium between ER and mitochondria is impaired, which leads to mitochon drial accumulation of calcium and secondary mitochondrial OXPHOS failure. Mitochondrial energy metabolism inï¬broblasts from two unrelated patients showed de ï¬cient OXOPHOS reserve capacity (which measures mitochon drial tolerance to stress) and an increase of glycolyticactivity in basal conditions, suggesting a mechanism to compensate bioenergetics defect. We hypothesize that mutations in TMX2 cause defects in bioenergetics metabo lism and ER stress induced apoptosis, leading to primary microcephaly, polymicrogyria and severe neurodegenera tion. While mutations of mitochondrial thioredoxin 2(TXN2, TRX2 , OMIM #616811) and of cytosolic thior edoxin reductase 1 ( TXNRD1 , OMIM #60112) have been related to early onset neurodegeneration and epilepsy, this isto our knowledge the ï¬rst observation linking one of the ER TMX family members to abnormal neurodevelopment and secondary OXPHOS de ï¬ciency.

Here we investigated the whole genome sequence of single muscle stem cells from healthy individuals (21 79years of age) to identify age associated mutation processes and their functional consequences. Stem cell whole genome sequences were obtained from cultured single cell clones(n,29), circumventing disadvantages associated with sin gle cell sequencing. This strategy, together with functional experiments on cultured clones, allowed us to discover age speciï¬c differences and to highlight their functional rele vance in driving age related muscle decline. We show that aging affects the number of mutations and their genomedistribution. In particular, while transcribed genes of young cells were protected from mutations, old cells had lost this protection, possibly as a result of impaired transcription coupled repair. In addition, old stem cells also showed an increased non synonymous/synonymous mutation ratio compared to young cells, supporting impaired negativeselection against cells with mutations in functional regions at older ages. Using ddPCR, to detect low frequency mutations in tissue, we validated somatic mutations in themuscle bulk tissue. In summary, our results support somatic mutagenesis in muscle stem cells as a contributor to the age related decline of muscle function. I. Franco: None. A. Johansson: None. K. Olsson: None. P.

Recently,certain genes that were identi ï¬ed in hereditary cholestasis were found in families with congenital diarrhea, and vice versa ( MYO5B , explained the role of this gene in the polarization of hepatocytes and enterocytes, ABCB11 , TTC37 andSKIV2L) .Abstracts from the 51stEuropean Society of Human Genetics Conference: Oral. . . 795Materials and Methods: We used exome sequencing to study four girls from 3 separate families, aged 4 to 23 years, presenting phenotypic constellation including cholestasis, congenital diarrhea, deafness, brittle bones and learning delays, who didn't correspond to an existing diagnostic framework. Results: None of the four patients presented identical clinical signs, and mode of entry was severe congenital diarrhea with microvilli resulting in the need for long termexclusive parenteral nutrition for two patients, and choles tasis for the two others. Compound heterozygote or homozygote variants truncation or missense of theUnc 45 Myosin Chaperone A ( UNC45A) gene were identi ï¬ed in three families, which allowed researchers to group the families and describe the different expression of anewly discovered syndrome. UNC45A hadn't been pre viously associated with a condition in humans. Research on the C. elegans UNC 45 ortholog has shown the role of thisgene in motility disorders. In vitro and in vivo functional studies on a zebra ï¬sh model con ï¬rmed the involvement of UNC45A.

Symptoms include recurrent respiratory tract infections, laterality defects and adult subfertility. Disease causing mutations have been identi ï¬ed in 37 genes that still only account for around 70% of cases, with additional genes still to be identi ï¬ed. Subjects and Methods : 175 unrelated families from various ethnicities were recruited. We screened patients for mutations using a multi gene panel including all the known PCD genes and other potential candidates. All prioritizedvariants were con ï¬rmed in the affected individuals and segregated in available family members using Sanger sequencing. To functional characterize novel candidategenes, we analysed mutated cilia structure and the consequences of gene silencing in the unicellular aquatic ciliate, Paramecium . Results: We identi ï¬ed 167 disease causing variants in known PCD genes in 128 families (79%), revealing striking population strati ï¬cation and high impact recurrent alleles. 50% of mutations were not previously reported. Variants in candidate genes not previously linked to PCD were identi ï¬ed in 14 families. Mutational modelling in Para mecium and other functional characterization of the novel C11orf70 andDNAH9 genes con ï¬rmed their role in dynein related cilia motility, showing that loss of function muta tions lead to ultrastructural ciliary defects and consequent motile cilia dysfunction. Conclusions: Targeted NGS yields a high success rate for PCD diagnosis, overcoming pitfalls of other diagnostic measures. It reveals clinically important mutation strati ï¬ca tion and valuable potential for novel gene discovery. Genesilencing in Paramecium is effective for modelling the involvement of novel candidate genes in PCD. M. R. Fassad: None. A. Shoemark: None. J. Hayward: None. M. Patel: None. P. le Borgne: None. F.

Materials and Methods: We established a secondary culture of human urine derived renal epithelial cells (hURECs) from a boy aged 14 years with a Joubert syndrome phenotype caused by a homozygous nonsensemutation in exon 41 of CEP290 . These cells were treated with a morpholino antisense oligonucleotide designed to induce targeted in frame skipping of CEP290 exon 41 (ex41 CEP290 MO). A Cep290 LacZ/LacZgene trap mouse that displays a mild cystic kidney phenotype was used to study in vivo delivery following tail vein injection of anoctaguanidine dendrimer modi ï¬ed morpholino oligonucleo tide designed to splice out the LacZ gene trap (vivo LacZ MO). Results: When compared to healthy control, primary cilia of patient âs hURECs appeared tortuous and abnormally extended in length. A similar ciliary phenotype wasobserved in cystic epithelia of Cep290 LacZ/LacZmouse. Treatment of patient âs hURECs with ex41 CEP290 MO led to a rescue of ciliary phenotype. In vivo delivery of vivo LacZ MO to Cep290 LacZ/LacZmice resulted in wild type mRNA transcripts and rescue of Cep290 protein expression in renal tissue. Consistent with this was the observed rescueof both the ciliary length and the cystic kidney disease phenotype in vivo. Conclusions: These data support the feasibility of personalised approaches of induced exon skipping to treating cystic kidney disease secondary to CEP290 mutations and show that intravenous delivery of morpho lino oligonucleotide to murine renal tissue is ef ï¬cacious.

29011,"University Medical Center Groningen, Groningen, Netherlands Introduction: Crohn âs disease (CD) is a chronic intestinal inï¬ammatory disorder, for which 200 genetic risk loci are known. CD risk loci are enriched for genes involved in T cell signaling. Characterization of mucosal T cells in a disease and tissue speci ï¬c context at a single cell resolution is crucial to get insight in the underlying pathomechanisms of CD. We used single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA seq) of T cells toincrease insight in CD pathomechanisms and to identify potential novel drug targets. Methods: We performed scRNA seq of 5,292 CD3 +T cells from peripheral blood (PBL) and from ileal mucosal biopsies of CD patients. Biopsies were dissociated into T cells from the epithelium (IEL) and the lamina propria (LPL).scRNA seq was performed with an adapted SmartSeq2 protocol, using 3 â end library generation and unique molecular identi ï¬ers, sequenced on the Illumina NextSeq500. Results: Cytotoxic T cells (CTL) dominated the IEL, while Th17 cells were the largest population in the LPL. PBLs were mainly composed of quiescent T cells. Th17cells and CTLs show the highest proportion of differentially expressed known CD risk genes. The biological Etrolizu mab, but not Vedolizumab, speci ï¬cally appears to target mucosal CTLs. Two potential drug repositioning targets for mucosal Th17 cells, are MSX 122, an anti tumor CXCR4 antagonist, and Rivenprost, which targets PTGER4 , and has been tested in UC patients. Conclusion: We have conducted the ï¬rst detailed transcriptomic characterization of disease and tissue speciï¬c effector cells in Crohn âs disease. We show that CD risk genes are signi ï¬cantly overexpressed in ileal mucosal Th17 and CTLs and provide promising targets forfuture cell speci ï¬c therapies in CD patients. M. D. Voskuil: None. W.

We assembled published and de novo genome wide association studies of estimated glomerular ï¬ltration rate (eGFR), a measure of kidney function used to de ï¬ne CKD, in up to 192,346 individuals of diverse ancestry. We identi ï¬ed 56 loci attaining genome wide signi ï¬cant evidence of asso ciation with eGFR ( p< 5x10 8), including 10 mapping outside those previously reported for kidney function. Across loci, we identi ï¬ed 78 distinct association signals at locus wide signi ï¬cance ( p<1 0 5), including four in the region mapping to SLC22A2 . Allelic effects on eGFR of index variants were consistent across populations, with noevidence of heterogeneity due to ancestry ( p HET< 6.4x10 4, Bonferroni correction). Integration with genomic annotation revealed that eGFR association signals were jointly enri ched in coding sequence, and binding sites for ATF3 and HDAC8. ATF3 expression has been shown to be elevated798 J. del Picchiain animal models of proteinuria and diabetic nephropathy, whilst class I histone deacetylases (including HDAC8) are required for embryonic kidney gene expression, growth and differentiation.

Patients accepted undergo comprehensive clinical evaluation and phenotyping. Qua lifying patients receive either whole exome sequencing atBaylor or whole genome sequencing at HudsonAlpha. Of 300 WGS cases analyzed, 88.9% had received prior genetic testing (WES ,78.1%, other ,10.8%). Primary Findings were for 51% of the analyzed genomes and for 49% of cases with an existing WES. Secondary ï¬ndings were reported, for adults only, in 28% of cases. A wealth of new infor mation (gene discovery, disease phenotype expansion, etc.) has become available since 2015.

However, most standard sequencing technologiesdo not readily provide phase, that is, assigning variants to individual haplotypes. The absence of phase information particularly complicates the identi ï¬cation of compound heterozygous variants in the diagnosis of recessive dis orders, where mutations of both copies of a given gene are necessary to develop disease. While the phase of commonvariants can be accurately inferred using imputation, phas ing rare variants is challenging, especially from exome sequencing due to the sparse coverage of each haplotype. Here, we leverage large scale whole exome sequencing data from the genome aggregation database (gnomAD) which contains 123,136 individuals, to infer haplotypefrequencies between pairs of rare variants (allele frequency < 1%) located in the same gene. We demonstrate that these frequencies can be used to infer compound heterozygotestatus for variants within a gene with high accuracy (92.3%) from whole exome sequencing data using 1,494 trios for which true phase can be determined by allele transmission. Notably our approach performs very well even with a single observation of each allele in gnomAD (allele frequency ~10 5). Applying our approach to the 123,136 individuals in gnomAD, we compare the burden of rare protein altering compound heterozygous variants and homozygous variantsin each gene. We show the clinical utility of our method when applied to several rare disease cases where we could either exclude or prioritize putative causative compoundheterozygous variants (validated by sequencing the pro band âs parents).L.

Sequencing has been r e d u c e dt o~ 1 0d a y so na v e r a g e , bioinformatics and var iant interpretation takes ~3 days and clinical con ï¬rmation and NHS reporting takes <7 days. A likely diagnosis was reported in 15% of cases, including encephalopathies, myopathies, skeletal dyspl asias and rare syndromes. Despite extensive phenotyping (~17 HPO terms/proband), a third of reported cases showed 2 or fewer terms over lapping known gene terms. Preliminary ï¬ndings of the NGC Project show feasibility of implementing rapid turnaround WGS within an NHS clinical practice context. They highlight i) the utility of WGS that does not rely ongene panels; ii) the ability to diagnose diseases earlier increases the phenotypic spectrum and iii) fewer features may present early for some conditions.

29019,"Introduction: Studies have shown that rapid whole genome sequencing (rWGS) in neonatal intensive care units hasresulted in reduced time to diagnosis and improved diag nostic rates compared to the current standard of care. Children with illness, often due to genetic disease, represent70% of healthcare costs. Thus, this testing holds potential to impact healthcare economics worldwide. We sought to investigate the clinical utility of rWGS in infant inpatients atRady Children âs Hospital. Methods: After parental consent, blood samples were collected from patients and parents when available. DNAwas isolated, PCR free Illumina genomic library prepara tion was performed, and Illumina WGS was undertaken to ~45X coverage. Phenotypic features of the proband weretranslated into Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) terms. Results: After 12 months of testing, 94% of families approached enrolled. rWGS was interpreted in 340 families,yielding diagnostic information in 115 families (~34%). On average, diagnosis occurred within 96 hours (fastest 37 hours). Changes in management as a result of diagnosiswere identi ï¬ed in 77 families (~67% of diagnosed patients). The changes in management ranged from speci ï¬c, changes in surgical interventions, to palliative care guidance. Amongtheï¬rst 42 infants, rWGS provided over $1.3M in net cost savings over projected standard care. Conclusion: Consistent with other studies, rWGS has a high diagnostic yield and reduces time to diagnosis. This study demonstrates that early diagnosis changes acute management. rWGS improves clinical care, preventing disability and unnecessary procedures, while simulta neously reducing acute care costs among a broad cohortof quaternary childrens hospital inpatient infants.

Yet, the inter pretation of the obtained NGS data remains a huge chal lenge. Since sharing of data improves patient care and facilitates harmonizing patient reports, the Dutch genomediagnostic laboratories created a national database with connections to each of the labs for automated bi directional sharing. Data are stored separately for variant classi ï¬cations and variant frequencies, using the Open Source MOLGENIS and VARDA systems. The shared variant classi ï¬cation data is used in daily practice in each labs âNGS analysis software to improve the variant interpretation. Currently the classi ï¬ cation database contains >70,000 DNA variants in 4,500 genes of which 66% have been classi ï¬ed as (likely) benign, 18% as VUS, 14% as (likely) pathogenic and 2% unsolved. We developed a classi ï¬cation comparison tool and proce dure for the variants classi ï¬ed by multiple labs (n>10,000). There was consensus for 8828 classi ï¬cations. These valu able curated consensus data already has been shared beyond diagnostic laboratories with the HVP share database(LOVD3) and their submission to ClinVar is underway. The 1248 variants without classi ï¬cation consensus are currently under discussion. In trying to resolve these discrepancies, weencountered the limits of the 5 tier classi ï¬cation system, which is currently a mix of functional and clinical classi ï¬ cations. In 30 cases a variant had clear functional con sequences but an association with a low risk disease, which resulted in opposite classi ï¬cations. This could potentiallyAbstracts from the 51stEuropean Society of Human Genetics Conference: Oral. . . 801lead to misdiagnosis. An international discussion is pro posed to harmonize the classi ï¬cations of these variants. M. E. van Gijn: None. J. Laros: None. M. A. Swertz: None. C08 Population Genetic",2018

However, the genetic contribution to ef ï¬cient weight loss in response to dietary intervention remains unknown. Materials and Methods: We performed a GWA in two large low caloric diet intervention cohorts of obese participants: the Canadian Optifast900 Â®meal replacement program (n ,1166 obese subjects from Ottawa, LCD with Optifast 900kcal/d); and the DiOGenes clinical study (n , 789 overweight/obese subjects from eight Europeancountries, LCD with Modifast 800kcal/d). Results: To improve statistical power, we performed multi marker (gene based) analyses and took advantagesof recent development in Bayesian linear mixed effect models. Two loci close to the ANK1 and RBSG4 genes respectively were identi ï¬ed in the Canadian discovery cohort (genome wide FDR < 5%) and replicated in the DiOGenes sample (replication FDR < 5%). Joint modelling of the association signal together with large scale epigenome datasets (450 annotations) restricted further the signals to two individal SNPs : rs6981587 for the ANK1 locus and rs873822 for the RBSG4 locus. Full body knockdown in Drosophila melanogaster of the ANK1 ortholog (Ank) yielded a non lethal strain with 75% mRNA reduction, and these animals exhibitedsigniï¬cantly increased body mass ( +20%) and decreased triglyceride levels ( 23%) compared to controls. Knock down of the RBSG4 gene was not possible, as this gene is not conserved in ï¬y. Conclusions: Our results demonstrate, for the ï¬rst time, an effect of genetic variants to the ef ï¬cacy of weight loss in obese subjects and identify a role for ANK1 in weight control. A.

Moreover, the reduced number ofoffspring in individuals engaging in non heterosexual behavior (NHB) presents a Darwinian paradox: why are variants that predispose to NHB are maintained in thepopulation despite apparent selection against them? We report the results from the largest study of sexual orientation by focusing on two main phenotypes: NHB, de ï¬ned as having had at least one same sex partner (N ,28,486 cases and 469,427 controls) and number of partners in802 J. del Picchiaheterosexual individuals (NSP; N ,362,993 individuals) in a meta analysis of UK Biobank and 23andMe. We identi ï¬ed 4 and 41 loci signi ï¬cantly (P < 5x10 8) associated with NHB and NSP, respectively. 12 loci were sex differentiated and the genetic correlation between males and females was signiï¬cantly < 1 (rg ,0.67,P,4x10 14for NHB). By studying the association between signi ï¬cant loci and 2,500+GWAS results we highlighted pleiotropic effects with smoking behavior and hormone related phenotypes(e.g. balding). Genetic correlations indicated a shared genetic component between NHB and risk taking (P , 5.1x10 9), substance use (e.g. cannabis use,P ,3.6x10 6) and several psychiatric traits (e.g. schizophrenia,P , 1.1x10 4). A signi ï¬cant heritability enrichment in brain expressed genes was observed for NSP, but not for NHB. The strong genetic correlation between NHB and NSP (rg,0.47,P,9.5x10 25), which replicated in an external study of adolescents (P ,0.007), is consistent with antag onistic pleiotropy, suggesting that variants predisposing to NHB increase mating success (as measured by NSP) in heterosexuals. Overall, our results depict NHB as a com plex, heritable behavioral phenotype, partially sharing a genetic component with risk taking/substance use, partially with hormonal related phenotypes. A.

Here, we performed an eBMD GWAS in426,824 White British UK Biobank participants (55% female). Using statistical ï¬ne mapping and functional genomics, we prioritized genes for whole animal modelexperiments and focused on dishevelled associated acti vator of morphogenesis 2 ( DAAM2 ), a novel gene involved in Wnt signalling. We identi ï¬ed 1,106 conditionally independent signals ( P< 6.6 x10 9) mapping to 518 loci (301 novel) and explained 20% of the trait variance. Weprioritized 538 protein coding genes (247 novel) strongly enriched for bone cell expression and known osteoporosis drug target and bone disorder genes. We identi ï¬ed plausibly causal DAAM2 coding SNPs and therefore generated homozygous ( Daam2 / ) and heterozygous knockout mice for skeletal phenotyping with X ray microradiography,microtomography, and biomechanical testing. Daam2 / mice had non signi ï¬cant reductions in femur length, and reduced femur and vertebral bone mineral content. Struc tural trabecular and cortical bone parameters did not differ between wild type and Daam2 / mice. Strikingly, despite normal parameters, maximum load was greatly reduced inDaam2 / femurs and vertebrae (2.14 standard deviations below predicted strength), suggesting Daam2 de ï¬ciency impaired bone quality. Here, we increased the number ofassociated loci 2.5 fold, the variance explained to 20%, provided an ef ï¬cient strategy to prioritize genes, and iden tiï¬ed a novel determinant of bone quality, DAAM2 .

The rare disease arm of the100,000 genomes project will sequence ~60,000 indivi duals, analysing each genome against a set of curated gene panels; enhancing diagnostic yield from the currentknowledge base. To optimise ef ï¬ciency and reproducibility an automated, yet individualised, approach has been designed. Genomics England PanelApp ( https://panelapp. genomicsengland.co.uk ) is an international gene curation resource, which captures collective expertise; documenting gene:phenotype relationships. 170 curated gene panels areavailable for use, covering a wide range of clinical pheno types. A computer algorithm (PanelAssigner), supervised by clinicians experienced in rare disease diagnosis, prior itises genes tailored to the clinical phenotype through: (i) identifying similarities between the participant âs phenotype and HPO data models de ï¬ning a disease pre assigned to a speciï¬c gene panel (ii) identifying panels similar to a dynamically generated gene panel using participant âs HPO terms (iii) applying clinician developed rules dependent onrecruited disease category, HPO terms and age of onset.

Furthermore, variants in proteins containing PHDï¬ngers, motifs recognizing speci ï¬c histone tail modi ï¬ca tions, have been associated with several neurological and developmental delay disorders. Here, we report eight het erozygous de novo variants (one frameshift, two splice site, andï¬ve missense) in the gene encoding the BAF complex subunit double plant homeodomain ï¬nger 2 (DPF2). Affected individuals share common clinical features described in individuals with Cof ï¬n Siris syndrome, including coarse facial features, global developmentaldelay, intellectual disability, speech impairment, and hypoplasia of ï¬ngernails and toenails. All variants occurAbstracts from the 51stEuropean Society of Human Genetics Conference: Oral. . . 805within the highly conserved PHD1 and PHD2 motifs. Moreover, missense variants are situated close to zinc binding sites and are predicted to disrupt these sites. Pull down assays of recombinant proteins and histone peptides revealed that a subset of the identi ï¬ed missense variants abolish or impair DPF2 binding to unmodi ï¬ed and modi ï¬ed H3 histone tails. These results suggest an impairment of PHD ï¬nger structural integrity and cohesion and most likely an aberrant recognition of histone modi ï¬cations. Further more, the overexpression of these variants in HEK293 and COS7 cell lines was associated with the formation of nuclear aggregates and the recruitment of both wild typeDPF2 and BRG1 to these aggregates. Expression analysis of truncating variants found in the affected individuals indicated that the aberrant transcripts escape nonsense mediated decay. Altogether, we provide compelling evi dence that de novo variants in DPF2 cause Cof ï¬n Siris syndrome and propose a dominant negative mechanism ofpathogenicity. G. Vasileiou: None. S.

CHD3, a member of the CHD sub family of chromatin remodeling ATPases and subunit of theNuRD complex, has recently been shown to be speci ï¬cally involved in late neural radial migration and layer speci ï¬ cation in the developing cortex. Unlike other members of the CHD subfamily, pathogenic alterations in the CHD3 gene have not yet been implicated in a human neurodeve lopmental phenotype. Upon whole genome sequencing of acohort of children with rare speech disorders, we discovered an individual with a de novo missense variant in CHD3 . Through a genotype driven approach to identify more var iants disrupting the gene, we collected 35 individuals with de novo CHD3 mutations. The vast majority of individuals had missense mutations. These mutations showed a sig niï¬cant clustering within the characteristic ATPase/helicase domain of the encoded protein, in and around conserved SNF2 motifs. We used functional assays to demonstrate theeffect of the missense mutations on the ATPase activity and remodeling activity of the CHD3 protein.

Here we report monoallelic missense mutations affecting Lysine 91 in the histone H4 core (H4K91) in three individuals with a syndrome of growth delay, microcephalyand intellectual disability. The human genome contains ï¬fteen histone H4 genes, all differing at the nucleotide level but encoding an invariantH4 protein. RNA sequencing analysis of patient cells showed that Â±8% of H4 cDNA molecules carried the806 J. del Picchiamutated allele. Analysis of the chromatin fraction of patient ï¬broblasts by mass spectrometry revealed that 1 2% of histone H4 molecules contained the mutated residue. Expression of the H4 mutants in zebra ï¬sh embryos recapitulate the developmental anomalies seen in the patients. We show that the H4 mutations cause genomicinstability, resulting in increased apoptosis and cell cycle progression anomalies during early development. Mechan istically, our ï¬ndings indicate an important role for the ubiquitination of H4K91 in genomic stability during embryonic development.

Mutations in 11 out of 51 histone lysine methylases (KMT) and demethylases (KDM) encoding genes are known to cause autosomal dominant or X linkedhuman developmental disorders (DDs). We hypothesised that mutations in additional KMT/KDMs may cause novel DDs. Methods: Using gene attributes and variant frequencies in general populations, we prioritised KMT/KDMs as candidate genes for dominant or recessive DDs. We thensystematically interrogated databases of exome and array CGH of individuals with DDs. Results: We identi ï¬ed 22 KMT/KDMs as additional candidates for dominant DDs. We detected signi ï¬cant enrichment of de novo (DN) heterozygous or bi allelic protein truncating variants (PTVs) for speci ï¬c genes in individuals with DDs against controls. Detailed phenotyp ing of affected individuals uncovered several novel disorders. These included a range of neurodevelopmentalphenotypes caused by KMT2C or ASH1L haploinsuf ï¬ ciency and a dysmorphic overgrowth DD caused by heterozygous KMT5B PTVs. We also identi ï¬ed a recogniz able dysmorphic DD caused by bi allelic KDM5B muta tions, ï¬rst autosomal recessive syndrome in this pathway. We also expanded the phenotype spectrum of KMT2B DNPTVs. Overall, we found that pathogenic KMT/KDM mutations underlie the diagnoses in >1.5% individuals with DDs. Conclusions: Collectively, these results emphasize the signiï¬cance of histone lysine methylation in normal and abnormal human development.

Here we describe mutations in the SET gene, encoding a component of the âinhibitor of acetyltransferases âcomplex involved in transcriptional silencing, as novel cause for ID. Materials and Methods: Whole exome sequencing (WES) was used to detect mutations in the SET gene in four ID patients and in an affected mother and son. Literature revealedfour additional patients with de novo SET mutations. Results: WES identi ï¬ed three de novo loss of function (LoF) mutations and two de novo missense mutations. Besides ID the majority of patients had severe speech delay, but other clinical features were inconsistent. The mutations affected all four known alternative transcripts of the SETgene. In contrast, LoF mutations in SET are exceedingly rare in the normal population and if present they affect only one of the four SET transcripts. Conclusions: Our study identi ï¬es SET as a new component of the epigenetic regulatory modules underlying human cognitive disorders and establishes de novo muta tions in this gene as novel cause for non syndromic ID. The pivotal role of SET in neurogenesis is evident from numerous previous in vitro and animal studies. The SETprotein interacts with several proteins encoded by known autosomal dominant ID genes, i.e. EP300, CREBBP,808 J. del PicchiaSETBP1, KMT2A, RAC1 and CTCF, most of which are involved in histone modi ï¬cation.

They present organ speci ï¬c differential cells types and tissue com partmentalization. Additionally, they can be used todetect genetic alterations in patients. In this work we studied the potential of this type of culture for modeling cancer. Materials and Methods: Organoids from fresh tumor tissues of 40 patients with several types of cancer (colon (CRC), endometrial, ovary, kidney, lung, head and necksquamous cell carcinoma) were established. Tumor tissues were dissociated into functional units, seeded in Matrigel and cultured with the appropriate medium. Results: We established organoids from six types of cancer and determined their culture conditions. The cytokines needed for each cell type were different but allof them include EGF, Noggin, Y 27632 and Wnt 3A. For organoids derived from CRC, R spondin, FGF10, FGF2, prostaglandin E2, nicotinamide, A83 01 and gastrin areneeded. Organoids derived from kidney cancer, also need VEGF. Those derived from lung cancer require VEGF and progesterone and Î² estradiol are necessary for organoids derived from gynecological cancers. Conclusions: Organoids can be obtained from different cancer tissues. For their development, it is essential tochoose the right cytokines to grow them in. These cultures have shown to mimic three dimensional structure of the origin tissue and could be a perfect source to determinegenetic alterations in these patients.

Many genetic variants lead to aberrant splicing and cause genetic dis eases. One prominent technique for correcting splicing related mutations is through the use of splice switching antisense oligonuc leotides (AONs). The antisense drug Nusinersen for SMA, recently approved by the FDA, is one notable example. Cummings et al. recently identi ï¬ed a highly recurrent pathogenic splice variant (c.904+189C>T) in COL6A1 as a genetic cause of Collagen VI related dystrophies (COL6 R D). The variant, located in intron 11, leads to the inser tion of a dominantly acting pseudoexon that disrupts the gene âs critical motif. They estimate that ~25% of all cases with COL6 RD, but negative by exon sequencing are due to this mutation. This variant was found in a de novo pattern in over 30 patients, and we recently identi ï¬e di ti no u rl a bi na4y e a r old girl with COL6 RD. As part of in silico machine learning tools we are developing in our lab, we designed 16 AONs with 2 â OMe modi ï¬cations and a phosphor othioate backbone to correct the c.904 +189C>T variant. The most effective AONs were able to reduce the mutant allele by 95% in a dose dependent manner. The AONs designed in this work, as well as those designed in theindependent work by Bolduc et al., may offer a treatment for children suffering from the collagen VI like dystro phy. We expect the knowledge gained in this project to beapplicable to a wide range of splice mutations. Grant support: Thrasher Research Fund. D. Yagel: None. Y. Anikster: None. A. Veber: None. M.

It encodes a K2P channel that controls resting membrane potential and excitability of neurons. By analyzing WT, Kcnk9 KO matandKcnk9 KOhommice in a behavioral test battery during the light phase, our data shows that the absence of Kcnk9 leads to impaired working memory, reduced acoustic startle response and abnormalsensorimotor gating. Investigations of circadian rhythms revealed selectively increased locomotor activity during the dark phase in Kcnk9 KO homand, to a signi ï¬cantly smaller extent, in Kcnk9 KOmatmice compared to controls. Using Quanti ï¬cation of Allele Speci ï¬c Expression by Pyrose quencing (QUASEP) and Allele Speci ï¬c RT qPCR in wildtype (C57BL/6xCast/Ei)F1 hybrid mice, biallelic Kcnk9 expression from the repressed paternal allele (1 17% of transcripts) was observed in all analyzed brainregions and was particularly strong in the locus coeruleus (LC). Slice patch clamp recordings revealed wildtype like pacemaker activity during the dark phase in LC neuronsfrom Kcnk9 KO matbut not from Kcnk9 KOhommice, which discharged at signi ï¬cantly higher frequencies. The neuronal data are in line with the locomotor phenotype anddemonstrate the functional relevance of paternal Kcnk9 expression. Through epigenetic manipulation with CI994, a speci ï¬c histone deacetylase inhibitor, we could induce a signi ï¬cant up regulation of the paternal Kcnk9 allele in several analyzed brain regions after injections in Kcnk9 KO matmice.

CS is characterized by facial anomalies, hyper trichosis, extensive cardiac abnormalities and dilated cere bral blood vessels. CS is debilitating with no speci ï¬c therapy available. Hence, we applied a novel CrispR/Cas9 based genome editing approach to create CS zebra ï¬sh models for therapeutic drug screening. We ef ï¬ciently introduced three CS speci ï¬c point muta tions in abbc9 and kcnj8 of zebra ï¬sh by combining the CrispR/Cas9 system with a short template oligonucleotideharboring the site of mutation. To demonstrate functional validity, we performed live high speed video imaging of zebra ï¬sh heart and cardinal vein to assess cardiovascular function at 5 days post fertilization. Additionally, cerebral blood vessels were examined for dilations in live kcnj8 mutants in a Tg( kdrl:GFP ) transgenic background. Analogous to CS patients, knock in ï¬sh reveal signi ï¬ cantly enlarged ventricles with enhanced cardiac output, contractility and development of pericardial edema.

The ZRS enhancer, which regulates Shh transcription in developing limbs, is located in the intron 5 of the constitutively transcribed gene Lmbr1 and has been involved in numerous patient cases with limb malformations. Shh and the ZRS communicate through a 1Mb large stable chromatin interaction. However the mechanism facilitating this long range contact is not known yet. Using a series of CRISPR/Cas9 engineered alleles and4C seq experiments in mouse embryos, we aim to elucidate the role of the Lmbr1 constitutive transcription as well as CTCF in the establishment of the Shh ZRS chromatin interaction. Deletion of the Lmbr1 promoter abolishes the transcription over the ZRS, yet 4C seq experiments showed that the contact frequency between Shh and its enhancer remains unchanged in these embryos allowing for normal Shhexpression. In contrast, the removal of CTCF binding sites around and within the ZRS results in the emergence ofcompensatory CTCF binding sites as well as in altered 3D chromatin architecture, diminished Shh transcription and skeletal abnormalities. Our results suggest that CTCF actsto support a robust and permissive enhancer promoter interaction that ensures normal Shhexpression. This CTCF dependent regulatory mechanism provides a framework tounderstand the pathomechanism of unsolved structural variants described at the Shhlocus in patients with skeletal abnormalities. C.

Facioscapulohumeral Dystrophy (FSHD) is associated with deletion of D4Z4 repeat array below 11 units at 4q35.2. It is known that the deletion alters chromatinstructure in cis , leading to gene upregulation. Here we show a genome wide role of 4q D4Z4 array in modulating gene expression via 3D nuclear contacts. We have developed anintegrated strategy of 4q D4Z4 speci ï¬c 4C seq and chro matin segmentation analysis, showing that D4Z4 3D inter actome and chromatin states of interacting genes areimpaired in FSHD; in particular, genes which have lost the D4Z4 interaction and with a more active chromatin state are enriched for muscle atrophy signature.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a public health threat, which affects >10% adult population inWestern countries and is associated with increased risk of end stage renal disease, cardiovascular disease, and all cause mortality. In the absence of therapies for CKD pre vention, understanding the biological regulators of glo merular ï¬ltration rate (GFR), the key element that de ï¬nes CKD, is of the highest relevance. Materials and methods . Within the CKDGen Consor tium, 121 studies applied standardized protocols and scriptsto run genome wide association scans (GWAS) of estimated GFR (eGFR) on ~9 million high quality SNPs, imputed on the 1000 Genomes ph3v5 or Haplotype Reference Con sortium datasets. We performed ï¬xed effect meta analysis of GWAS data on >750,000 participants of European, East Asian, South Asian, Hispanic, and African ancestries. Effect heterogeneity due to ancestry was investigated using trans ethnic genome wide meta regression as implemented in MR MEGA. Results . Genomic in ï¬ation was negligible: lambda , 1.05 and LD score regression intercept ,1.04. Across ethnicities, we identi ï¬ed 308 1 Mb segments containing â¥1 SNP associated with eGFR (p value â¤5E 08): 228 of these loci were novel and 80 validated previously identi ï¬ed signals. Trans ethnic meta regression revealed limitedheterogeneity correlated with ancestry for most genomic regions. Approximate conditional analysis of the European ancestry dataset identi ï¬ed 269 independent variants, which together doubled the eGFR variance explained compared to previous estimates. Conclusions . This study represents the largest screen of kidney function genetic loci to date. The large number of identi ï¬ed loci will contribute to increase our understanding of kidney function âs biology. C. Pattaro: None.",2018

Nine novel ( SDC1 ,SLC8A1 ,EPHA6 ,SPATA4 ,MAGI2 , CTSB, BC014119, SMCO4 andCNTN5 ) and 32 established loci showed effects on both BMI and lipids in the jointmodel, suggesting shared genetic architecture. This obser vation was supported through hierarchical cluster analysis, which resulted in six clades representing a mixture of lipid and BMI associated variants. We detected signi ï¬cant eQTL effects in whole blood, subcutaneous/visceral fat and liver at 16 of the identi ï¬ed loci, and enrichment of association signals at HDAC6 binding sites, indicating a critical role of associated loci in various cellular events. The MP GWAS is a powerful approach to detect shared genetic effects on correlated phenotypes, as demonstrated by our analysis of lipids and BMI.

They have been successfully used to prioritize the target genes of the variants associated with complex traits and diseases (GWAS variants). Up to date a few eQTLsdatabases exist and they collect only a small portion of the available datasets. We thus planned to build the largest publically available catalog of eQTLs, coupled with a browser, to optimize and simplify their interrogation. We collected and manually curated 51 eQTL public studies ranging from 2007 to date, corresponding to more than 100 sample types and 25 human populations for atotal of 259176 cis eQTLs and 32929 genes with at least one cis eQTL (cis eGenes). Most of the eQTLs studies were conducted in blood samples from healthy individualsof European ancestry. We found that for 93% of the known protein coding genes were eGenes, 20% of them inter secting (r 2â¥0.8) with the NHGRI EBI GWAS Catalog and 26% of whom considered as druggable. Furthermore, for those GWAS variants for which an eGene was known, we found that the NHGRI EBI GWAS Catalog proposed thesame gene as candidate target only for the 60% of the times.

29044,"1University of Tartu, Tartu, Estonia,2Estonian Genome Center, Tartu, Estonia Introduction: Genetic imputation works well with frequent alleles (minor allele frequency>1%), however, its predictive accuracy drops for rare genetic variants which can also playa role for eventual development of diseases. Exceptions to such limitations are endogamous populations like Estonia. Currently, 50,000 participants of Estonian biobank havebeen genotyped, with additional 100,000 being collected within next year, and their genetic pro ï¬les will be added to electronic health records. We performed a study to predictand verify rare mutation carriers for severe disease predis positions such as familial breast cancer (in genes BRCA1 and BRCA2 ) and familial hypercholesterolemia ( APOB ) using long range haplotyping (LRH) and âsurrogate parent â theory. Materials and Methods: We used whole genome sequence data of 2,244 and genotyped data of 15,416 participants of the Estonian biobank. Whole genome814 J. del Picchiasequencing (WGS) with 30x coverage was carried out at Broad Institute using Illumina HiSeq xTen platform. Results: WGS identi ï¬ed 14, 4 and 6 mutations carriers forBRCA1 ,BRCA2 andAPOB , respectively. We identi ï¬ed 16 mutations carriers for BRCA1 and 3 for BRCA2 , and 5 carriers for APOB using LRH among genotyped samples. We failed to ï¬nd carriers for additional 6 out of 9 mutations, highlighting these as recent mutations and only present in limited historical lineages. Conclusions: LRH is a cost effective approach to predict additional rare mutation carriers for different disease predispositions from genotyped data in endogamouspopulations and will be important in the process of reporting clinically relevant mutations to Estonian biobank participants.

29045,"2University of Queensland, Brisbane, Australia Background: Genome wide association studies (GWAS) successfully exploit the variability of most abundant DNA variants, namely single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs),but frequently fail to provide information about causal mutations. Copy number variation (CNV) impacts pheno type variability and disease susceptibility and is one of thesources for the so called âmissing heritability â. Despite notable genomic effects of both CNVs and SNPs, the cor relation between them is understudied, and the role ofCNVs in SNP based phenotypic effects is not established. Methods: We estimated linkage disequilibrium (LD) between CNVs and SNPs in protein coding genes using the1000 Genomes project sequencing data (1000G) from phase 3. We de ï¬ned CNV tagging SNPs for variants reported in the GWAS catalog for disease/phenotype associations (July,2017) and for recently published DIAGRAM consortium type 2 diabetes (T2D) 1000G reference panel imputed meta analysis in Europeans (PMID:28566273). Results: We replicated established CNV tagging SNP effects at ten loci, including NEGR1, LCE3A/B, CFHR1 3 for obesity, psoriasis and nephropathy, respectively. Werevealed 31 novel CNVs (length 275bp to ~ 6kb), all but one being deletions. Among novel CNVs ï¬fteen are <1kb,tagging lead breast cancer and T2D/lupus erythematosus SNPs at CHST9 and JAZF1 loci among others. Novel CNVs covered drug target genes, such as HTR3D/C/E, PLEKHA1 ,a n d MGST1 and tagged SNPs associated with major depressive disorder, age related macular degenera tion, and visceral fat, respectively. Conclusion: This is the most detailed CNV tagging SNPs catalog to date, which will help in dissecting the functional impact of SNP trait associations and could drive thedevelopment of new drugs.

Secondary mitochondrial dysfunction was reported in several proger oid syndromes, caused by alterations in components of the nuclear envelope (Hutchinson Gilford progeria) or by impaired DNA repair (Cockayne syndrome). We present evidence that a progeroid Fontaine syndrome is caused by aprimary mitochondrial dysfunction. Four unrelated cases are reported, sharing congenitally decreased subcutaneous fat tissue and sparse hair, bonedysplasia of the skull and ï¬ngers, a distinctive face, growth retardation, and early demise. Exome sequencing showed that all carried de novo missense variant c.649C>T (p. Arg217Cys) or c.650G>A (p. Arg217His) in SLC25A24 , coding for calcium binding mitochondrial carrier protein (SCaMC 1, SLC25A24). SLC25A24 allows an electro neutral and reversible exchange of ATP Mg and phosphate between the cytosol and mitochondria, required for optimal adenine nucleotide levels in the mitochondrial matrix. Molecular dynamic simulation studies predict that p. Arg217Cys and p. Arg217His narrow the substrate cavity of the protein and disrupt transporter dynamics. SLC25A24 mutant ï¬broblasts and cells expressing p. Arg217Cys or p. Arg217His variants showed altered mitochondrial morphol ogy, a decreased proliferation rate, increased mitochondrialmembrane potential, and decreased ATP linked mitochon drial oxygen consumption. Our ï¬ndings identify SLC25A24 mutations affecting codon 217 as the underlying genetic cause of human progeroid Fontaine syndrome and suggest that the SLC25A24 mutations lead to impaired mitochondrial ATP synthesis and cause hyperpolarization and increased proton leak in association with an impaired energy metabolism. Fontaine syndrome creates a clinical spectrum with Gorlin Chaudhry Moss syndrome, which is caused by the same mutations, shares several clinical features, but has apparent normal lifespan. K.

The complexity of these disorders has so far preventedthe development of effective therapeutic strategies. Results: We demonstrate that the microRNAs miR 181a and miR 181b (miR 181a/b) regulate key genes involved inmitochondrial biogenesis and function. We also show that these miRNAs are involved in the global regulation of mitochondrial turnover in the central nervous systemthrough the simultaneous and ï¬ne tuning modulation of different gene pathways. We sought to verify whether the modulation of these miRNAs could be therapeuticallyexploited in neurodegenerative conditions associated to impaired mitochondrial activity. We show that miR 181a/b downregulation strongly protects neurons from cell deathand signi ï¬cantly ameliorates the disease phenotype in in vivo models of both primary and secondary mitochondria mediated neurodegeneration, such as Micro phthalmia with Linear Skin Lesions, Leber hereditary optic neuropathy and Parkinson âs disease. Conclusions: Altogether our results indicate that miR 181a/b act as hubs in mitochondrial homeostasis in the central nervous system and represent novel gene independent therapeutic targets for a wide range ofneurodegenerative diseases caused by mitochondrial dysfunction.

This has propelled whole exome sequencing (WES) into the clinical setting, achieving high diagnostic yields. Methods: The WES data of 1116 paediatric and adult individuals investigated under clinical and/or biochemical suspicion of mitochondrial disease and collected over a 5 year period, were systematically analysed. Each solved exome was coupled to clinical (HPO), biochemical and experimental data. Results: Genetic diagnosis was established in 446 (40%) individuals and included discovery of 40 novel diseasegenes. 345 (31%) individuals harboured pathogenic variant (s) within 122 mitochondrial disease associated genes. Defects in ACAD9, ECHS1, FBXL4 andMT ATP6 occurred most frequently. Defects in 45 of the 122 genes occurred only in single cases. 29 patients with molecularly veri ï¬ed mitochondrial disease didn ât demonstrate respiratory chain complex defects in muscle and/or ï¬broblasts. 56 diagnosed cases are amenable to treatment strategies, highlighting the importance of WES. Dif ï¬culty in mitochondrial disease deï¬nition was re ï¬ected by 101 patients harbouring disease causing variant(s) in non primarily mitochondrial disease associated genes (84 genes including TANGO2, CAD, IARS , SLC52A2 ) and 118 individuals with unsuspected but genetically proven mitochondrial disease diagnosed in the same time period. Conclusions: This study further elucidates the hetero geneous genetic landscape of mitochondrial disease, prompting careful consideration of diagnostic criteria byhighlighting discrepancies between clinical, biochemical and genetic means of diagnosis.

Their diagnosis and treatment remains challenging. The pre valence of mitochondrial disorders in India is more than the projected data available in the literature. In India, with a huge number of endogamous ethnic groups, the transmis sion rate of mitochondrial disorder is more. Materials and Methods: We used targeted exome and Sanger sequencing in 425 patients with mitochondrial disorders to identify pathogenic mutations. Abstracts from the 51stEuropean Society of Human Genetics Conference: Oral. . . 817Results: We have identi ï¬ed mutations in mtDNA and common nuclear genes in 27% of the cases. However, the majority of cases (>70%) remain genetically undeter mined. Therefore, we performed whole exome sequencing to identify novel genes responsible for mitochondrial disease. We sequenced whol e exome of 30 patients with mitochondrial disease and identi ï¬ed several novel, reported mutations and novel genes. Of the novel genes identi ï¬ed, ALKBH1/ABH1 gene mutations cause severe autosomal recessive mitochondrial disease in early adult hood; hence we have sequenced complete ALKBH1 in 275 patients with mitochondrial disease, found biallelicALKBH1 mutations in 6 patients from four different families. All mutations in a c ompound heterozygous state, disrupted the function of the gene. These mutationsshowed complete co segregation with the disease pheno type and absent in 650 control chromosomes. Knock down of ALKBH1 in zebra ï¬sh using morpholino oligonucleotides (MOs) showed severe developmental abnormalities and multiple mi tochondrial respiratory chain complex defects. Conclusion: Our study shows the usefulness of exome sequencing for identi ï¬cation of novel genetic causes of inherited mitochondrial disease. P. Arumugam: None. M. Angamuthu K.: None. S.

A disease linked to UQCRH has not yet been described. Methods: Whole exome sequencing and autozygosity mapping were performed on two male ï¬rst cousins from a consanguineous family with recurrent episodes of severeketoacidosis, excess blood ammonia and hypoglycaemia and signs of encephalopathy. Brain MRI âs showed no abnormality and between episodes health was entirelynormal. OXPHOS protein levels and complex assembly were analysed by western blot and blue native PAGE. A mouse model was created in C57BL/6N mice by deletion ofexons 2 and 3 of UQCRH . Standard full screening of the mouse phenotypes was performed. Moreover, enzymatic activity and protein expression of OXPHOS complexeswere investigated in mouse tissue. Results: A homozygous UQCRH deletion of exons 2 and 3 was detected. Cultured patients âprimary ï¬broblasts showed incomplete assembly and decreased steady state protein levels of CIII subunits and low CIII enzyme activity. The murine presentation was more severe with progressivefunctional impairment and premature death at the age of 6 8 weeks. Enzyme activity assays revealed a signi ï¬cant decrease in CIII activity in heart, brain and liver tissues. Conclusions: Here we describe the ï¬rst patients with biallelic mutations in UQCRH . Notably, biallelic variants in UQCRC2 andUQCRB , two other subunits of complex III, result in a similar episodic clinical presentation.

Cells syn thesize CoA de novo from pantothenate through ï¬ve con secutive enzymatic steps. Dysfunction of two enzymes, PANK2 and COASY, leads to Neurodegeneration withBrain Iron Accumulation. To our knowledge mutations in PPCS , another enzyme of the pathway, have so far not been associated with human diseases. Subjects and Methods: Five patients of two unrelated families presented with dilate d cardiomyopathy of varied severity and no neurodegeneration. Identi ï¬cation of variants was performed by WES; pathogenicity of identi ï¬ed mutations evaluated by functional complemen tation in yeast and modeling in Drosophila; biochemical consequences of PPCS de ï¬ciency assessed in patients' ï¬broblasts. Results: WES identi ï¬ed rare biallelic variants in PPCS . The pathogenicity of identi ï¬ed variants was assessed by functional complementation of a yeast model null for PPCS (yPPCS ). Ablation of yPPCS is lethal; yPPCS null mutants transformed with the human wild type PPCS were able to grow, whereas mutants transformed with variant carryingPPCS constructs had clear growth defects, con ï¬rming the deleterious nature of the variants. Drosophila PPCS mutants showed a signi ï¬cant increase in heart rate, heart wall shortening and arrhythmia index, and a decrease in systolic length, indicating that homozygous variants in PPCS are associated with cardiac dysfunction. Conclusions: Identi ï¬cation of biallelic variants in PPCS in individuals with cardiomyopathy, linked for the ï¬rst time CoA synthesis with a cardiac phenotype. Since CoAbiosynthesis can occur with pantethine as a source independent from PPCS, pantethine can be envisaged as therapeutic options for the patients still alive. A. Iuso: None. M. Wiersma: None. H.

However, 40% of patients remainwithout molecular diagnosis despite that fact that on aver age ~80 de novo SNVs per patients are identi ï¬ed. The sheer number of these variants, overhwhelmingly non coding,make classical functional workup strategies impractical.

All patients included were array CGH and exome negative. In total we identi ï¬ed 3,396 de novo mutations in the 50 patients. 5 de novo mutations were located in pre dicted enhancer regions based on epigenetics marks. For two of these predicted enhancers we could show positive in vivo enhancer activity in transgenic mouse reporterassays. Next we used microarray based DNA synthesis to create 230 bp oligonucleotides containing all 3,396 de novo non coding variants and the corresponding wild typesequences and perform lentivirus based MPRAs in human chondrocyte cells and primary mouse limb bud cells. We experimentally measured the cis regulatory activity of 3,396 de novo non coding mutations in a single, quantitative experiment. We identi ï¬ed 48 variants that showed sig niï¬cant differential expression of the reporter gene. The positive candidates showed up to 5 fold enrichment for ENCODE TF binding motifs indicating that the mutations are likely to change TF binding and thereby contribute to disease.

Here we tested the hypothesis that, although the genetic cause isnot known, the tissue distribution of the clinical manifes tations in GLA seems to follow a pattern of somatic mosaicism. Materials and Methods: We performed targeted high throughput sequencing on paired blood/tissue samples from 10 GLA patients. All variants detected were con ï¬rmed using at least one orthogonal method. We isolated LECs from fresh tissue samples obtained from three GLA patients that were also used for high throughput sequencing. Finallywe used a Cre loxP system in mice LECs (Prox1 CreERT2; LSL Pik3caH1047R) to characterize the effect of excessive PI3K signalling on the structure and function of lymphatics. Results: We identi ï¬ed four different mosaic PIK3CA variants in six of ten patients. The variants were detected in LMs and in LECs isolated from affected tissues. Thesesame PIK3CA variants occur in patients with PIK3CA related overgrowth spectrum and cause hyperactivation of the PI3K signalling pathway. We show that excessive PI3Ksignalling in LECs causes mice lymphatic hyperplasia, non functional vessels, and induces the formation of lymphatics in bone. Conclusions: We describe for the ï¬rst time the presence of somatic activating PIK3CA mutations in patients with GLA. This will help to better de ï¬ne the phenotypic consequences of this pathology, and has consequences in the diagnosis, monitoring and treatment of patients.

The condition is clinically characterized by loose redundant skin folds, facial characteristics, lipodystrophy, hypotonia and cardiopulmonary involvement including pneumothorax, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and aortic root dilatation. Similarly, to ATP6V02 related cutis laxa, impaired retro grade Golgi transport, glycosylation abnormalities, and a dysfunctional secretory pathway have been implicated in the pathogenesis, but the pleiotropic manifestations remainlargely unexplained.

Moreover, blood ï¬ow is severely reduced in mutants compared to hetero zygous and wild type ï¬sh. Conclusion, our zebra ï¬sh model recapitulates several important clinical features including hypotonia and cardi omyopathy. This model provides an important asset tounravel the molecular mechanism causing ATP6V1E1 related cutis laxa and to evaluate potential therapeutic strategies. L. Pottie: None. P. Sips: None. P.

Bi allelic mutations in FLNB cause SCTS in some families, while monoallelic variants in the gene encoding embryonic heavy chain myosin 3, MYH3 , have been implicated in dominantly inherited forms. Here ï¬veFLNB mutation negative cases from three families were hypothesised to have a recessive form of SCTS on account of sib recurrence. Whole Exome Sequencing (WES) showed that all ï¬ve were heterozygous for one of two splice site variants in MYH3 . Despite 3 of the 5 cases sharing two allelic haplotypes overMYH3 , no second variant could be identi ï¬ed by WES. Subsequent WGS demonstrated a variant altering a con served splice donor site in the 5 âUTR of MYH3 , a region of the gene not captured by exome capture platforms. Expanding the case cohort to 16 unsolved SCTS cases, 9 had truncating mutations transmitted by unaffected parents,with 6 inheriting the same 5 âUTR variant in trans ,a n observation at variance with the allele frequency for this variant in population databases. This variant disrupts spli cing of exons 1 3 in the 5 âUTR but is still permissive of MYH3 translational initiation, albeit with reduced ef ï¬ ciency. Although some MYH3 variants cause dominant SCTS, these data indicate that many truncating variants do not lead to the disease except when in trans with a second hypomorphic allele. These observations make geneticdiagnosis and counselling challenging in the context of simplex presentations of SCTS especially using a genotype ï¬rst methodology. S. P. Robertson: None. S.

Despite numerous loci identi ï¬ed by genome wide association studies, the effect sizes ofcommon variants are relatively small with much of the presumed genetic contribution remaining elusive. We report exome sequencing results in 209 people from 72 multi affected families with pedigree structures consistent with autosomal dominant inheritance and variable penetrance. We describe four new NS CL/P genes encoding compo nents of the p120 catenin complex (CTNND1, PLEKHA7, PLEKHA5 ) and an epithelial splicing regulator ( ESRP2 ), inaddition to CDH1 . The ï¬ndings were validated in a second cohort of 497 NS CL/P patients comprising small families and singletons. Pathogenic variants in these genes were found in 14% of multi affected families and 2% of the replication cohort of smaller families. Enriched expression of each new gene/protein in human and mouse embryonicoro palatal epithelia, demonstration of functional impact of CTNND1 andESRP2 variants, and recapitulation of the CL/ P spectrum in Ctnnd1 knockout mice support a causative role in CL/P pathogenesis. These data show that primary defects in regulators of epithelial cell adhesion are the most signiï¬cant contributors to NS CL/P identi ï¬ed to date and that inherited and de novo single gene variants explain a substantial proportion of NS CL/P. <!

Because melorheostosis occurs sporadically, somatic mutations werehypothesized, but bone tissue was not previously investi gated. Paired biopsies of affected and contralateral unaf fected bone of 15 melorheostosis patients were utilized forDNA extraction, osteoblast cultures and histology. Using WES and ddPCR, we identi ï¬ed somatic mutations in MAP2K1 , encoding the kinase MEK1, in affected, but not unaffected, bone of 8 melorheostosis patients. Mosaicism was supported by immunohistochemistry of ERK1/2 acti vation in bone tissue and two populations of culturedosteoblasts with distinct p ERK1/2 levels on ï¬ow cyto metry. These activating mutations (p. Q56P, p. K57E, p. K57N) cluster in the MEK1 negative regulatory domain. Osteoblasts from affected bone displayed increased MEK1 ERK1/2 signaling, which enhanced osteoblast proliferation and stimulated bone remodelling, while inhibiting osteo blast differentiation and bone mineralization. This coincided with the histology of melorheostosis, featuring exuberant deposition of parallel layers of lamellar bone, followed byintense bone remodelling with elevated cellularity. Melor heostosis provides the ï¬rst demonstration that the MAP2K1 oncogene is important to human bone formation. Interest ingly, germline mutations in the catalytic core of MAP2K1 and the negative regulatory domain of MAP2K1 and MAP2K2 were identi ï¬ed in Cardio Facio Cutaneous syn drome (CFC). CFC and other RASopathies are associated with variable cardiac, facial and neurodevelopmental defects, but not with bone overgrowth. Somatic MAP2K1 mutations in melorheostotic osteoblasts and others recently reported in extracranial arteriovenous malformations apparently have consequences distinct from germlinemutations. We conclude that outcomes of MAP2K1 muta tions depend on mutation timing and location. H. Kang: None. S. Jha: None. Z. Deng: None. N. Fratzl Zelman: None. W. A. Cabral: None. A. Ivovic: None. F.

Prenatal exome sequencing approaches have identi ï¬ed genetic diagnoses when conventional tests (kar yotype and microarray) were not diagnostic. However,prenatal phenotyping limitations, counselling challenges regarding variants of uncertain signi ï¬cance, incidental and secondary ï¬ndings, and technical problems pose unique challenges in the prenatal use of exome sequencing. Here we use a multidisciplinary approach to explore the utility of rapid targeted fetal exome sequencing for prenatal diag nosis, using skeletal dysplasias as an exemplar. Methods: Pregnant women who had had, or who were undergoing, an invasive procedure to exclude chromosomalabnormalities following ultrasound detection of fetal abnormalities suggestive of a skeletal dysplasia in UK Fetal Medicine units were identi ï¬ed prospectively. After multidisciplinary review by local Fetal Medicine teams and Clinical Geneticists with expertise in fetal dysmorphology, parents were consented for targeted exome trio sequencing. Variant interpretation focused on a virtual panel of 240 genes known to cause skeletal dysplasias. Results: Deï¬nitive molecular diagnosis was made in 15/ 18 (83%) cases. In some cases fetal ultrasound ï¬ndings alone were of suf ï¬cient severity for parents to opt for termination. In others, molecular diagnosis informedaccurate prediction of outcome, improved parental counsel ling and informed parental decisions and perinatal management. Conclusions: Trio sequencing with expert multidisciplin ary review for case selection and data interpretation yields timely, high diagnostic rates in fetuses presenting withunexpected skeletal abnormalities.

29060,"Estonia Introduction: Placenta has a principal role in affecting fetal and maternal physiology. Since pregnancy complications824 J. del Picchiacoincide with changes in placental transcriptome, knowl edge of normal placental gene expression dynamics across gestation is crucial to understand alterations in the placental transcriptome that may lead to pregnancy complications. The aim of the study is to describe a pro ï¬le of placental temporal gene expression dynamics over the course ofhuman pregnancy. Materials and Methods: Analyzed placental samples covered the entire human gestational period: 1 sttrimester (7 10 gestational weeks; n ,8), 2ndtrimester (17 21 g.w.; n,8) and term (37 41 g.w.; n ,8). RNA Seq protocol and basic bioinformatics have been reported by Reiman et al.(2017). The current study focused on grouping placental genes based on their highly correlated expression dynamics across pregnancy trimesters. Enrichment analysis forfunctional pathways was conducted for each gene group using g:Pro ï¬ler (https://biit.cs.ut.ee/gpro ï¬ler/). Results: Among 14,920 genes expressed in the placenta, roughly a quarter exhibited a clear temporal expression pattern over the course of pregnancy. Enrichment analysis showed that genes overexpressed in the ï¬rst trimester are involved in cell cycle and transcription regulation; whereas mid gestation speci ï¬c genes are associated with fetal development, cell communication and differentiation oftissues. Conclusions: We show that a large proportion of genes expressed in the human placenta follow a tightly correlatedtemporal expression pro ï¬le. We hypothesize that distur bances of this âgestational clock âmay lead to placental and fetal developmental abnormalities and pregnancycomplications. Reiman et al. FASEB J.

Goriely1 1University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom,2University College London, London, United Kingdom Low level mosaicism, attributed to clonal expansion of spontaneous mutations, is prevalent in somatic tissues such as skin and blood. We have previously shown that speci ï¬c âselï¬shâmutations spontaneously arising in male germline stem cells (spermatogonia) lead to clonal expansion result ing in elevated mutation levels in sperm over time. Thisprocess, termed sel ï¬sh spermatogonial selection, explains the high spontaneous birth rate and strong paternal age effect of disorders such as achondroplasia, Apert, Noonan and Costello syndromes, with direct evidence for this pro cess occurring at speci ï¬c positions in six genes ( FGFR2 , FGFR3 ,RET,PTPN11 ,HRAS and KRAS ). Here we per form a discovery screen to identify novel mutations and genes under selection in the male germline by performing massively parallel simplex PCR targeting using RainDancetechnology to interrogate mutational hotspots in 71 genes (66.5kb in total) in 276 biopsies of testes from 5 men (mean age: 73 years).

The apparent pau city of X linked NOA is likely to be the consequence ofthe lack of comprehensive, whole X chromosome target ing studies. Abstracts from the 51stEuropean Society of Human Genetics Conference: Oral. . . 825Material and Methods: X chromosome exome sequen cing in 50 idiopathic NOA patients with known testis histology. Variants were ï¬ltered and prioritized according to their minor allele frequency (MAF â¤0.01) and their predicted pathogenicity. RNA interference was used to determine the role of Caf1 55 (the human RBBP7 ortholog) in Drosophila spermatogenesis. Results: We identi ï¬ed 77 rare and predicted as pathogenic variants in 42/50 NOA patients. 76 variantswere private mutations whereas one was found in two unrelated patients. Nine genes (six of them with testis speciï¬c expression or overexpression in the testis) were recurrently mutated in 16 different patients. Two patients affected by spermatogonial arrest presented pathogenic mutations in the RBBP7 gene. Conditional Caf1 55 KO showed that male mutants had tiny testis, no spermatozoa and were sterile. Conclusions : This is the ï¬rst X chromosome exome analysis in highly selected NOA patients. Our approach was relatively successful in identifying candidate genes for the NOA phenotype. Up to now, we performed functionalanalysis only for the RBBP7 gene demonstrating that the protein is essential for Drosophila spermatogenesis hence we propose it as a novel genetic factor for earlyspermatogenic failure.

29063,"Milan, Italy,2University College of London, London, United Kingdom,3Sidra Medicine, Doha, Qatar Hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (HH) is a rare genetic disorder that impairs sexual reproduction. It can be causedby a defective development or function of Gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) neurons. Most HH cases is still idiopathic, despite recent advances in sequencing technol ogies. Here we have combined in silico with in vitro and in vivo mouse models to identify and functionally char acterise the role of a novel gene in the etiopathogenesis ofHH. Speci ï¬cally, we have applied homozygosity mapping together with exome sequencing and computationalmodelling to identify a shared point mutation of the Semaphorin 3G ( SEMA3G ) gene in two brothers with HH, born from consanguineous parents. Further, we have shown that the mutation impairs GnRH neuron migration and Akt activation in vitro, and that mice lacking Sema3g show a reduced number of hypothalamic GnRH neurons andreduced fertility. Together, these results indicate that SEMA3G signalling is required for GnRH neuron migration and its insuf ï¬ciency contributes to the pathogenesis of HH. Grants; telethon GP13142 for AC, A.

Ten Eleven Transloca tion (TET) dioxygenases and DNA repair enzyme Thymine DNA Glycosylase (TDG) are involved in active DNA demethylation by generating and removing, respectively,novel oxidized cytosine species. Mutations of TET1 and TDG , and alterations of the levels of oxidized cytosine species have been identi ï¬ed in human CRC cases, but the biological signi ï¬cance of the TET TDG demethylation axis in intestinal tumorigenesis is unclear.826 J. del PicchiaMaterials and Methods: We generated ApcMinmice with additional inactivation of Tet1 and/or Tdg, and character ized the methylome and transcriptome of intestinal adenomas by DREAM and RNA sequencing, respectively. Results: Tet1 and/or Tdg deï¬cient ApcMinmice show enhanced intestinal tumorigenesis in comparison to wildtype Tet1 and Tdg Apc Minmice. Speci ï¬cally, Tet1 and/or Tdg deï¬cient ApcMinadenomas manifested increased size or features of erosion and stroma activation. Methylomeanalysis revealed progressive loss of global DNA hypo methylation in colonic adenomas from Tet1 and Tdg deï¬cient Apc Minmice, and hypermethylation of CpG islands inTet1 deï¬cient ApcMinmice. In addition, RNA sequencing showed upregulation of genes in in ï¬ammatory and immune response pathways in Tet1 and Tdg mutant colonic adenomas compared to control ApcMinadenomas. Conclusions: Taken together, these ï¬ndings demonstrate the important role of active DNA demethylation mediatedby TET TDG in reducing intestinal tumor formation, by modulating the epigenome and in ï¬ammatory/immune responses. This study highlights a novel mechanism ofepigenetic deregulation during intestinal tumorigenesis with diagnostic, therapeutic and prognostic implications. R. Tricarico: None. J. Madzo: None. G.

These epimutations can be primary, de ï¬ned as purely epi genetic events labile in the germline. They can also besecondary, caused by a cis acting genetic defect transmitted following a Mendelian inheritance pattern, with re establishment of the epigenetic change in the offspring. InLynch syndrome, a few families with a heritable MLH1 epimutation have been reported so far, with various genetic bases including single nucleotide variations and copynumber variations. Materials and Methods: We designed a long range PCR next generation sequencing strategy to screen MLH1 entire gene and applied it to 4 French families with heritable epimutations and 10 additional patients with no proven transmission of their epimutations. Results: This strategy successfully detected the insertion of an Aluelement in MLH1 coding sequence in one family. Two previously unreported MLH1 variants were identi ï¬ed in other epimutation carriers: a nucleotide substitution within intron 1 and a single nucleotide deletion in the 5 â UTR. A partial duplication of MLH1 gene was detected in another family. We demonstrated the segregation of these variants with MLH1 methylation and studied the functional consequences of these defects on transcription. Conclusions: This study represents the largest cohort of patients with MLH1 secondary epimutations associated with a broad spectrum of genetic defects. It provides further insightinto the complexity of molecular mechanisms leading to heritable epimutations.

Pirogov Russian National Research Medical University, Moscow, Russian Federation Introduction: In pathologies such as cancer and under damaging conditions (e.x. radiation) fraction of cells undergoes cell death and releases DNA that becomes part ofthe circulating cell free DNA (cfDNA) pool. CfDNA can be oxidized under oxidative stress. We have shown that in case of cancer the level of oxidation in cfDNA increases. Materials and Methods: Model genetic construction was obtained by insertion of poly G DNA fragments in a vector with GFP gene and subsequent oxidation with UV radiationor H 2O2. Penetration was con ï¬rmed with ï¬uorescent microscopy (comparison with penetration using TurboFect (Thermo, Germany)). mRNA was isolated from MSCs and MCF 7 using RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen, Germany). Gene expression level was assessed using RT PCR (TBP as internal standard). Protein levels were measured withï¬uorescent antibodies using ï¬ow cytometry. Statistics was performed using Statgraphics software. Results: Oxidation of cfDNA transforms cfDNA frag ments into biologically active molecules that regulate level of expression of number of genes. This was shown on a model genetic construction containing poly G insertion thatis prone to oxidation. Plasmids with oxidized poly G insertions penetrate MCF 7 and MSCs and cause rapidly repaired DNA breaks. In concentration 10 200 ng/mloxidized plasmids activate DNA reparation processes and induce antioxidant signaling pathways regulated by NRF2, thus, inhibiting apoptosis and causing adaptive response. Inconcentrations >350 ng/ml oxidized plasmids cause apoptosis. Conclusions: Oxidation of cfDNA plays an important role in its penetration into cancer and stem cells and in adaptive response development.

The challenge ofVUS is epitomized by BRCA1 , a tumor suppressor gene integral to DNA repair and genomic stability. Germline BRCA1 loss of function variants predispose women to early onset breast and ovarian cancers. Although BRCA1 has been sequenced in millions of people, the risk asso ciated with most newly observed variants cannot be de ï¬ nitively assigned. To date, functional studies of BRCA1 VUS have been limited in scope and performed outside of the gene's endogenous context. Methods: We employ saturation genome editing to assay 96.5% of all possible single nucleotide variants (SNVs) in 13 exons that encode critical domains of BRCA1. Ourmultiplex, CRISPR/Cas9 based assay leverages targeted deep sequencing to measure variants' effects on cellular ï¬tness and mRNA expression in human cells dependent on BRCA1 function. Results: We obtain function scores for 3,893 SNVs. Scores are bimodally distributed and nearly perfectlyconcordant with established assessments of pathogenicity (sensitivity ,97%; speci ï¬city,98%). Of 256 VUS, 25.0% score as non functional, as do 15.9% of 3,140 SNVscurrently unobserved clinically. RNA measurements deline ate mechanisms by which SNVs result in loss of BRCA1 function. Hundreds of missense SNVs detrimental toprotein function are identi ï¬ed, as well as dozens of exonic and intronic SNVs that compromise BRCA1 function by disrupting splicing. Conclusions: We predict this data will be directly useful for the clinical interpretation of cancer risk based on BRCA1 sequencing. Furthermore, we propose that this paradigmcan be extended to many additional clinically actionable genes. G. M. Findlay: None. R. Daza: None. B. K. Martin: None. M. D. Zhang: None. A. P. Leith: None.

Huff2 1Public Health College, Harbin Medical University, Harbin, China,2The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, United States To evaluate the contribution of rare genetic variation to the development of soft tissue sarcoma, we conducted a whole exome case control study in 219 cases and 3,507 controls ofEuropean ancestry. We controlled for technological strati ï¬cation biases using XPAT and conducted gene based association tests using VAAST 2.1. Our cases consisted ofsamples from TCGA with one of six soft tissue sarcoma subtypes: leiomyosarcoma (LMS), dedifferentiated lipo sarcoma (DLPS), myxo ï¬brosarcoma (MFS), undiffer entiated pleiomorphic sarcoma (UPS), malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNST), and synovial sarcoma (SS). We observed nominally signi ï¬cant association signals for three well established sarcoma susceptibility genes, NF1 (p,1x1 0 5),TP53 (p,0.0025), and RB1 (p,0.028). MSH2 , an HNPCC gene, was also nominally signi ï¬cant (p,0.0085); previous studies have suggested that sarcomas may be within the spectrum of HNPCC tumors. In general, the effect size estimates for variants in these genes werelarge relative to other cancer types. For likely gene dis rupting variants, the ORs were 39.4 (95% CI: 7.1 â219.3) and 33.0 (95% CI: 2.4 â462.5) for NF1 and MSH2 , respectively. For predicted damaging missense variants, the ORs were 12.0 (95% CI: 2.4 â59.1) and â(95% CI: 6.7 â â) for RB1 and TP53 , respectively. In subtype speci ï¬c analyses, all four genes were signi ï¬cantly associated with LMS, the subtype with the largest sample size. Three of the four genes were signi ï¬cantly associated with at least one additional subtype. Our results indicate that rare coding variants can confer substantial increases in risk for multiple soft tissue sarcoma subtypes. F. Hu: None. Y. Yu: None. J. Chen: None. P. Scheet: None. C. D.

In this family, whole exome sequencing yielded rare, simultaneously het erozygous variants in the Aicardi GoutiÃ¨res syndrome (AGS)genes ADAR andRNASEH2B co segregating with the tumor phenotype. AGS is a genetically induced in ï¬ammatory dis ease particularly of the brain, which has not been associatedwith a consistently increased cancer risk to date. By targeted sequencing, we identi ï¬ed novel ADAR andRNASEH2B var iants, and a 3 to 17 fold frequency increase of the AGSmutations ADAR ,c.577C>G;p.(P193A) and RNASEH2B , c.529G>A;p.(A177T) in the germline of familial glioma patients as well as in test and validation cohorts of glio blastomas and prostate carcinomas versus ethnicity matched controls, whereby rare RNASEH2B variants were signi ï¬cantly more frequent in familial glioma patients. Tumors with ADAR orRNASEH2B variants recapitulated features of AGS, such as calciï¬cation and increased type I interferon expression. Abstracts from the 51stEuropean Society of Human Genetics Conference: Oral. . . 829Patients carrying ADAR orRNASEH2B variants showed upregulation of interferon stimulated gene (ISG) transcripts in peripheral blood as seen in AGS. An increased ISG expression was also induced by ADAR andRNASEH2B variants in tumor cells and was blocked by the JAK inhibitor Ruxolitinib. Our data implicate rare variants in the AGS genes ADAR and RNASEH2B and a type I interferon signature in glioma and prostate carcinoma risk and tumo rigenesis, consistent with a genetic basis underlying in ï¬ammation driven malignant transformation in glioma and pro state carcinoma development.

29068,"2Manchester Centre For Genomic Medicine, Manchester, United Kingdom ARID1B mutations are one of the most frequent causes of ID as determined by large scale whole exome sequencing stu dies. Most published clinical data however is obtained from clinically diagnosed Cof ï¬n Siris patients (ARID1B CSS) and it is unclear whether this data is representative for patients identi ï¬ed through unbiased sequencing techniques (ARID1B ID). Therefore we sought to determine genotypic and phe notypic differences between ARID1B ID and ARID1B CSS. We asked clinicians to add their patient âs information to a web based survey based on previously reported ARID1Bfeatures ( www.arid1bgene.com ). In total, 144 patients (80 ARID1B CSS and 64 ARID1B ID patients) weresubmitted. All patients had truncating mutations which were distributed throughout the gene. Remarkably, no pathogenic mutations were identi ï¬ed in the small in frame exon 3 and the ï¬rst 850 bases of exon 1. All but one patient were reported to have intellectual disability (ID). ARID1B CSS patients displayed more CSS associated dysmorphicfeatures ( p< 0.001) than ARID1B ID patients. ARID1B ID patients were more inclined to have myopia (39.5% vs 18.3%, p,0.024) and cryptorchidism (67.6% vs 41.4%, p,0.005). Prevalences of motor (100%) and speech (93.8%) delay, feeding dif ï¬culties (69.2%), seizures (29.7%) and agenesis of corpus callosum (41.2%) werecomparable in both groups. Based on our data of 144 patients we conclude that except for dysmorphic features there do not seem to be majordifferences between ARID1B ID and ARID1B CSS patients. There therefore appears to be an ARID1B spectrum, and patients should be managed similarlyregardless of clinical diagnosis. E. P.J. van der Sluijs: None. J. Clayton Smith: None. G. W.E.

NIPBL variants account for830 J. del Picchia>70% of patients and result in NIPBL haploinsuf ï¬ciency. NIPBL interacts via its N terminus with MAU2, forming the kollerin complex, responsible for cohesin âs loading onto chromatin. By CRISPR/Cas9, we generated cell lines expressing an N terminal truncated form of NIPBL de ï¬cient for complex formation with MAU2. Molecular characteriza tion revealed reduced NIPBL protein levels and loss of MAU2. However, ChIP sequencing analyses show similar chromatin bound cohesin and NIPBL in wild type and mutantcells indicating unaffected cohesin loading mechanisms. Interestingly, by genome sequencing of CdLS patients, we identi ï¬ed the ï¬rstde novo variant in MAU2 . This mutation causes an in frame deletion of seven amino acids affecting an Î± helix important for wrapping the N terminus of NIPBL within MAU2. Accordingly, in vitro analyses revealed adramatic reduction of MAU2 heterodimerization with NIPBL. Notably, MAU2 is required for the correct folding of the N terminus of NIPBL, which becomes unstable in the absenceof MAU2. Therefore, it might be possible that the inability of MAU2 to interact with NIPBL results in decreased NIPBL protein levels, con ï¬rming NIPBL haploinsuf ï¬ciency as the major pathogenic mechanism of CdLS. In summary, we described the ï¬rstMAU2 mutation in a patient with char acteristic CdLS phenotype. Our functional investigationsreveal a new pathogenic mechanism relevant for CdLS resulting in decreased NIPBL levels upon functional alteration of its binding partner MAU2. I. Parenti: None. S.

Following a via bility screen, homozygous viable mice enter the adultpipeline, whereas for homozygous lethal strains, hetero zygous animals are phenotyped. The latest data release inDecember 2017 comprises 4,364 genes, which adds ~1,000 genes to those previously published, and identi ï¬es new models for human diseases. Methods: Relevant disease models were identi ï¬ed by computing the similarity between the phenotypes in the mice and the human phenotypes associated to their orthologousloci in Mendelian disease. We also compared the ability of homozygous and heterozygous knockouts to phenocopy human disease, stratifying by mode of inheritance. Results: 281 new knockouts in rare disease genes have been analysed since August 2016. Approximately 40% of these partially mimic the clinical phenotypes. Homozygousmutants showed higher similarity scores. However, when divided according to mode of inheritance, these differences only remained signi ï¬cant for autosomal recessive genes, which also had better concordance with mouse zygosity. Diseases with no previous mouse models described in the literature by the Mouse Genome Informatics (MGI) group(~10% of new strains) include Spermatogenic Failure 6, an infertility condition caused by mutations in SPATA16 , now observed in homozygous mice, and Dilated Cardiomyo pathy 1BB, associated with DSG2 and mice displaying increased heart weight, left ventricular dilation, and reduced cardiac contractility. Conclusions: Novel mouse models covering diverse biological systems continue to be incorporated to the IMPC catalogue. Analysis of their phenotypes is enhancing therange of available models that are relevant for human diseases. P. Cacheiro: None. T. Konopka: None. D. Smedley: None. A. Mallon: None. T. Meehan: None.

Here, we report six patients with previously undescribed heterozygous variants clustered inthe 3 â coding region of ACTB. These patients present with clinical features different from BWCFF, including throm bocytopenia, microcephaly, and mild developmental dis ability. Patient derived cells are morphologically and functionally distinct from controls. Assessment of cytos keletal constituents identi ï¬ed a discrete ï¬lament population altered in these cells, which comprises force generating and transmitting actin binding proteins (ABP) known to be associated with thrombocytopenia. In silico modelling andmolecular dynamics (MD) simulations support altered interactions between these ABP and mutant Î² CYA. Our results describe a new clinical syndrome associated withACTB mutations with a distinct genotype phenotype cor relation, identify a cytoskeletal protein interaction network crucial for thrombopoiesis, and provide support for thehypomorphic nature of these actinopathy mutations.

The most common factor contributing to perinatal death is congenital abnormalities. Aim: To use WES and WGS to identify genetic causes of fetal/newborn abnormalities that result in termination of pregnancy, death in utero or in the newborn period, in viewto providing families with answers regarding cause and likelihood of recurrence. Methods: WES and/or WGS is being performed using Illumina sequencing systems, if microarray has not identi ï¬ed a cause. Prospective cases are families referred to the Genetics unit (parent fetus trios) and retrospectivecases are from stored autopsy samples (singletons). High priority cases are consanguineous families, fetuses with multiple malformations, and unexplained fetal/newborndeath. Statistical, bioinformatic and experimental laboratory techniques are used to con ï¬rm causality of variants. Results: 43 prospective trios and 60 retrospective singletons have been recruited and sequenced. Of the prospective cohort, 23% of cases have been solved and an additional 26% have a single promising candidate beinginvestigated. In the retrospective cohort, 18% of cases have strong candidates identi ï¬ed. Solved cases include new832 J. del Picchia disease gene discoveries, new syndrome identi ï¬cation and novel severe fetal presentations of existing rare pediatric disease. The study has contributed directly to the birth of 3 healthy newborns. Discussion: Our results provide insights into molecular mechanisms of early development and indicate that a genomicautopsy using WES/WGS should be a routine component of the investigation of pregnancy loss and perinatal death.

This has led to the recognition that phenotypic heterogeneity resulting from allelic mutations occurs more commonly than previously appreciated. Here, we report thatmissense variants in CDC42, a gene encoding a small GTPase functioning as an intracellular signaling node, underlie a clinically heterogeneous group of phenotypescharacterized by variable growth dysregulation, facial dys morphism, and neurodevelopmental, immunological, and hematological anomalies, including a phenotype resemblingNoonan syndrome, a developmental disorder caused by dysregulated RAS signaling. In silico, in vitro, and in vivo analyses demonstrate that mutations variably perturbCDC42 function by altering the switch between the active and inactive states of the GTPase and/or affecting CDC42 interaction with effectors, and differentially disturb cellularand developmental processes. These ï¬ndings reveal the remarkably variable impact that dominantly acting CDC42 mutations have on cell function and development, creatingchallenges in syndrome de ï¬nition, and exemplify the importance of functional pro ï¬ling for syndrome recognition and delineation.

29074,"University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT, United States Introduction: Mobile elements compose at least half of the human genome, and some mobile element families are still actively inserting in the genome. However, the rate ofmobile element retrotransposition has been inferred only indirectly from phylogenetic comparisons. We report the ï¬rst direct estimate of the retrotransposition rate in a large series of 3 generation human pedigrees. Materials and Methods: We performed whole genome sequencing at 30x average coverage on blood derived DNAfrom 603 CEPH individuals, comprising 34 multi generation pedigrees. The families were joint called using Mobile Element Locator Tool (MELT) and RUFUS toidentify de novo Alu, LINE1, and SVA elements. All candidate de novo mobile element insertions (MEI) were validated using PCR and Sanger sequencing, and ï¬anking SNPs were typed to determine parent of origin. Results: The false negative and false positive rates of MEI detection were 5% and 15%, respectively. Theretrotransposition rate estimates for Alu elements, one in 50, is roughly half the rate estimated using phylogenetic analyses, a difference similar to that observed for singlenucleotide variants. The SVA and LINE1 retrotransposition rates are both approximately one in 100 150 births, which is higher than phylogenetic estimates. De novo MEIs weretransmitted at a 3 fold higher rate among fathers than mothers, with no apparent age bias. Conclusions: The directly estimated Alu retrotransposi tion rate is roughly half of previous phylogenetically based estimates, whereas LINE1 and SVA rates are higher than previously estimated. Future studies will investigatewhether a paternal bias is a consistent hallmark of de novo retrotransposition. Support: NIH GM 59290J. E. Feusier: None. W. Watkins: None. J. Thomas: None. L.

Previous studies have identi ï¬ed that genetic and non genetic host factors play an important role in this variation of the immune response. However, alarge portion of the variation remains unexplained due to limited power of these studies and to the fact that interac tions between genetics and environment are largely ignored. We aim to identify both the genetic and the environment dependent genetic effects that are shared by multiple immune functions in a large population cohort. After the measurement of cytokines (protein level) in response to pathogen stimulations in 500 healthy individuals, weï¬rstly grouped cytokines based on biological relevance in monocytes (IL Î², IL 6 and TNF Î±)o rTc e l l s( I F N Î³,I L 1 7 and IL22) and the pathogen used in stimulation, respectively. Subsequently, we applied a multi trait modeling strategy,where the biological relevant groups were evaluated at genome wide level. A total of 12 genome wide signi ï¬cant loci were detected, of which 6 replicate the previous single trait mapping and 6 are novel. The 12 loci are enriched for genes implicated in immune response pathways and are co localized with genetic risk factors associated to immune mediated diseases like in ï¬ammatory bowel disease and rheumatoid arthritis. In addition, several loci were identi ï¬ed to regulate cytokine production differentially between genderand smoking status. Our results show that integration of multiple immune phenotypes can reveal novel genomic associations andcontext speci ï¬c cytokine QTLs, highlighting the shared genetic basis of cytokine produc tion upon stimulation that contribute to inter individual d iversity of the immune function.

29076,"Shefï¬eld, Shef ï¬eld, United KingdomDuring the last years, we have witnessed a conspicuous upraise in the sequencing of ancient DNA data, with the proliferation of studies attempting to shed light on human origins and migration routes. Dating the ancient DNA is, therefore, of key importance. However, although radio carbon dating is a well established practice, its outcome canbe altered by numerous factors, leading to inaccuracies with carbon dates older than 25,000 BP considered highly unreliable. Here, we introduce a DNA admixture baseddating method, which utilizes allele frequencies that vary over time to create dating components. We developed synthetic DNA typical to speci ï¬c time periods (e.g., 10,500 9,000 BP) and then calculated for each ancient genome the time pro ï¬le, which consisted of the frequencies of those DNA molecules. Using a dataset of ~300 ancient Eurasianswith reliable radiocarbon date ranging from 15,000 BP to 1,500 BP, we demonstrated that our predicted dates are perfectly correlated with radiocarbon dates (r 2,0.9). The average difference between our predictions and the average radiocarbon dates was 800 years. Our results con ï¬rm the usefulness of using time dependent allelic frequency forbiodating and contribute to the understanding of the com plexity of migration and admixture events.

Materials and Methods: We have whole genome sequenced 37K Icelanders and genotyped 155K, a largefraction of the Icelandic population (11% and 46% of 338K, respectively). As part of this effort, we are performing genetic analysis of rare diseases in the clinicalsetting. We sequenced the genomes of two Icelandic brothers diagnosed with CGD in an attempt at ï¬nding the causal mutation. Results: We identi ï¬ed a homozygous loss of function mutation, p. Tyr2Ter, in C17orf62 in both brothers, and found six additional homozygous individuals throughimputation of the mutation into 155K chip genotyped Icelanders. Genotype based recall, and review of hospital based information, revealed that all eight homozygotes havesigns of CGD, manifesting as colitis, severe and recurrent infections, or an impaired neutrophil oxidative burst. Mice deï¬cient in the homolog of C17orf62 are highly susceptible to infections. Homozygosity for p. Tyr2Ter associates with inï¬ammatory bowel disease ( P,8.3 Ã 10 â8; OR (95% CI) ,67.6 (14.5, 315.5)), and growth retardation ( P,3.3 Ã 10 â4; Effect (95% CI) , 1.24 SD ( 1.92, 0.56) / 8.5 cm). We show that homozygosity for p. Tyr2Ter causes complete loss of the C17orf62 protein and a drastic reduction in oneof NADPH âs subunits, indicating a chaperone role for C17orf62. Conclusions: By leveraging a large population speci ï¬c dataset we have elucidated the role of a previously uncharacterized gene in humans, C17orf62 , and identi ï¬ed a novel cause of CGD. G. A.

Compared to controls AAM was decreased in dele tion ( Î, 1.5 years, p ,0.01) and increased in duplication carriers ( Î,+1.5; p,7.8 x 10 5; corrected for BMI and birthyear). We replicated these associations in 129,991 UKBB women, 22,212 EGCUT females and 67 16p11.2 clinicalpatients. A directionally consistent trend was observed in 16p11.2 UKBB and patient males. These features were accompanied by reproductive tract/fertility disorders, e.g.miscarriages (OR ,2.65; p ,0.019), oligo /amenorrhea (OR ,10.2; p ,0.01), cryptorchidism/hypospadias. We validated these results in 16p11.2 mice models by detecting signi ï¬cant changes in timing of ï¬rst ovulation (p < 0.01), estrous cycli city (p,0.03) and uterine size (p ,8.1 x 10 3). Corrobora tively, genes differentially expressed in 16p11.2 patients andmodels were enriched for urogenital disease genes. We found a signi ï¬cant link between the human 16p11.2 dosage, AAM and volume of hypothalamus (p FWE<0 . 0 5 ) , a structure associated with sexual development, suggesting that perturbation of the GnRH axis could be responsible for the observed phenotypes. Usin g Mendelian Randomization we prioritized three potentia l causal genes for AAM. We challenged them by modulating dosage of all 16p11.2 genes ingnrh3:egfp transgenic zebra ï¬sh larvae and quanti ï¬ed GnRH neuronal patterning.

Although CAMK2 was one of the ï¬rst proteins shown to be essential for normal learning and synaptic plasticity in mice, its requirement forhuman brain development has not yet been established. Through a multi center collaborative study based on aAbstracts from the 51stEuropean Society of Human Genetics Conference: Oral. . . 837whole exome sequencing approach, we identi ï¬ed 20 exceedingly rare de novo CAMK2A or CAMK2B variants in 27 unrelated individuals with neurodevelopmental impair ment. The individuals all present with intellectual disability, language and speech delay, and virtually all of them show behavioral anomalies. The variants are either in the kinasedomain or in the autoregulatory domain, suggesting they may change the kinetic function of the enzyme. Variants were assessed for their effect on CAMK2 function onneuronal migration in the developing nervous of mouse embryos transfected with cDNA constructs by in utero electroporation. For both CAMK2A and CAMK2B ,w e identi ï¬ed pathogenic variants that decreased or increased CAMK2 auto phosphorylation at Thr286/Thr287. We fur ther found that all variants affecting auto phosphorylationalso affected neuronal migration, highlighting the impor tance of tightly regulated CAMK2 auto phosphorylation in neuronal function and neurodevelopment.

Mul tiple malformations of cortical development are associatedwith abnormal centrosomal protein function. Rotatin (RTTN), localized at centrosome and basal body, is a pro tein previously linked to a wide variety of brain mal formations, affecting neuronal proliferation, migration and organization. The molecular disease mechanism(s) have not yet been elucidated. We have gathered patient material froma cohort of 8 patients with homozygous or compound het erozygous RTTN mutations. Quanti ï¬cation of RTTN mRNA shows residual transcript in all patients, supporting thehypothesis that complete lack of RTTN is embryonically lethal in human, as seen in RTTN / knockout mice. Immunocytochemistry of RTTN in control ï¬broblasts and derived neurons shows localization at the centrosome. Furthermore, in the cohort of RTTN patients and siRTTN ï¬broblasts, we show that RTTN de ï¬ciency leads to abnor mal centrosome ampli ï¬cation during cell division, leading to multipolar mitotic spindles and mitotic failure. This cellular phenotype has also been reported in Drosophila melanogaster homologue Ana3 knockout neuroblasts. FACS cell cycle analysis showed a highly signi ï¬cant increase of G1 phase cells and decrease in G2/M phase cellsin RTTN de ï¬cient ï¬broblasts. Proteomics analysis shows that RTTN interacts with the non muscle cellular myosin complex (MYH9 MYH10 MYH14).

Introduction: Through a multi center international col laboration, we identi ï¬ed 16 individuals with de novo or dominant variants in RORA , encoding the retinoic acid receptor (RAR) related orphan nuclear receptor alpha, bywhole exome sequencing or chromosomal microarray. The mutational spectrum included four copy number variations (two de novo deletions, one dominant deletion and one de novo duplication) and nine de novo single nucleotide var iants. Intellectual disability (ID) was the predominant clinical feature (15/16), accompanied by seizures (11/16), autisticfeatures (5/16) and cerebellar hypoplasia or atrophy (3/16). Materials and methods: To investigate the relevance of RORA disruption to neurodevelopmental phenotypes in humans, we abrogated the D. rerio ortholog, roraa , through either transient suppression or CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing. Results: Disruption of roraa causes a signi ï¬cant reduction of cerebellar size in developing larvae. Moreover, wild type human RORA mRNA could rescue cerebellar defects caused by roraa morpholino knockdown. Through in vivo complementation and titration of variant mRNA, we observed that missense variants had two distinct pathogenicmechanisms of either haploinsuf ï¬ciency or dominant toxic effects, according to their localization in the ligand or DNA binding domains. Notably, ID and autism were hall mark features in individuals with loss of function variants, whereas ID and cerebellar features were the main pheno types in individuals with variants harboring a dominanttoxic effect. Conclusions: Our combined genetic and functional data point to dual mutational effects that likely determine phe notypic outcome. In sum, our results show that RORA variants lead to a neurodevelopmental disorderAbstracts from the 51stEuropean Society of Human Genetics Conference: Oral. . . 839characterized by intellectual disability, seizures, autistic features and cerebellar defects.

The most frequent cause of mono genic ID the fragile X syndrome is due to the absence of the RNA binding protein (RBP) FMRP. Many other ID genes involved in RNA metabolism have been recentlyidenti ï¬ed. About 5% (40/721) of the ID associated genes play a role in the post transcriptional regulation of gene expression by regulating mRNA splicing, nuclear export,degradation or translation into proteins. We describe here two novel ID genes involved in RNA metabolism. We identi ï¬ed 4 de novo frameshift variants in NOVA2 in patients with Angelman like ID. This gene encodes a RBP implicated in alternative splicing of axon guidance genes. The 4 mutations cluster in a small interval suggesting adominant negative mechanism. This GC and repeat rich interval is poorly covered in most exomes, and the gene may have thus been missed in large scale projects, such asDDD. We show that the mutations lead to dysfunctional truncated proteins not able to regulate speci ï¬c splicing events like the NOVA2 wild type. The inactivation ofNOVA2 by siRNA in differentiated N2A cells causes an increase of neurons with multiple neurites. We identi ï¬ed 4 de novo missense variants in DDX6 , encoding a protein implicated in mRNA degradation and regulation of translation initiation. These variants alter the interaction between DDX6 and its known partners and itsability to form P bodies. These two novel ID genes highlight the important role of RNA metabolism alterations in neurodevelopmental disorders. F. Mattioli: None. B. Isidor: None. C. Balak: None. M. Benard: None. E.

The 15q13.3 microdeletion syndrome region con tains up to 10 genes and is associated with numerous conditions, including autism spectrum disorder (ASD),epilepsy, schizophrenia and intellectual disability; however, the mechanisms underlying their pathogenesis remain unknown. 15q13.3 microdeletion syndrome region impactsten genes and it is very complex to unravel the critical gene or genes that regulates the phenotype. Materials and Methods: We combined whole genome sequencing, human brain gene expression (proteome and transcriptome), and a mouse model with a syntenic heterozygous deletion (Df(h15q13)/ +mice) and determined that the microdeletion results in abnormal development of cortical dendritic spines and dendrite outgrowth. Large scale genetic data was integrated to ï¬nd out the most critical gene (s) within the 15q13.3 microdeletion syndrome region. In addition, we have applied functional analysis in vivo and in vitro to identify phenotypes in mouse and human celllines. Results: Analysis of large scale genomic, transcriptomic and proteomic data identi ï¬edOTUD7A as a critical gene for brain function. OTUD7A expression was found to localize to dendritic and spine compartments in cortical neurons, and its reduced expression in Df(h15q13)/ +cortical neurons contributed to the dendritic spine and dendrite outgrowth deï¬cits. Conclusions: Our results reveal OTUD7A as a major regulatory gene for 15q13.3 microdeletion syndrome phenotypes that contribute to the disease mechanism through abnormal cortical neuron morphologicaldevelopment.

Human accelerated regions (HARs) repre sent conserved genomic loci with elevated divergence in humans compared to other primate and non primate species. At least some HARs are thought to contribute to neurode velopmental functions underlying the unique social and behavioral traits of humans. If some HARs regulate human speciï¬c social and behavioral traits, then mutations would likely impact cognitive and social disorders. Recent studies support the role of HARs in complex neurodevelopmentalfunctions and associated disorders including Autism Spec trum Disorder (ASD) and Schizophrenia. Strikingly, through large scale whole genome and targeted HAR omesequencing we ï¬nd, for the ï¬rst time, that rare noncoding mutations in neurally active HARs contribute to simplex, multiplex, and consanguineous ASD cases. These mutationshighlight more than 20 HARs with putative essential roles in neural development. Functional validation of candidate HARs and underlying mutations using chromatin interac tion sequencing, high throughput reporter assays, and transgenic mice allowed for further functional character ization of inherited HAR mutations in active regulatoryelements for RBFOX1 ,CUX1, PTBP2, GPC4, CDKL5 , and other genes implicated in neural function, autism spectrum disorder, or both.

Clinically, AC manifests with ventricular arrhythmias, syncope, and sudden death. Among the known causative genes, those encoding for the desmosomal proteinsplakophilin 2 (PKP2), desmoplakin (DSP), and desmoglein 2 (DSG2) are most commonly mutated. Little is known about the molecular mechanism(s) behind AC wide phe notypic variability, although it seems that the causative mutations lead to both structural and epigenetic alterations . We aimed at studying the pathogenic effects of a nonsensemutation in desmoglein 2, both at the structural and epigenetic level. Methods and Results: We generated transgenic mice with cardiac speci ï¬c overexpression of the FLAG tagged human desmoglein 2 harboring the Q558* mutation. In Tg hQ mice, desmosome density and length were signi ï¬cantly decreased and Wnt/ Î² catenin signalling suppressed. RNA Seq performed in Tg hQ hearts and non transgenic hearts revealed 24 miRNAs deregulated in transgenic animals. Further bioinformatic analyses for selected miRNAs suggested that miR 217 5p, miR 499 5p, and miR 708 5pmight be involved in AC pathogenesis. Conclusions: Downregulation of the Wnt/ Î² catenin signaling might be considered a common key event in ACpathogenesis. We identi ï¬ed the miRNA signature in AC hearts, with miR 708 5p and miR 217 5p being the most upregulated and miR 499 5p the most downregulatedmiRNAs. All of them were predicted to be involved in the regulation of the Wnt/ Î² catenin pathway and might reveal the potential pathophysiology of AC, as well as beuseful as therapeutic targets for the disease.

We report genetic association analysis of three BP traits in >1 million people. Methods: We undertook a combination of a one and two stage genome wide association study (GWAS) analysis to test ~7M single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) withminor allele frequency â¥1% for systolic and diastolic BP and pulse pressure. We combined the UK Biobank (UKB) cohort (N ,458,577) with the International Consortium for Blood Pressure GWAS (N ,299,024), totalling 757,601 individuals of European descent in the discovery. Data from the Millions Veterans Program and the Estonian Biobankwas used in the two stage design as replication samples (N,249,262). Results: We identi ï¬ed 535 novel loci. We also conï¬rmed all 274 published loci and a further 92 loci that had been previously reported but not replicated. Conditional analysis revealed 163 additional independentsecondary variants, hence to talling over 1,000 indepen dent signals at 901 loci. There is substantial gain in the percentage of BP variance explained by more than 2 fold. We also observed ~10mmHg higher systolic BP in UKB for the comparison between the upper and lower quintiles of the genetic risk score dis tribution. Bi oinformatics analyses identi ï¬ed new potential therapeutic targets for hypertension. Conclusions: This is the largest ever BP GWAS that has tripled the number of BP loci to a total of 901, explaining 27% of the estimated heritability of BP. This study reveals many new insights into BP regulation and drug targetingillustrating the potential for improved cardiovascular disease prevention in the future. E. Evangelou: None. H. Warren: None.

We assessed WGS for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) in which prior cardi omyopathy gene panel sequencing, or exome sequencing,did not establish a molecular diagnosis, i.e. gene elusive HCM, and as a ï¬rst line genetic test. Methods : WGS was performed on 46 gene elusive HCM probands, 16 family members, and 12 HCM probands with no prior genetic testing. We searched for coding region variants and genomic rearrangements in 184 cardiachypertrophy genes, deep intronic variants that alter RNA splicing, and mitochondrial genome variants. All splice altering variants were validated using RNA extracted fromfresh venous blood, or cardiomyocytes derived from induced pluripotent stem cells, of the patients. Results : We found a pathogenic or likely pathogenic variant in 10 out of 46 (22%) gene elusive HCM families. Four families had deep intronic variants in MYBPC3 that activate splicing of pseudo exons; one family had asynonymous MYBPC3 variant shown to disrupt splicing; one family had mitochondrial genome variant; one family had a nonsynonymous MYH7 variant that was not genotyped during exome sequencing; and three families had variants in genes not included in prior cardiomyopathy gene panel testing. As a ï¬rst line genetic test, WGS identi ï¬ed a pathogenic variant in 5 out of 12 (42%) families with no prior genetic testing. Conclusions : WGS identi ï¬ed additional genetic causes of HCM over targeted gene sequencing approaches. Genetic screening of deep intronic regions identi ï¬ed pathogenic variants in 9% of gene elusive HCM. These ï¬ndings translate to more accurate diagnosis and management in HCM families. R. D.

Previously, we identi ï¬ed RASA1 mutations in 50% of patients with CM AVM. Herein we studied non RASA1 patients to further elucidate the pathogenicity of CMs and AVMs. Methods : We conducted a genome wide linkage study on a CM AVM family. Whole exome sequencing was also performed on 9 unrelated CM AVM families. We identi ï¬ed a candidate gene and screened it in a large series of patients. The in ï¬uence of several missense variants on protein function was also studied in vitro. Results : We found evidence for linkage in two loci. Whole exome sequencing data unraveled four distinct damaging variants in EPHB4 inï¬ve families that co segregated with CM AVM. Overall, screening of EPHB4 detected 47 distinct mutations in 54 index patients: 27 lead844 J. del Picchiato a premature stop codon or splice site alteration, suggesting loss of function. The other 20 are non synonymous variants that result in amino acid substitutions. In vitro expression of several mutations con ï¬rmed loss of function of EPHB4. The clinical features included multi focal CMs, telangiectasias, and AVMs. Conclusions : We found EPHB4 mutations in patients with multifocal CMs associated with AVMs. The pheno type, CM AVM2, mimics RASA1 related CM AVM1 and also HHT. RASA1 encoded p120RASGAP is a direct effector of EPHB4. Our data highlights the pathogenetic importance of this interaction and indicts EPHB4 RAS ERK signaling pathway as a major cause for arterio venous malformations. N. Revencu: None. M. Amyere: None.

Prognosis is related to aortic risk of dissection. MFS clinical variability is notable, for ageof onset as well as severity and number of clinical mani festations. To identify genetic modi ï¬ers, we combined genome wide approaches in 1070 clinically well characterized FBN1 disease causing variant carriers: 1) an FBN1 eQTL analysis in 80 ï¬broblasts of FBN1 stop variant carriers, 2) a linkage analysis and 3) a kinship matrix asso ciation study in 14 clinically concordant and discordant sib pairs, 4) a genome wide association study and 5) a whole exome sequencing in 98 extreme phenotype samples. Threegenetic mechanisms of variability were found. A new gen otype/phenotype correlation with an excess of loss of cysteine variants (p ,0.004) in severely affected subjects. A second pathogenic event in another thoracic aortic aneurysm gene or the COL4A1 gene (involved in cerebral aneurysm) was found in 9 individuals. A polygenic modelinvolving at least 9 modi ï¬er loci (named gMod M1 9) was observed through cross mapping of results. Notably, gMod M2 which co localizes with PRKG1 , in which activating variants have already been described in thoracic aortic aneurysm, and gMod M3 which co localized with a metal loprotease (proteins of extra cellular matrix regulation)cluster. Our results represent a major advance in under standing the complex genetic architecture of MFS and pro vide the ï¬rst steps toward prediction of clinical evolution. M. Aubart: A.

AF is a major risk factor for stroke, heart failure and premature death. Materials and Methods: We performed whole exome sequencing on 24 families with at least three family members diagnosed with AF. To investigate the effect ofgenetic variants we investigated CRISPR/Cas9 modi ï¬ed zebra ï¬sh carrying truncating variant of titin ( ttn.2). Results: Four titin truncating variants (TTNtv) were identi ï¬ed. These variants co segregated perfectly with disease and were signi ï¬cantly enriched in patients with familial AF (P,1.76 x 10 6), as compared to the control group (n ,663). This association was replicated in an independent cohort of early onset lone AF patients (n ,399; Odd Ratio ,36.8; P , 4.13 x 10 6). We studied CRISPR/Cas9 modi ï¬ed zebra ï¬sh carrying a titin truncating variant. Using confocal microscopi we observed compromised assembly of the sarcomere in the atria at the early larval stage in homozygous ï¬sh suggesting a predisposition for disease of the atria already in the early development of the heart. We investigated the adult heterozygous mutant hearts using Transmission electronmicroscopy. The heterozygous mutant hearts lacked structu rally intact sarcomeres. The z discs appeared fuzzy and poorly organised, and the M line was missing from all thesarcomeres in both atria and ventricle. Mutant had signi ï¬ cantly shorter sarcomere in atria (p < 0.001). Conclusions: These results indicate that TTNtv are important risk factors for AF that predispose for disease ([OR],36.8). CRISPR/Cas9 modi ï¬ed zebra ï¬shheterozygous lacked intact sarcomeres. These analyses add a new dimension to the understanding of the molecular predisposition for AF. G. Ahlberg: None. L. Refsgaard: None. P. R. Lunde gaard: None. L. S. Andreasen: None. M. F.

Genomic microarrays are currently widely implementedas the ï¬rst tier test for CNV detection. Although it has been proven that microarrays perform well for detecting submicroscopic CNVs, throughput is still rather limited,consumable cost is high, and resolution is ï¬xed depending on the probe density on the microarray. We replaced microarrays by shallow whole genome sequencing(sWGS) for the detection of submicroscopic CNVs in a diagnostic setting. Library pr eparation is largely auto mated on a liquid handling robot and afterwards samplesare sequenced on a HiSeq3000 instrument by means of 50bp single end sequencing. Depending on the indication, resolution can be adjusted by altering the number ofsamples per lane and hence the amount of sequence reads per sample. More sequence reads enable a smaller window size and hence a higher resolution. Since July 2017 morethan 1000 clinical samples w ere processed including postnatal blood specimen, leukemic samples (ALL, CLL), tumors, products of conception (POCs) and prenatalsamples. The plummeting costs of sequencing and the ability to automation resu lts in a more cost effective work ï¬ow and a higher throughput. CNVseq shows a higher ï¬exibility towards resolution and species under investigation. Moreover, we show that both duplications and deletions are more clearly de ï¬ned, enabling a better identi ï¬cation of (low grade) mosaicism. In conclusion, we show that shallow whole genome sequencing is an846 J. del Picchiaappropriate alternative for genomic microarrays for the detection of clinically relevant copy number aberrations. B.

NGS, however, has limitations. In a study pre sented at the 2017 ESHG meeting, we found that variants ofother, technically challenging types comprise between 9 and 19% of the pathogenic variants harbored by patients, depending on clinical indication. These variants includelarge indels, single exon CNVs, variants in repetitive regions, etc. This study has since been expanded to include over 180,000 patients with diverse indications, and leads tosimilar conclusions. Methods: We developed a synthetic specimen containing 22 challenging pathogenic variants of diverse types in 7commonly tested genes. This specimen was sequenced using 10 different NGS work ï¬ows by an international group of collaborating laboratories. These tests employed differentsequencing platforms, library methods, and bioinformatics pipelines. Results: With one exception, all of the relatively ""easy"" SNVs and indels were uniformly detected. However, only 10 of the 22 challenging variants were detected by all tests, and just 3 tests detected all 22. Many, but not all of theselimitations were bioinformatic in nature. Discussion: Evaluating the sensitivity of tests for complex variants can be dif ï¬cult. Recent guidelines [Roy et al. 2017] recommend that at least 59 variants of each type be used in validation, a number that is dif ï¬cult to achieve for complex variants given the scarcity of positive controls. Methods such as ours may help, and this speci ï¬c specimenis available to members of the ESHG community and is being expanded. S. Lincoln: A. Employment (full or part time); Sig niï¬cant; Invitae.

One advantage of WGS is its ability to test for a variety of variant types simultaneously. Germlinerepeat expansions cause over 20 neurological disorders that can be hard to differentiate clinically from each other and from disorders caused by other variant types. We presentdata on the use of pipeline to identify repeat expansionsAbstracts from the 51stEuropean Society of Human Genetics Conference: Oral. . . 847from WGS that uses the ExpansionHunter bioinformatics tool. Materials and Methods: A pilot dataset comprising 4,833 genomes from rare disease patients was used to genotype repeats in 20 loci. Within this cohort, 414 experimental validation results (normal alleles) across 13loci were available to assess the STR size estimates. An additional cohort of 5,529 patient genomes was then analysed to identify pathogenic expansions. Results: ExpansionHunter computed precise and accurate estimates of 99.8% normal alleles tested across all the loci analysed. Further, we identi ï¬ed 10 pathogenic expansions including FXS, ALS, HTT, SCA6 and SCA12 that were consistent with the patient phenotype.

However, most target enrichment methods are reliant upon some form of ampli ï¬cation which can nega tively impact downstream analysis. For example, ampli ï¬ cation removes epigenetic marks present in native DNA, including nucleotide methylation, which are hypothesizedto contribute to disease mechanisms in some disorders. In addition, some genomic regions known to be causative ofmany genetic disorders have extreme GC content and/or repetitive sequences that tend to be recalcitrant to faithful ampli ï¬cation. We have developed a novel, ampli ï¬cation free enrich ment technique that employs the CRISPR/Cas9 system to target individual genes. This method, in conjunction withthe long reads, high consensus accuracy, and uniform coverage of SMRT Sequencing, allows accurate sequence analysis of complex genomic regions that cannot beinvestigated with other technologies. Using this strategy, we have successfully targeted a number of repeat expansion disorder loci ( HTT,FMR1 ,ATXN10 , C9orf72 ). With this data, we demonstrate the ability to isolate thousands of individual on target molecules and, using theSequel System, accurately sequence through long repeats regardless of the extreme GC content. The method is compatible with multiplexing of multiple target loci andmultiple samples in a single reaction. Furthermore, because there is no ampli ï¬cation step, this technique also preserves native DNA molecules for sequencing, allowing for thedirect detection and characterization of epigenetic signa tures. To this end, we demonstrate the detection of 5 mC in the CGG repeat of the FMR1 gene that is responsible for Fragile X syndrome. J. Ekholm: A. Employment (full or part time); Signi ï¬cant; PacBio.

None theless, these methods yield data that is incomplete, and fall short of detecting all clinically relevant genetic variantspresent in individual genomes. We anticipate that long read sequencing techniques may augment genetic diagnosis for a clinically well characterized patient population with intel lectual disability that we have studied over the years. Pre viously analyses with CNV microarrays, WES (de Ligt, NEJM 2012) and by short read WGS (Gilissen, Nature2014) all failed to detect a causal variant. We performed long read SMRT sequencing in ï¬ve such patient parent trios with coverages between 15 45 fold. Per individual genome we identify >22,000 SVs between 50bp 50kb in size. More than 65% of SVs are novel compared to high depth short read sequencing (IlluminaNovaSeq). Using the trio approach we are able to ï¬lter the 500 1,000 rare SVs per patient to ~40 SVs that have no parental read support; validations of the best 5 candidate de novo SVs per case are ongoing. The high coverage genomes even allow detection of SVs/indels in the 20 50bp range; per genome >25,000 of those are called per genome. Next to identifying novel SVs our data also con ï¬rm that long read sequencing data provide coverage in >20Mb previously uncovered genome regions. Additionally long read sequencing data facilitate phasing of de novo SNVs and compound heterozygous variants. In summary, long read sequencing identi ï¬es a signi ï¬cant number of previously hidden SVs. The de novo mutation rates as well as the clinical relevance of these previously hidden genetic variants can now be further explored. A. Hoischen: None. A. M. Wenger: A.

Even if the mutation is apparently de novo , there is a recurrence risk due to parental germ line mosaicism, depending on in which gonadal generation the mutation occurred. Materials and Methods: We demonstrate the power of using SMRT sequencing and ddPCR to determine parental origin and allele frequencies of de novo mutations in germ cells in two families whom had undergone assisted reproduction. Results: In the ï¬rst family, a TCOF1 variant c.3156C>T was identi ï¬ed in the proband with Treacher Collins syndrome. The variant affects splicing and was determinedAbstracts from the 51stEuropean Society of Human Genetics Conference: Oral. . . 849to be of paternal origin. It was present in <1% of the paternal germ cells, suggesting a very low recurrence risk. In the second family, the couple had undergone several unsuccessful pregnancies where a de novo mutation PTPN11 c.923A>C causing Noonan syndrome was identi ï¬ed. The variant was present in 40% of the paternal germ cells suggesting a high recurrence risk. Conclusions: Ourï¬ndings highlight a successful strategy to identify the parental origin of mutations and toinvestigate the recurrence risk in couples that have under gone assisted reproduction with an unknown donor or in couples with gonadal mosaicism that will undergo pre implantation genetic diagnosis.

We now identi ï¬edde novo missense variants clustering in the BTB domain encoding region ofRHOBTB2 in ten individuals with a developmental and epileptic encephalopathy, characterized by early onset epi lepsy, severe intellectual disability, postnatal microcephaly,movement disorders and in several individuals by (post ictal) hemiparesis and secondary MRI anomalies. RHOBTB2 interacts with a cullin dependent ubiquitinligase complex and thus regulates auto ubiquitination and recruits other substrates to the complex. Though direct interaction of mutant RHOBTB2 with CUL3 did not appearto be impaired by co immunoprecipitation, we observed increased levels of mutant RHOBTB2 compared to wild type 24 hours after transfection of HEK293 cells. Abol ishing this effect by adding a proteasome inhibitor indicates decreased degradation of mutant RHOBTB2 in the protea some, probably due to impaired ubiquitination. Similarly,elevated levels of the Drosophila ortholog RhoBTB in vivo were associated with seizure susceptibility and severe locomotor defects, while knockdown of RhoBTB resultedin no or only very mild phenotypes.

Using NGS we were able todescribe a new paediatric neurological disease caused by variants in NFE2L2 . NRF2, encoded by NFE2L2 , is themaster regulator of defense against stress. Somatic muta tions of NFE2L2 leading to NRF2 accumulation promote drug resistance in cancer cells. Materials and Methods: We investigated a 9 year old boy with developmental delay, failure to thrive, immuno deï¬ciency and leukoencephalopathy. We applied Mende liome patient parent sequencing on the Illumina Miseq platform and ï¬ltered for pathogenic variants. GeneMatcher was used to ï¬nd further patients. NFE2L2 variant was characterized using cell biology and biochemical approaches. As a therapy approach the ï¬avone luteolin was tested. Results: We identi ï¬edde novo mutations in NFE2L2 in four children and showed that cancer related mutations as inborn de novo mutations cause an early onset multisystem disorder with failure to thrive, immunode ï¬ciency and neurological symptoms. NRF2 accumulation leads to widespread misregulation of gene expression and animbalance in cytosolic redox balance. Patients âblood show increased activity of the NRF2 regulated enzymes G 6 P dehydrogenase and glutathione reductase as well asdecreased homocysteine level. Treatment with luteolin leads to a reduction of the NRF2 level and decreased expression of NRF2 targets in ï¬broblasts and an improve ment of the course of disease in one patient. Conclusions: The unique combination of white matter lesions, hypohomocysteinaemia and increased G 6 P dehydrogenase activity will facilitate early diagnosis and therapeutic intervention of this novel disorder.

Type 2A Protein Phos phatases (PP2A) are highly expressed in brain, and catalyzedephosphorylation of phospho Ser/Thr residues in diverse substrates. Structurally, PP2A holoenzymes comprise a catalytic C, a scaffolding A, and a regulatory B type sub unit, which determines substrate speci ï¬city and physiolo gical function. Recently, de novo mutations in genes encoding subunits A Î±and B56 Î´, and less frequently, B56 Î² and B56 Î³, have been implicated in intellectual disability/ developmental delay (ID/DD). Now, we describe 12 indi viduals with a de novo mutation in PPP2CA , encoding the catalytic C Î±subunit, phenotypically characterized by mild to severe ID/DD, behavioral problems, variable types of epilepsy, hypotonia and brain abnormalities. PPP2CA mutations consist of a partial deletion, a frame shift, three nonsense (Gln125*, Arg214*, Arg295*), one single amino acid duplication, four non recurrent and one recurrentmissense mutation (His191Arg). Functional studies showed complete null alleles in the former four cases, hinting towards a haploinsuf ï¬ciency mechanism. In the eight other cases, functional characterization of the mutants showed mutation speci ï¬c biochemical distortions, includingdecreased binding to the A subunit and/or speci ï¬c B type subunits, as well as mildly to severely impaired phosphatase activity. Several mutants showed increased binding to the Bââ/STRN subunits, an observation previously also made for ID associated A Î±mutants. Thus, in the latter eight cases, a dominant mechanism could not be excluded. Weconclude that PP2A biogenesis and activity are severely compromised in individuals with ID/DD carrying de novo PPP2CA mutations, further underscoring the importance of PP2A dysfunction in genetic brain disorders.

Public Health and Pediatrics, Torino, Italy Genomic rearrangements and CNVs are structural aberra tions of the human genome which contribute to human disease. It is well established that structural abnormalities spanning coding genes can have pathogenic consequences due to gene dosage effect (coding CNVs). However, theincreasing knowledge about regulatory elements, spatial folding of DNA, and the discovery of Topologically Associated Domains (TADs) allowed the identi ï¬cation of rearrangements that modify the regulatory context of dis ease genes, without affecting their coding region (non 852 J. del Picchiacoding CNVs). Here, we describe an instructive and unique example of a neurodegenerative disorder associated to both coding and noncoding CNVs at the LMNB1 locus. Auto somal Dominant adult onset demyelinating LeukoDystro phy (ADLD) is a fatal disorder affecting myelin in the central nervous system. ADLD is due to LMNB 1 gene duplication, causing its overexpression at mRNA and pro tein levels. We have collected four patients with clinical and MRI ï¬ndings suggestive of ADLD, without LMNB1 duplication. Using array CGH, we have identi ï¬ed four different overlapping deletions located upstream LMNB1 . The minimal deleted region was 167 kb and span thephysiological enhancer of the LMNB1 gene already char acterized by our group. Furthermore, it eliminates a TAD boundary, allowing foreign interactions between theLMNB1 promoter and four brain speci ï¬c enhancers. We demonstrated LMNB1 overexpression in ï¬broblasts, and in a postmortem brain sample. In conclusion, ADLD is causedby LMNB1 overexpression due to the duplication of the gene or to the alteration of the LMNB1 regulatory land scape. This latter represents an emerging pathogenicmechanism that should be taken into account in clinical practice. E. Giorgio: None. M. Spielmann: None. B. C. Nmezi: None. G. Vaula: None. A.

Regenerative gene based medicines aim to cure disease at the molecularlevel using innovative gene editing technologies, such as CRiSPR/Cas9 technology. Recent studies have shown the efï¬cacy of adeno associated virus (AAV) vectors which transport guide RNAs (sgRNA) and Cas9 in restoring the expression of altered proteins. Recent works have shownthat AAV9 serotype is an ef ï¬cient vector to preferentially target neuronal cells in vivo by intravenous injection. We have recently generated iPSC derived neurons from FOXG1 mutated patients, paving the way to testing perso nalized therapeutic approaches in disease relevant cells. We have engineered a two plasmid system to correct speci ï¬c FOXG1 mutations, namely c.460dupG p. Glu154Gly fs*300 and c.688C>T p. Arg230Cys. The ï¬rst construct brings mutation speci ï¬c sgRNA and donor DNA and an mCherry/GFP reporter system. The second construct har bours a self cleaving spCas9 able to inactivate itself after cleavage, avoiding off target cuts. The two plasmids havebeen encapsidated into AAV9. The ef ï¬ciency of the AAV system has been tested in multiple cell types in vitro, indicating that AAV9 has indeed the highest infectionefï¬ciency in neurons and ï¬broblasts while for iPSCs and neuronal precursor cells AAV2 is more ef ï¬cient. The ef ï¬ cacy of sequence correction has been tested by Next Gen eration Sequencing (NGS) analysis.

The identi ï¬cation of pathogenic genetic variants in DEEs remains crucial for deciphering this complex group and for accurately caring affected patients. Using trio whole exome sequencing, we ï¬rst identi ï¬ed a heterozygous missense variant in PACS2 in two unrelated patients with DEE and facial dysmorphism. National and international data sharing allowed us t o identify a recurrent de novo PACS2 heterozygous missense variant (p. Glu209Lys) in 12 other unrelated patients. All patients, aged 16 months to 16 years, presented infanti le epilepsy starting on the ï¬rst days or weeks of life and an overall developmental delay or ID with or without behavioral disorders, common cer ebellar dysgenesis and facial dysmorphism. PACS2 encodes a multifunc tional sorting protein involved in nuclear gene expression and pathway traf ï¬c regulation. PACS2 depletion alters gene expression and causes mito chondria fragmentation, mito chondria uncoupling from the endoplasmic reticulum and disturbs cell metabolism and blocks apoptotic programs. PACS2 is an important paralog ofPACS1 t h a th a sb e e np r e v i o u s l yr e p o r t e di np a t i e n t s with intellectual disability, f acial morphological features and/or epilepsy. Both proteins harbor cargo(furin) bindingregions (FBRs) that bind cargo proteins, sorting adaptors and cellular kinase. Functiona l studies demonstrated thatthePACS2 recurrent variant red uces the ability of the predicted autoregulatory domain to modulate the interac tion between the PACS2 FBR and client proteins, which may disturb cellular function. These ï¬ndings support the causality of this recurrent de novo PACS2 heterozygous missense in DEEs with facial dysmorphim and cerebellardysgenesis. N. Jean MarÃ§ais: None. H. E. Olson: None. E.

29102,"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, United States,2Analytic and Translational Genetics Unit, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA, United States Introduction: Mendelian randomization (MR) is an approach to infer causality of an exposure with an outcome. An assumption in MR is that the variant used as the instrumental variable acts on the outcome exclusivelythrough the exposure. Horizontal pleiotropy occurs when the variant has an effect on the outcome outside of the pathway of the exposure. Horizontal pleiotropy can causebias in the causal estimate in MR. Studies have shown that variants identi ï¬ed from genome wide association studies are associated with multiple traits and that pleiotropy maybe common. However, the extent to which horizontal pleiotropy affects MR is unknown.854 J. del PicchiaMaterials and Methods: We have evaluated the role of horizontal pleiotropy in MR. Speci ï¬cally, we developed a method to detect and correct for horizontal pleiotropic outliers, called the Mendelian Randomization Pleiotropy RESidual Sum and Outlier (MR PRESSO) test. Results: After applying MR PRESSO to pairwise comparisons of 82 complex traits and diseases, we observed signiï¬cant horizontal pleiotropy in 922 (22%) of 4,250 MR tests in total. Amongst causal relationships, we observedthat signi ï¬cant pleiotropic outliers distorted causal estimates in MR between 168% and 189% on average. Finally, we observed that horizontal pleiotropy in MR can be correctedin some but not in all instances. Conclusions: These ï¬ndings suggest that horizontal pleiotropy is pervasive and should be carefully consideredin order to maintain the validity of MR.

To address this challenge, we propose a summary statistics based Mendelian Randomization (MR) approach that uses multiple SNPs jointly as instruments and multiple gene expression traits as simultaneous exposures. Such anapproach should be more robust to violations of MR assumptions than state of the art tools (GSMR, TWAS).When applied to 43 human phenotypes it uncovered 3,233 putative genes causally associated with at least one phe notype resulting in 8,388 gene trait associations; of note 5,982 of these loci were missed by GWAS. For example, expression of CRIPT , previously associated with a Men delian syndrome with short stature (OMIM:615789), iscausally associated with height in the general population. Similarly, expression of the RIDDLE syndrome associated RNF168 (OMIM:611943) correlates with educational attainment. Our analysis found 58% (1,866/3,233) of genes having pleiotropic causal effect, impacting up to 20 traits. Notably, ANKRD55 showed directionally consistent causal effect on rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn âs disease and in ï¬am matory bowel disease. Using eQTLs from multiple tissues (GTEx) revealed numerous tissue speci ï¬c causal effects, often driven by differences in gene expression. In line with previous ï¬ndings, LDL level is driven speci ï¬cally by SORT1 liver expression. Our method identi ï¬es loci missed by conventional GWAS and pinpoints likely functionally relevant disease genes in known regions. Our ï¬ndings unravel tissue speci ï¬c, causal gene expression networks shared among a range of phenotypes.

Whereas LDSC regression uses summary statistics, methods like Haseman Elston (HE)regression and genomic relatedness matrix (GRM) restric ted maximum likelihood infer parameters such as SNP based heritability from individual level data directly. Therefore, these two types of methods are typically con sidered to be profoundly different. Nevertheless, recent work has revealed that LDSC and HE regression yield near identical SNP based heritability estimates when confound ing strati ï¬cation is absent. We now extend the equivalence; Abstracts from the 51stEuropean Society of Human Genetics Conference: Oral. . . 855under the strati ï¬cation assumed by LDSC regression, we show that the intercept can be estimated from individual level data by transforming the coef ï¬cients of a regression of the phenotype on the leading principal components from the GRM. Using simulations, considering various degrees and forms of population strati ï¬cation, we ï¬nd that intercept estimates obtained from individual level data are nearly equivalent to estimates from LDSC regression ( R2> 99%). An empirical application corroborates these ï¬ndings. Hence, LDSC regression is not profoundly different from methods using individual level data; parameters that are identi ï¬ed by LDSC regression are also identi ï¬ed by meth ods using individual level data. In addition, our results indicate that, under strong strati ï¬cation, there is mis attribution of strati ï¬cation to the slope of LDSC regression, inï¬ating estimates of SNP based heritability from LDSC regression ceteris paribus . Hence, the intercept is not a panacea for population strati ï¬cation. Consequently, LDSC regression estimates should be interpreted with caution, especially when the intercept estimate is signi ï¬cantly greater than one. R. de Vlaming: None. M. Johannesson: None. P.

29105,"Kingdom,2MRC IGMM, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, United Kingdom,3The Roslin Institute and Royal (Dick) School of Veterinary Studies, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh,United Kingdom We describe a genome wide analytical approach that draws its theoretical basis from a variant of the GREML approach that uses both local and genome wide relationship matrices to provide regional estimates of the heritability acrosslocally de ï¬ned regions in the genome. The novelty in this approach is that it utilises a relationship matrix that is based on local haplotype blocks de ï¬ned by recombination boundaries in the genome. Compared with single SNPs, use of haplotypes provides a better strategy for capturing the true genomic relationship amongst individuals in the pre sence of rare variants and thus provides real bene ï¬t over single SNPs in recovering much of the hidden heritability and identifying novel gene variants. We hypothesize thatthis approach will complement existing GWAS analytical approaches by capturing regions in the genome contributingto the phenotypic variation that existing GWAS methods fail to capture. We implemented this approach on simulated data and explored it in some detail, with results from the simulation study supporting our hypothesis. We further demonstrate that there are real bene ï¬ts to be gained from this approach by applying it to real data from circa 20,000individuals from the Generation Scotland: Scottish Family Health Study. We analysed height and major depressive disorder (MDD). We identi ï¬ed four novel regions (p value between 3.75E 05 and 3.605E 06) and 32 novel regions (p value between 4.92E 05 and 7.5E 07) harbouring a total of 64 and 1156 SNPs for height and MDD respectively.

There was no evidence of association for the triglyceride score in the Ugandan samples (beta , 0.022, 95%CI: 0.050 0.007, p ,0.14). Triglyceride levels were predicted inversely by the HDLscore in the UK (beta , 0.032, 95%CI: 0.052 0.012, p , 1x1 0 3) and the Ugandan samples (beta , 0.062, 95%CI: 0.090â0.033, p ,5x1 0 4). Ourï¬ndings question the assumption that genetic factors are generally the same across populations for any complex trait.

Previous work has evaluated their impact (in terms of their total length, number of affected genes) on human health. This however fails to account forpotential interactions between deleterious variants. To estimate possible epistatic mechanisms we followed twoapproaches using our annotation of 33,000 heterozygous deletions in a cohort of 350,000 unrelated genetically British individuals from the UK Biobank. First, we analyzed all pairwise combinations of deletions and observed that some deletion pairs were identi ï¬ed in the same genome signi ï¬cantly less than expected by chance. We observed that deletions that often co occur are signiï¬cantly shorter than those who co occur rarely. Our results suggest antagonistic epistasis between long dele tions, with each additional variant decreasing ï¬tness more drastically than the previous one. Second, assuming that decreased expression of a gene is an important consequence of a deletion, we expect to see more Gain of Expression (GOE) single nucleotide regula tory alleles in hemizygous deletion carriers, with potentialcompensatory effect to partially recover the gene expression level. Indeed, we observe a signi ï¬cant increase in frequency of GOE alleles (de ï¬ned as cis eQTLs in GTEx) in deletion carriers versus euploid controls, supporting our hypothesis that cases with non compensated deleterious variants have increased probability to be selected out . Altogether our results revealed abundant epistatic inter actions both between different deletions and between deletions and single nucleotide regulatory variants, thedetermination of which will be important to reliably assess the human mutation load in the personalized health era.

This condition affects ~1:4000individuals worldwide and is highly clinically and geneti cally heterogeneous, presenting with variable symptoms and inheritance patterns. We identi ï¬ed a homozygous missense alteration (c.75C>A, p. D25E) in the CLCC1 gene, which encodes a presumptive intracellular chloride channel highly expressed in the retina, associated with autosomalrecessive RP in eight consanguineous families from Pakis tani and the UK. The p. D25E alteration decreased CLCC1 channel function accompanied by accumulation of mutantprotein in granules within the ER lumen. In keeping with these ï¬ndings, Clcc1 +/ KO mice displayed depressed electroretinogram and photoreceptor number. Togetherthese ï¬ndings de ï¬ne a single founder gene mutation as a cause of RP in families of Pakistani descent, and strongly suggest that CLCC1 function is crucial for maintainingretinal integrity and function.

Families and sporadic cases have been reported predominantly in East andSoutheast Asian ethnicities; however, the genetic cause has not been elucidated. Homozygous premature nonsense mutations leading to loss of function of GPNMB contributeto the iris pigment dispersion phenotype in mouse pig mentary glaucoma. However, no mutations in GPNMB have been identi ï¬ed in human pigmentary glaucoma and pigment dispersion syndrome. We establish that the compound het erozygosity or homozygosity of GPNMB truncating alleles is the cause of autosomal recessive ACD. Six nonsense orframeshift mutations were identi ï¬ed in nine individuals diagnosed with ACD. Immuno ï¬uorescence analysis of skin biopsies showed that GPNMB is expressed in all epidermalcells, with the highest staining observed in melanocytes. GPNMB staining is signi ï¬cantly reduced in the lesional skin of affected individuals. Hyperpigmented lesionsexhibited signi ï¬cantly increased amounts of DNA/keratin positive amyloid deposits in the papillary dermis and in ï¬l trating macrophages compared with hypo /depigementedmacules. Depigmentation of the lesions was attributable to loss of melanocytes. Intracytoplamic ï¬brillary aggregates were observed in keratinocytes scattered in the lesionalepidermis. Thus, our analysis indicates that loss of GPNMB, which has been implicated in melanosome858 J. del Picchiaformation, autophagy, phagocytosis, tissue repair, and negative regulation of in ï¬ammation, underlies autosomal recessive ACD, and provides insights into the etiology of amyloidosis and pigment dyschromia.

It is characterized by a severe and progressive neurode generation for which no effective treatment exists. Previously, we demonstrated the usefulness of siRNAs targeting EXTL2 genes (involved in HS synthesis) as an effective short term substrate reduction therapy (SRT), onSanï¬lippo C patients âï¬broblasts. Now, we use different lentiviral vectors encoding shRNAs targeting EXTL2 to analyse their long term effect. We observe a clear reductioninEXTL2 mRNA levels sixty days after transduction and an evident decrease of the HS amounts. Due to the good results obtained, now we are using neurons derived from patients âinduced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) as a cellular model. We are using an established protocol to differentiate those iPSC into neurons within aweek. Neurons show mature signatures and functional properties after one month. This technique will provide new insights in the usefulness of this treatment in the mainaffected cell type. To evaluate this therapeutic option, we are analysing the neurons, focusing on aspects such as the inhibition of the EXTL2 gene at the mRNA level or the accumulation of HS over time by immunocytochemistry. Our preliminary results in patients âï¬broblasts indicate that shRNAs could be a long term SRT and open a door forthe development of a promising therapeutic approach for Sanï¬lippo C syndrome.

Due to the genotype variability of IMDs and the upcoming of personalized medicine has prompted theemergence of developing new models. The aim of this work was the generation of a hepatic model of methylmalonic aciduria cblB type by hepatocyte differentiation of inducedpluripotent stem cells (IPSCs) generated by reprogramming of patient derived ï¬broblasts. This organic aciduria is caused by the de ï¬ciency of ATP: cob(I)alamin adenosyl transferase (ATR) encoded by the MMAB gene. Fibroblasts from a patient bearing a hypomorphic destabilizing muta tion in this gene (p. Ile96Thr) were reprogrammed using acommercial kit based on Sendai virus vectors. After the molecular and functional characterization of the iPSC line, these cells were differentiated in vitro into de ï¬nitive endoderm and then incubated with speci ï¬c factors, aimed at hepatocyte differentiation. IPSC derived hepatocytes expressed relevant hepatic markers analyzed by immuno ï¬uorescence. Finally, the hepatocytes generated were used for evaluation of potential pharmacological chaperones previously described (N {[(4 chlorophenyl)carbamothioyl]amino] 2 phenylacetamide and 4 (4 (4 ï¬uorophenyl) 5 methyl 1H pyrazol 3 yl)benzene 1,3 diol)) in combination with hydroxocobalamin, providing evidences of its positiveeffect on the activity of the mutant ATR hepatocytes. Hence, our ï¬ndings provide an experimental suitable model for the investigation of the hepatotoxicity of new drugs andthe pathogenesis of this severe disease serving also as ex vivo platform for organoids generation and therapeutic applications.

Defects in thestability of mitoribosomal proteins or mitoribosome assembly impair mitochondrial protein translation, causing combined OXPHOS enzyme de ï¬ciency and clinical dis ease. Here we report four autosomal recessive pathogenic mutations in the gene encoding the small mitoribosomal subunit protein, MRPS34, in six subjects from four unre lated families with Leigh syndrome and combined OXPHOS defects. Whole exome sequencing was used to independently identify all variants. Two splice site muta tions were identi ï¬ed, including homozygous c.321 +1G>T in a subject of Italian ancestry and homozygous c.322 10G>A in affected sibling pairs from two unrelated familiesof Puerto Rican descent. In addition, compound hetero zygous MRPS34 mutations were identi ï¬ed in a proband of French ancestry; a missense (c.37G>A [p. Glu13Lys]) and anonsense (c.94C>T [p. Gln32*]) variant. We demonstrated that these mutations reduce MRPS34 protein levels and the synthesis of OXPHOS subunits encoded by mtDNA. Examination of the mitoribosome pro ï¬le and quantitative proteomics showed that the mitochondrial translation defect was caused by destabilization of the small mitoribosomalsubunit and impaired monosome assembly. Lentiviral mediated expression of wild type MRPS34 rescued the defect in mitochondrial translation observed in skin ï¬bro blasts from affected subjects, con ï¬rming the pathogenicity of MRPS34 mutations. Our data establish that MRPS34 is required for normal function of the mitoribosome in humansand furthermore demonstrate the power of quantitative proteomic analysis to identify signatures of defects in spe ciï¬c cellular pathways in ï¬broblasts from subjects with inherited disease.

Complex I deï¬ciency is the most common biochemical diagnosis, particularly prevalent in paediatric patients. Mitochondrial disease is caused by mutations affecting the mitochon drion âs own genome (mtDNA) or one of the ~1150 nuclear encoded mitoproteome components. The limited genotype: phenotype correlation in mitochondrial disease means next generation sequencing methodologies are critical for therapid genetic diagnosis of patients. Materials and Methods Whole exome and targeted next generation sequencing was performed for three subjects with suspected mitochondrial disease. Functional evaluation of identi ï¬ed variants was undertaken using subject ï¬broblasts and/or muscle biopsy, including cDNA studies, complexome pro ï¬ling, complementation studies and assess ment of steady state levels. Results We describe three unrelated individuals who harbour biallelic variants in NDUFAF8 , a recently identi ï¬ed ancillary factor required for assembly of the complex I holoenzyme. We provide functional evidence to support the pathogenicity of these NDUFAF8 variants and unequivo cally establish this gene as a cause of complex I de ï¬ciency in association with an exclusively Leigh like clinical presentation. Conclusions Functional experimentation including com plementation studies and complexome pro ï¬ling of subject cell lines establishes NDUFAF8 as the twelfth complex I assembly factor associated with human disease and validates the importance of orphan gene characterisation.

Here, we systematically dissected the functional networks associatedwith 16p11.2 RGD from transcriptome analyses of 70 mice with reciprocal CNV of the syntenic 7qF3 region across cortex, striatum, and cerebellum, as well as liver, white andbrown adipose tissues in a subset of 16 mice (n ,250 samples). We integrated these data with brain tissues from a Kctd13 mouse model (a putative driver of 16p11.2 neu roanatomical phenotypes, n ,50), and CRISPR engi neered, isogenic 16p11.2 iPSC derived NSCs (n ,25) and induced neurons (n ,27). The strongest magnitude of effect sizes from 7qF3 were observed across brain regions by comparison to non brain tissues (cortex 7qF3 region aver age p value ,8.80E 35; non brain p ,0.0013), re ï¬ecting the ~3x higher basal expression changes. Coexpression network analyses isolated a consistent module of 16p11.2 genes, as well as a module that was highly enriched forconstrained genes (ExAC pLI â¥0.9), autism associated genes, early fetal development coexpression networks derived from BrainSpan, and neurological phenotypes andprocesses. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were enriched in this âconstrained âmodule network; moreover, DEGs from the Kctd13 mouse coalesced into this samemodule (cortex enrichment p ,7.82E 41), suggesting overlap in altered transcriptional networks between full length CNV and deletion of KCTD13 alone. These analysesidentify a tissue speci ï¬c impact of 16p11.2 RGD that converges on a module of co expressed genes that are intolerant to genetic perturbation and associated with criticalprocesses in human neurodevelopment.

The homeobox protein NKX6 2 is a transcription factor regulating multiple developmental processes with a main role in oligoden drocyte differentiation and regulation of myelin speci ï¬c gene expression. Materials and Methods: Whole exome sequencing (WES) and homozygosity mapping of selected patients from three unrelated families was undertaken. The variants identi ï¬ed were validated by Sanger sequencing and cosegregation analysis. Results: Five affected subjects (three unrelated families) were documented to share biallelic inactivating mutationsaffecting the NKX6 2 homeobox domain. A trio based whole exome sequencing analysis in the ï¬rst family detected a homozygous frameshift change [c.606delinsTA;p.(Lys202Asnfs*?)]. In the second family, homozygosity mapping coupled to whole exome sequencing identi ï¬ed a homozygous nucleotide substitution (c.565G>T) introdu cing a premature stop codon (p. Glu189*). In the third family, whole exome sequencing established compound heterozygosity for a non conservative missense changeaffecting a key residue participating in DNA binding (c.599G>A; p. Arg200Gln) and a nonsense substitution (c.589C>T; p. Gln197*), in both affected siblings. Theclinical presentation was homogeneous, with four subjects having severe motor delays, nystagmus and absent head control, and one individual showing gross motor delay atthe age of 6 months.

Genetic bases are prominent riskfactors for both disorders. Among others, loss of function mutations in CHD8 gene represents a recurrent risk factor for ASD, while CHD2 is more frequently mutated in epi lepsy. Thus, the sole reduction in CHD8 orCHD2 expres sion is able to cause cellular and molecular phenotypes that are key hallmarks to follow and rescue in assessing newtherapeutic approaches. Particularly, we aim to test SINEUPs, a novel class of synthetic antisense long non coding RNAs able to increasethe translation of target proteins to physiological level without affecting transcription to rescue the phenotypes caused by CHD8 orCHD2 haploinsuf ï¬ciency. Since the activity of SINEUP depends on two domains, an effector domain required for translation enhancement and a binding domain conferring target speci ï¬city, we designed SINEUP molecules able to recognize the initial and internal methionines of CHD8 and CHD2 proteins. We then proceeded to test the ef ï¬cacy of different SINEUPs on neural progenitors. From our preliminary observations, SINEUPs targeting internal methionines are more ef ï¬cient in stimulating CHD8 and CHD2 protein production, thusrepresenting a valid target to be further tested in patients â derived cell lines and in zebra ï¬sh, an in vivo model of the disorders. In conclusion, our studies represents the ï¬rst step towards the development of new types of RNA based therapy, with implications for a large repertory of presently incurablegenetic diseases. F.

Theamphibian Xenopus tropicalis is extremely well positioned for this approach. It shares with zebra ï¬sh the aquatic habitat and easy manipulations associated with its external devel opment. However, it manifests unique features making it a powerful organism for modeling human genetic disease. (1) unlike zebra ï¬sh,Xenopus tropicalis has a true diploid genome, precluding redundancy. (2) Its genome shows high synteny with humans, greatly facilitating identi ï¬cation of disease orthologs. (3) Gene manipulations can be restrictedto speci ï¬c tissues and organs via targeted blastomere injection. We have recently generated the ï¬rst genetic cancer models in Xenopus tropicalis . Via mosaic targeting of the tumor suppressor gene apcwe generated tadpoles that rapidly (< 1.5 months) and ef ï¬ciently (>90%) developed a range of neoplasia characteristic for Familial AdenomatousPolyposis (Van Nieuwenhuysen et al., Oncoscience 2015). Similarly, we found that rb1/rbl1 double mosaic mutant tadpoles rapidly develop retinoblastoma (Naert et al. Sci. Rep. 2016). More recent work also indicates the possibility of modeling Li Fraumeni, T cell acute lymphoblastic leu kemia and pancreatic neuroendocrine cancer. The rapidkinetics of tumor development in Xenopus pave the way for their use as pre clinical model, providing unique possibi lities for fast identi ï¬cation of modi ï¬er genes and novel drug targets. We present our ï¬rst promising results with multi plexed gene targeting in desmoid tumors. We believe that these models offer a unique experimental platform to con tribute to the ï¬eld of human cancer and medical genetics. D. Dimitrakopoulou: None. T. Naert: None. D. Tulkens: None. R.

HDGC is deadly for those expressingclinical phenotype, but presymptomatic testing allows dis ease prevention or early diagnosis in mutation carriers through risk reduction gastrectomy and yearly breast MRI,discharging ~50% of non carriers. As Health Care Provider of ERN GENTURIS, we aim to evaluate the economic impact of genetic counselling, presymptomatic diagnosisand multidisciplinary care for the National Health Service (NHS), and the clinical and psycho social implications for HDGC families. Material and Methods: We evaluated outputs of struc tured oncogenetics and high risk consultations in 111 individuals from 7 HDGC families by consulting clinical/ï¬nancial records, and assessed its psycho social impact by applying an emotional distress scale (HADS) to 70/111 individuals. Results: From 2011 2016, we screened 111 individuals, from which 53% tested negative (n ,58;30M:28F) and were discharged from follow up each costing 200 â¬to the Hospital. 47% (n ,53;26M:27F) tested positive. From 7 probands, 2 were diagnosed with LBC and remain alive after curative surgery, while 5 diagnosed with DGC aredeceased. The hospital expenses with probands range from 30 50K â¬independently of cancer type. Costs with carriers opting for prophylactic approaches range from 4 8K â¬ (higher cost/females), except if disease is identi ï¬ed after theï¬rst high risk consultation, raising the cost to 27K â¬but life saving. Those opting for surveillance, cost ~1Kâ¬/patient. Concerning psychologic impact, carriers demon strate higher levels of distress than non carriers. Conclusion: Structured healthcare in HDGC economic ally bene ï¬ts NHS, is life saving for carriers, reassuring non carriers. L. Garrido: None. T. NÃ©rcio: None. R. Leal: None. R. GuimarÃ£es: None.

29116,"Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS) and Whole Exome sequencing (WES) for diagnostic and research purposesgenerate a large volume of raw data. Previous ethical and legal discussions concerning genomic data management have mainly focused on concerns related to interpreta tion of the results and the return of both primary and secondary ï¬ndings from these tests. Yet to date, issues related to the storage and re turn of primary sequencing data (such as bam (Binary Alignment) or fastq ï¬les (unaligned reads)) that all ow both the regeneration of primary results and the reanalysis of data have receivedfar less attention, particularly in the clinical setting. This is despite the huge potential f or long term data storage to lead to future data re analy sis and reinterpretation in light of new evidence. In this paper, we critically appraise three main issues, namely, data storage policies and practices of clinical laboratories, patients âaccess to raw data, and sharing of raw data by individuals. We argue that there is a need for well established and transparent raw genomic dat a retention and returning policies in order to enable patients to practice their rights to access raw genomic data . In addition, pr ofessional communities could guide laboratories in adoptingbest practices for the storage and return of raw data, and introduce uniformity to these practices. As WES and WGS become more embedded in diagnostics, it istimely to consider how current data storage policies align with patients ârights and interests to access raw data, and how these rights can be managed in the clinicalsetting.

Deep convolutional neural networks such as DeepGestalt in Face2Gene have been trained on thousands of patient photos with con ï¬rmed molecular diagnoses and learned phenotype representations of multiple disorders. These systems of arti ï¬cial intelligence support clinicians in the diagnostic workup of patients andeven excel human experts in certain classi ï¬cation tasks. We therefore wondered whether this unprecedented sensitivity to detect mutation speci ï¬c patterns in the facial gestalt could also be used to reveal information about gene function. Materials and Methods: We designed the knowledge base Deep Phenotyping for Deep Learning (DPDL) as a public resource to compile similarity scores from NGP tools and performed a cluster analysis on currently 1216 caseswith monogenic disorders. Results: A prominent cluster was formed by BRAF, PTPN11, NRAS and other genes of the MAPKinasepathway that result in phenotypes such as Noonan, LEOPARD or cardiofaciocutaneous syndrome and which are considered similar. Likewise, many genes linked toinborn errors of metabolism also clustered, mirroring a higher level feature that is referred to by clinicians as âcoarse facies â. Furthermore, we also found genes involved in chromatin remodeling to be near neighbors, even if no superordinate joint feature exists in medical terminology to describe the associated diseases. Conclusions: We were able to reproduce molecular interactions by information encoded in the facial gestalt by using NGP tools. Thus, the phenotype space exploration isa promising subject in the characterization of gene function. T. Hsieh: None. N. Hajjir: None. J. T. Pantel: None. M. Mensah: None. M. Zhao: None. J.

29119,"1University of Trieste, Trieste, Italy,2IRCCS Burlo Garofolo, Trieste, Italy Introduction To shed light on the genetics of ARHL (the most common sensory disorder in the elderly) we analysed a large cohort of patients and developed a series of animal models. Methods 46 genes, selected on the basis of GWAS, animal models and literature updates, were analysed in 464 ARHL patients. After data ï¬ltering, the most promising results were validated by either âin vitro âorâin vivo â studies. Results We identi ï¬edSLC9A3R1 as a new ARHL gene. An ultra rare (MAF: 7,70E 05) missense variant was detected in 2 unrelated male patients showing severe to profound high frequency hearing loss. The variant, pre dicted as damaging, was not present in 1071 matched controls and protein modelling con ï¬rmed its pathogenic effect on protein âs structure. In situ hybridization showed Slc9a3r1 expression in zebra ï¬sh inner ear. A zebra ï¬sh KI model, using CRISPR Cas9 technology, was generated,revealing a reduced auditory response at all frequencies in Slc9a3r1 / compared to Slc9a3r1 +/+and Slc9a3r1 +/ . Additional phenotypic analyses demonstrated no abnorm alities in the anatomy or number of hair cells or in the volume of the stato acoustic ganglion, however, a sig niï¬cant variation in the total volume of the saccular otolith which is responsible for sound detection, was observed in Slc9a3r1 / compared to Slc9a3r1 +/+(while the utricular otolith, necessary for balance, was not affected, inagreement with the human phenotype). Conclusions Our data strongly support SLC9A3R1 role in the pathogenesis of ARHL in both human and zebra ï¬sh. Larger cohorts of patients should be further analyzed to understand the overall contribution of SLC9A3R1 to ARHL. A. Morgan: None. M. Brumat: None. M. Cocca: None. M. Di Stazio: None. S.

Prior genetic linkage pinpointed the disease locus to chromosome6q16 and 5p15. The aim was to identify causative variants and further the understanding of the disease mechanism. Materials & Methods: CRISPR technology was used to reproduce a non coding duplication between IRX1 and ADAMTS16 (chr5) recurrently identi ï¬ed in NCMD families866 J. del Picchiaby whole genome sequencing. Gene expression analysis was veri ï¬ed on the developing eye and limb bud. Chromo some conformation capture (c HI C) and chromatin immu noprecipitation performed on the same tissues, mapped chromatin architectural folding and de ï¬ned regulatory elements. Results: A non coding duplication (chr5) was identi ï¬ed as an ancestral allele in 12 NCMD families. Expression of PRDM13 (chr6) was substantially elevated in eye but not limb bud tissue in the mouse model versus control. c Hi C at the 5p locus showed unique chromatin interactions in developing wild type eye versus limb bud, suggestingdistinct tissue speci ï¬c regulation. Conclusions: The eye speci ï¬c over expression of PRDM13 , a previously suggested candidate, provides the ï¬rst molecular evidence that elevated PRDM13 expression may be the origin of the phenotype. It also represents the ï¬rst molecular evidence to link the two loci biologically. The possible interaction between the putative element and subsequent PRDM13 expression control remains unknown. Chromatin organization ï¬ndings highlight the relevance of tissue speci ï¬c DNA contacts in development and disease.

Whole genome sequencing identi ï¬ed a unique variant (c.20 +544G>T) in this locus, within a regulatory region in intron 1 of GRHL2 .T a r g e t e dsequencing identi ï¬ed the same variant in three additional unsolved PPCD families, including a de novo occurrence that suggests this is a recurrent mutation. Two further unique variants were identi ï¬ed in intron 1 of GRHL2 (c.20 +257delT and c.20 +133delA) in unrelated PPCD famil ies. GRHL2 is a transcription factor that suppressesepithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) and is a direct transcriptional repressor of ZEB1 .ZEB1 mutations leading to haploinsuf ï¬ciency cause PPCD3. We pre viously identi ï¬ed promoter mutations in OVOL2 , a gene not normally expressed in the corneal endothelium, as the cause of PPCD1. OVOL2 drives mesenchymal to epithelial transition (MET) by directly inhibiting EMT inducing transcription factors, such as ZEB1 . Here, we demonstrate that the GRHL2 regulatory variants identi ï¬ed in PPCD4 individuals induce increased transcriptional activity in vitro. Furthermore, although GRHL2 is not expressed in corneal endothelial cells in control tissue, wedetected aberrant ectopic expression of GRHL2 in the corneal âendothelium âin PPCD4 patient tissue. GRHL2 patient corneal âendothelial âcells also ectopically express the epithelial markers E Cadherin and Cytokeratin 7 indicating they have transitioned to an epithelial like cell type.

Among those, IFT140 is implicated in a variety of phenotypes ranging from isolated retinis pigmentosa to more syndromic cases such as the Bardet Biedl syndrome. Materials and Methods: Clinical characterizations, whole genome (4 individuals) and targeted exome sequencing (~350 patients) and bioinformatics analysis were performed onciliopathy families. Patients âskinï¬broblasts were analyzed to assess the pathogenicity of the causative mutations. Results: Using whole genome sequencing in patients with uncharacterized ciliopathies, we identi ï¬ed a novel recurrent tandem duplication of exon 27 to 30 (6.7 kb) in IFT140 , c.3454 488_4182 +2588dup p. (Tyr1152_Thr1394dup), missed by whole exome sequen cing. Pathogenicity of the mutation was assessed on the patients âskin ï¬broblasts. Several hundreds of patients with a ciliopathy phenotype were screened and biallelic mutations were identi ï¬ed in 11 families representing 12 pathogenic variants of which 7 are novel. Among thoseunrelated families especially with a Mainzer Saldino syndrome, 8 carried the same tandem duplication (2 at the homozygous state and 6 at the heterozygous state). Conclusions: We demonstrated the implication of structural variations in IFT140 related diseases expanding its mutation spectrum. We also provide evidences for aunique genomic event mediated by an Alu Alu recombina tion occurring on a shared haplotype. We con ï¬rm that whole genome sequencing can be instrumental in the abilityto detect structural variants for genomic disorders. V. Geoffroy: None. C. Stoetzel: None. S. Schei decker: None. E.

Autosomal recessive disorders have a high prevalence in con sanguineous populations, due to the extensive genomic regions of homozygosity that include alleles identical by descent. Hence, consanguineous families are the bestsource to identify novel causative autosomal recessive genes. We have analyzed more than 150 consanguineous families with diverse phenotypes related to visualimpairment. We used a strategy that combines exome sequencing of a proband and genotyping of the entire family. In two different families, we found two differenthomozygous loss of function (LoF) variants in the DNMBP gene (OMIM#611282); a stopgain (NM_015221: c.811C>T:p.
