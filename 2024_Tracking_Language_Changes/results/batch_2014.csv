20708,"RAS proteins are small monomeric GTPases that function as molecular swit ches controlling a major intracellular signaling network that, depending on the cellular context, guides diverse biological functions, including proliferation, cell fate determination, survival, migration, differentiation, and senescence. RAS signaling is switched on upon stimulation by numerous cytokines, hormones, and growth factors, and mediates the appropriate cell response to external sti muli through the regulation of transcription, cytoskeletal rearrangement, and metabolism. Within this network, signal flow through the RAF MEK ERK pa thway, the first identified mitogen associated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade, mediates early and late developmental processes, including determination of morphology, organogenesis, synaptic plasticity, and growth. Signaling through the RAS MAPK cascade is tightly controlled, and its enhanced activation has been known for decades to represent a major event in oncoge nesis. Activating somatic RAS gene mutations occur in approximately 30% of human cancers, and upregulation of this signaling pathway can also result from enhanced function of upstream signal transducers or RAS effectors, and inef ficient function of feedback mechanisms. Unexpectedly, discoveries derived from a massive disease gene hunting effort have recently established a novel scenario in which the upregulation of this signaling cascade underlies a group of clinically related developmental disor ders, the RASopathies, characterized by facial dysmorphism, cardiac defects, reduced postnatal growth, variable cognitive deficits, ectodermal and muscu loskeletal anomalies, and increased risk for certain malignancies. These dis orders are caused by mutations in genes encoding RAS proteins, regulators of RAS function, modulators of RAS interaction with effectors or downstream signal transducers. Based on the relatively high prevalence of some of these disorders (i.e., Noonan syndrome and neurofibromatosis type 1), the dysregu lation of this signaling pathway represents one of the most common events af fecting developmental processes. These discoveries have also provided us with unpredicted molecular mechanisms converging toward the dysregulation of this signaling network.",2014
20709,"The Hdh gene arose with no CAGs in Dictyostelium discoideum ( Dd), around 800 million year ago before the protostome deuterostome divergence (Zuccato, Physiol Rev 2010). The CAG then has appeared in and is unique to the deute rostome branch. Two CAGs are found in Hdh in sea urchin (Strongylocentrotus purpuratus, Sp), the first specie to carry a primitive nervous system, and two CAGs are present in amphioxus (Branchiostoma floridae, Bf), the first specie to exhibit a rudimental hollow nerve tube and cephalization. Four CAG are found in Hdh from the more evolved fishes, amphibians, and birds. The CAG further expands in mammals and reaches its maximum length in human. A study of 278 normal subjects revealed an increase in grey matter with increasing length of the CAG repeat (Muhlau, PlosOne 2012), indicating that CAG size could influ ence normal brain structure. Our hypothesis is that the progressive increase in CAG length in the Hdh gene observed during evolution may be implicated in the evolutionary changes that have occurred in the developing and adult ner vous system throughout vertebrate phylogeny, with a possible role for the CAG in newly emerging cognitive functions in the mammalian brain. We have now collected the Hdh gene from new species both in the protostome and deutero stome branch. In addition to further analyze the CAG tract during mammalian evolution we have collected genomic DNA and amplified the CAG tract from non anthropomorphic and anthropomorphic primates. Our reconstruction of htt phylogeny supports further that the CAG tract expands during deuterosto me evolution and seems to correlate with the appearance and/or evolution of progressively more complex nervous systems.",2014

20711,"We initially observed 3 unrelated patients with fevers, livedo reticularis, vas culopathy, and early onset recurrent ischemic strokes. We performed exome sequencing on affected patients and their unaffected parents that pointed to recessively inherited predicted deleterious mutations in CECR1, encoding adenosine deaminase 2 (ADA2). All mutations are either novel or present at low frequency (<0.001) in several large databases, consistent with the reces sive inheritance. Candidate gene screening was done in additional 6 patients. Nine patients shared 4/9 missense mutations in CECR1 along with conserved haplotypes. Computer modeling based on the crystal structure of the human ADA2 suggests that CECR1 mutations either disrupt protein stability or impair enzyme activity. All patients had at least a 10 fold reduction in serum and plas ma concentrations of ADA2, and reduced ADA2 specific adenosine deaminase activity. ADA2 is expressed predominantly in myeloid cells and is a secreted protein. Animal models suggest that ADA2 is the prototype for a family of grow th factors (ADGFs). Although there is no murine homolog of CECR1, there are 2 zebrafish homologs, Cecr1a and Cecr1b. Knockdown of a zebrafish ADA2 homolog caused intracranial hemorrhages and neutropenia, phenotypes that were rescued by wild type but not mutant human CECR1. Skin, liver, and brain biopsies from patients demonstrated vasculopathic changes characterized by compromised endothelial integrity, endothelial cellular activation, and inflam mation although ADA2 is not expressed in the endothelial cells. Our data sug gest that loss of function mutations in CECR1 are associated with a spectrum of vascular and inflammatory phenotypes ranging from early onset recurrent stroke to systemic vasculopathy and/or vasculitis.",2014
20712,"The discovery of highly conserved non coding elements has unleashed a race to elucidate their functional significance. A class of intragenic highly conserved non coding elements has previously been associated with regulating levels of core spliceosomal components, which affects the alternative splicing of down stream genes. These regulatory exons contain a premature termination codon, and trigger nonsense mediated mRNA decay (NMD) when included in the as sociated transcript. In this study we identify mutations in one such exon in SN RPB as the cause of cerebro costo mandibular syndrome (CCMS). CCMS, one of the last unsolved classical Mendelian disorders, is a multiple malformation syndrome characterized by posterior rib gaps and micrognathia. The identi fied mutations fall within exonic splicing silencer sequences. We show by both qRT PCR and a minigene reporter assay that these mutations cause increased inclusion of the alternative exon and decreased overall expression of SNRPB. This decrease is predicted to influence the splicing of a diverse but limited number of downstream target genes. Our data provide the first evidence for the functional importance of this class of conserved elements in the regulation of human development. We suggest that this exon, which is highly conserved across placental mammals but not other vertebrates, accords a subtle regulato ry role to SNRPB which may have contributed to the complexity of mammalian development.",2014

An accurate genetic diagnosis is fundamental for pediatric patients with rare genetic disorders to improve disease management, access to resources, and recurrence risk counseling. A diagnosis also provides psychosocial benefits to families. The Finding of Rare Disease GEnes (FORGE) Canada project, which sought to identify novel rare disease genes by whole exome sequencing (WES), shows that 36% of the solved disorders were secondary to mutations in known genes; 95 known disease genes were identified out of 264 total disorders stu died. All patients had undergone standard of care genetic testing in Canada and no diagnosis was forthcoming. Thus, for 104 families, WES provided a clinical diagnosis; 24 of these were dominant (most de novo), 68 were autosomal reces sive, four were X linked mutations and one family had two disorders. Although many of the 104 families who received a clinical diagnosis were ascertained because of familial recurrence or consanguineous parents, 91 single affected patients without a family history were also included for WES. This latter subset of the above 264 disorders are representative of what geneticists often see in the clinic and had a diagnostic rate of 43%. Thus, WES would seem to be an ef ficient and cost effective means of clinical diagnosis for many patients who are currently undiagnosed. Our findings suggest that patients with genetically he terogeneous disorders or sibling recurrence are the most likely to be diagnosed by WES. Canada is building on the success of these 104 diagnosed families to develop a national framework for clinical exome sequencing.",2014
20714,"We sequenced hundreds of single cell transcriptomes to decipher the cell to cell transcriptional variation. Starting from a homogeneous cell population of human female primary fibroblasts from one individual, we used the C1 Single Cell Auto Prep System to capture individual cells and to generate pre amplified cDNA for next generation sequencing. On average, 9322 genes per single cell (RPKM >0.3) were detected, representing ~50% of the total genes detected by the bulk sample containing millions of cells. We noted a wide spectrum of tran scriptional heterogeneity. Correlation analysis between single cells showed an average coefficient of 62% (0.3 0.9). A large number of detected genes are cell specific with gene mRNA levels variable between single cells. Moreover, we identified cell specific novel exons, multitude of alternative spliced isoforms and 3Ã¢ÂÂUTR isoforms due to alternative polyadenylation. Hence, 1% of exons showed difference for exon inclusion between single cells and 10% of 3Ã¢ÂÂUTR contained alternative transcript termination sites. To further assess the differential allelic expression at the single cell level, WGS has been performed on this sample. Our data revealed that both alleles are ac tively transcribed for most of the detected genes. Interestingly, we observed a skewed monoallelic distribution in single cells in a given snapshot of time. In deed, for most of the genes, we detected one transcribed allele at the time in an individual cell. For a specific gene, rare are the individual cells expressing both alleles simultaneously. The results were validated in fibroblasts from a second individual. We will also provide a comprehensive survey of imprinted genes, X inactivation and escape. S. E.A and E. T .D. laboratories contributed equally.",2014
20715,"Severe intellectual disability (ID) occurs in 0.5% of newborns and is thought to be largely genetic in origin. The extensive genetic heterogeneity of the dis order requires a genome wide detection of all types of genetic variation. Mi croarray studies and more recently exome sequencing have demonstrated the importance of de novo copy number variations (CNVs) and single nucleotide variations (SNVs) in ID, but the majority of cases remains undiagnosed. Here we applied whole genome sequencing (WGS) to 50 patients with severe ID and their unaffected parents. All patients were negative after extensive genetic prescreening, including microarray based CNV studies and exome sequencing. Notwithstanding this prescreening, de novo SNVs affecting the coding region provided a conclusive genetic cause in 13 patients and a possible cause for ano ther 8 patients. In addition, we identified 7 clinically relevant de novo CNVs as well as one recessively inherited compound heterozygous CNV. These CNVs included single exon and intraexonic deletions of known ID genes as well as in terchromosomal duplications. Local realignment of sequence reads allowed the mapping of most of these CNVs at single nucleotide resolution level and provi ded positional information for duplicated sequences. These results show that de novo mutations and CNVs affecting the coding region are the major cause of severe ID. Genome sequencing can be applied as a single genetic test to reliab ly identify and characterize the comprehensive spectrum of genetic variation, providing a genetic diagnosis in the majority of patients with severe ID.",2014
20716,"In 2013, the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) is sued Recommendations for incidental findings in clinical exome and genome sequencing. The Recommendations were written by a Working Group of 14 me dical geneticists, laboratory geneticists, genetic counselors and ethicists who met regularly for 14 months to draft them. The draft Recommendations were presented for commentary in a public forum at the 2012 Annual Meeting of the ACMG, reviewed by 15 additional experts, and reviewed several times by the Board of the ACMG before being issued in March, 2013. The Recommendations ABSTRACTS PLENARY LECTURES ESHG 2014 | MILAN, ITALY | WWW. ESHG. ORG 6Back to inde x were recently amended in March, 2014. The Recommendations were consensus based, as empirical data on populati on penetrance and medical outcomes of identifying incidental variants are not available. The Recommendations called for molecular laboratories performing clinical sequencing for any indication on patients of any age to examine 56 ge nes associated with 24 actionable conditions for pathogenic variants. The Re commendations now suggest that patients be offered an option to decline these tests as a group at the time they are ordered. Several clinical sequencing laboratories in the US have adopted the Recom mendations and over 1000 reports of incidental findings have been issued. The incidence of the ACMG variants in unselected populations appears to be 2 4%. Additional data from our experimental laboratory of translational genomics on the issue of incidental findings will be presented.",2014
20717,"In 2013 the Ã¢ÂÂ American College of Medical Genetics and GenomicsÃ¢ÂÂ (ACMG) pu blished a list of 56 genes that are proposed specific targets of a search for pa thogenic variants in both children and adults (Green et al.). These genes are as sociated with diseases with an indication for immediate medical intervention of the patient or of a family member. The publication asserts that, in principle, the necessary patient data are available following a NGS procedure and therefore cannot be ignored. For purposes of clarity, the vast majority of these variants are removed during the various filtering stages of the normal trio analysis pro cess and that identification of these variants will require additional actions. During the American Society of Human Genetics meeting 2013, it was argued that consensus on a basic list of clearly pathogenic variants in the relevant ge nes is essential if this form of diagnosis is to be implemented in genetic diagno stics. A disadvantage of the approach as proposed by the ACMG (analysis of the entire gene, rather than focusing on known pathogenic gene variants) is that variants will be detected that have not been previously reported and/or are of undefined pathogenicity. This could result in considerable distress for the patient and family. To avoid this, only selected variants in the genes nominated by the ACMG will be analysed. Another point of discussion is whether conditions that manifest later in life should be investigated in children. While the ACMG is in favour, Ploem et al. are of a different opinion: Ã¢ÂÂWhen it comes to the unsolicited findings of NGS diagno stics in a young child, the interests of the child prevail over any wishes of the parents (not) to receive certain information.Ã¢ÂÂ (NTVG 2014;158:A6757). This is consistent with ESHG recommendations (EJHG 2013;21:580 4)).Ã¢ÂÂIn case of testing minors, guidelines need to be established as to what unsolicited information should be disclosed in order to balance the autonomy and interests of the child and the parental rights and needs (not) to receive information that may be in the interest of their (future) familyÃ¢ÂÂA solution to these conflicting interests is as follows: where the index patient is a minor, a genetic predisposition for Ã¢ÂÂlate onsetÃ¢ÂÂ diseases for which immedi ate medical treatment is indicated will only be sought in parents. This is made possible by the setup of trio analysis in which variant lists are available for each parent. Genetic variants that result in clinical manifestations that in require direct in tervention during childhood will be analysed in the index patient, even when a minor.",2014
20718,"Whole genome sequencing (WGS) of the human genome has a great potential to identify the genetic component of health problems, and probably, in the near future, at a lower cost than that of the current techniques. Proof of principle regarding the clinical utility of WGS followed by whole genome analysis (WGA) has been reported, especially for rare diseases. The Public and Professional Policy Committee of ESHG developed recommendations on whole genome se quencing for health care (EJHG 2013;21:580 4).As a first element of the discussion, we have to consider all stakeholders invol ved: patients looking for a diagnosis, primary care physicians referring patients and following them for many years after the diagnosis, laboratory experts and clinical geneticists, legal and ethical experts. If a new technology is being im plemented, a mutual learning process starts. Structures are needed for sharing experiences and establish testing guidelines at local, national and international levels. When in the clinical setting either targeted sequencing or analysis of genome data is possible, it is preferable to use a targeted approach first in order to avoid unsolicited findings or findings that cannot be interpreted. The ACMG advoca tes (Genet Med 2013;15:565 74) that there is a potential for the recognition and reporting of incidental or secondary findings unrelated to the indication for ordering the sequencing but of medical value for patient care. The ESHG position is that whenever possible, such testing should be targeted to genome regions linked to the indication. Wider testing requires a justification in terms of necessity and proportionality. Adding screening targets to a diagnostic test violates the necessity criterion. Imposing this extra testing upon patients who need an answer to their clinical problem is at odds with respect for autonomy (Science 2013;341:958 9). Guidelines for the informed consent procedure in WGA must be developed (Hum Mutat. 2013;34:1322 8). Also in a targeted analysis it is possible to detect an unsolicited genetic variant, indicative of serious health problems (either in the person tested or his or her close relatives) that allow for treatment or prevention. In principle, a health care professional should report such genetic variants (EJHG 2013;21:580 4). To prepare the health care professionals for WGS in health care, a sustained effort at genetic education is required at various levels: in primary care to in form and refer people appropriately, and in specialized care to counsel or refer patients, and to discuss and interpret genetic test results adequately. Genetic experts should engage in discussing new developments in genetics, and explain the pros and cons of genetic testing and screening in clinical and commercial settings to inform the public and raise public awareness. Enhancing genetic li teracy in patients and the lay public will help to involve wider society in this debate.",2014
20719,"Gene targeting provides the means for modifying any gene in any desired man ner in an intact, living animal, the mouse. This technology permits the evalua tion of the function of genes in mammals. Because nearly all biological phe nomena are mediated or influenced by the activity of genes, this methodology permits the analysis of the most complex biological processes such as develop ment, learning, normal and aberrant behavior, cancer, immunology and a mul titude of congenital human diseases. In the past, gene targeting has been used primarily to generate Ã¢ÂÂknockoutÃ¢ÂÂ mice, that is mice in which the chosen gene has been disrupted in the germline, such that every cell in the mouse carries the mutations. This methodology permits evaluation of the function of that gene in the intact mouse. However, many, if not most, genes have multiple functions. If one of those functions is critical to the survival of the mouse, then subsequent functions of that gene in the mouse cannot be evaluated by the above means. This problem can be circumvented by generating conditional mutations, that restrict the effects of the mutation temporally, spatially (to defined sets of cells or tissue), or both. In mice, conditional mutagenesis is achieved by combining gene targeting, which is achieved through homologous recombination, with a site specific recombination system, such as Cre/loxP or Flp/FRT . Cre and Flp are recombinases that mediate recombination between specific, short DNA se quences, loxP and FRT , respectively. Gene targeting is used to flank your chosen gene with either loxP or FRT sites in the mouse germline. By restricting the production of the Cre or Flp recombinase to either a specific set of cells, a cho sen temporal period, or both, within the developing or adult mouse, the gene is only excised from the genome of the mouse, in those selected cells, during that chosen temporal period, or both. I will describe a number of applications of gene targeting and conditional mutagenesis derived in our laboratory that address interesting biological questions from modeling human cancer to neu ropsychiatric disorder in the mouse.",2014

These approaches have enabled heterogeneity in gene expression levels across populations of cells to be characterized as well as facilitating the identification of new, and potentially physiologically relevant, sub populations of cells. However, to fully exploit such data and to answer these questions, it is ne cessary to develop robust computational methods that take account of both technical noise and underlying, potentially confounding, variables such as the cell cycle. In this presentation I will begin by briefly describing how we used spike ins to quantify technical noise in single cell RNA seq data, thus facilitating iden tification of genes with more variation in expression levels across cells than expected by chance. Subsequently, I will discuss a computational approach that uses latent variable models to account for potentially confounding fac tors such as the cell cycle before applying it to study the differentiation of Th2 cells. I will show that accounting for cell to cell correlations due to the cell cycle allows identification of otherwise obscured sub populations of cells that correspond to different stages along the path to fully differentiated Th2 cells.

Classi fication based on clinical, neuroradiological and neuropathological charac teristics divided PCH into eight subtypes; the underlying genetic cause has been identified in six PCH types (PCH1, PCH2, and PCH4 6 and 8). PCH2 represents the most frequent form of PCHs and typical clinical features are respiratory and feeding difficulties at birth, dyskinesia and chorea, severe impairment of cognitive and motor development, progressive microcepha ly, and frequent death in late infancy or early childhood. MRI imaging in PCH2 shows brainstem and cerebellar hypoplasia, with the cerebellar he mispheres more affected than the vermis. In patients with PCH2, 4 and 5, biallelic mutations in genes encoding three subunits of the heterotetrameric transfer RNA (tRNA) splicing endonuclease complex, TSEN54 , TSEN2 , and TSEN34 have been identified. PCH shows significant overlapping features with microcephaly with pontine and cerebellar hypoplasia (MICPCH), gene rally associated with loss of function CASK mutations. The classical MICPCH phenotype can be found in females who typically have moderate to severe intellectual disability and progressive microcephaly with pontine and cere bellar hypoplasia. Possible findings are ophthalmologic anomalies and sen sorineural hearing loss. Males with a CASK mutation have also been iden tified. The phenotypic spectrum ranges from severe intellectual disability and MICPCH, or early infantile epileptic encephalopathy to mild X linked intellectual disability (XLID) with or without nystagmus.

20728,"Neuronal migration disorders such as malformations of cortical develop ment are frequent causes of epilepsy and intellectual disability. Disrupted biological and cellular processes such as neuronal progenitors proliferation, neuronal migration, and cortical organization, are traditionally used as a basis for the classification of MCD. Etiologies of these disorders are hetero geneous and genetic studies in humans and mice have identified a spectrum of mutations in genes involved in an array of crucial processes that often disrupt the development of the cerebral cortex. Aside from genes such as ARX, GPR56 and WDR62, the importance of genes encoding cytoskeletal proteins has become evident. For example, mutations in DCX and LIS1, both of which encode proteins involved in MT homeostasis, are associated with a large spectrum of neuronal migration disorders. Moreover, MCD associated with mutations in ÃÂ± or ÃÂ² tubulin encoding genes such as TUBA1A, TUBB2B, TUBB3 and TUBB5, have been also described. These tubulin related corti cal dysgenesis are thought to involve a combination of abnormal neuronal proliferation, migration and differentiation. More recently, we reported the association between mutations in TUBG1, DYNC1H1, KIF2A and KIF5C, and diverse forms of malformations of cortical development with or without microcephaly. We further showed that the mutations in these MTs related proteins: KIF5C, KIF2A and DYNC1H1 affect ATP hydrolysis, productive pro tein folding and microtubule binding, respectively. In addition, we showed by in utero electroporation that in vivo downexpression by shRNA of mouse, Tubb3 and Tubg1, as well as expression of Kif2a mutants, interferes with proper neuronal polarization and migration, morphogenesis and intermedi ate progenitor proliferation.

Ge netic testing and providing information about genetic predisposition may enable early disease detection, targeted surveillance, and may lead to effec tive prevention strategies and behavioral change. However, the impact of ge netic information on peopleÃ¢ÂÂs perceptions may be limited. Most people are unfamiliar with probabilistic thinking and find it hard to understand risks. Moreover, risks are experienced differently depending on the characteristics of the risk. A risk is more than a number. It is not only the probability, the quantification of the uncertainty, but also the nature of the risk, the severity of the consequences and the degree of control what matters. People process and evaluate information about potential risks in two different ways: analy tical rational if possible, but always intuitive affective.

We report long term clinical results obtained in an homogeneous group of 154 patients presenting with corneal opacification and visual loss due to chemical and thermal burn dependent limbal stem cell deficiency. The corneal epitheli um and the visual acuity of these patients have been restored by grafts of autologous cultured limbal keratinocytes. In post hoc analyses, success was associated with the percentage of p63 bright holoclone forming stem cells in culture. Graft failure was also associated with the type of initial ocular damage and postoperative complications. Mutations in genes encoding the basement membrane component laminin 5 (LAM5) cause junctional epider molysis bullosa (JEB), a devastating and often fatal skin adhesion disorder. Epidermal stem cells transduced with a retroviral vector expressing the ÃÂ²3 cDNA can generate genetically corrected cultured epidermal grafts able to permanently restore the skin of patients affected by LAM5 ÃÂ²3 deficient JEB. The implication of these results for the gene therapy of different genetic skin diseases will be discussed.",2014

We and others have recently established that mosaicism for many of the same mutations underlies a spectrum of disorders of segmental overgrowth, ranging from isolated macrodactyly to catastrophic overgrowth affecting lar ge parts of the body and several tissues, and commonly associated with com plex vascular anomalies. Identification of the underlying signalling defect in affected tissues has immediately suggested that pharmacological targeting of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway may offer the first rational, effective thera peutic approach for these disorders.

20742,"Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy was one of the first monogenic cardiovascu lar disorders to be understood at the molecular level. Twenty years after the discovery of the first disease gene, HCM is still seen principally to be a disease of the sarcomere. At the biophysical level, the contractile protein mutations that cause HCM are seen to be activating in that they enhance Ca(2+) sensitivity, maximal force production, and ATPase activity. These defects then entrain secondary disturbances of energy deficiency and alte red Ca(2+) handling that appear to be major common paths leading to the phenotype of hypertrophy and risk of sudden cardiac death. Importantly, these functional consequences of HCM mutations may lend themselves to specifically targeted approaches to disease modifying therapy for HCM, and phase I/II clinical trials have been completed or are underway. In contrast, dilated cardiomyopathy is caused by mutations in genes enco ding many different classes of proteins with very diverse roles in cardio myocyte function, e.g. ranging from the nuclear envelope through to the contractile and force transduction apparatus. This indicates that the DCM phenotype is the end result of disparate pathways that lead to myocyte loss and fibrous replacement, suggesting that finding broadly applicable approa ches to disease modifying therapy may be difficult. In the subset of DCM caused by sarcomeric mutations the picture is clearer, and may lead to ap proaches to therapy, as DCM alleles result in functional changes that are the ABSTRACTS SYMPOSIA ESHG 2014 | MILAN, ITALY | WWW.

However, in the majority of patients a molecular mechanism linking rearranged chromosomes to disease pheno type is lacking. This is particularly true for ultra complex genomic rearran gements, such as those resulting from catastrophic chromosome shattering termed chromothripsis. We developed a family based approach for dissec ting the functional consequences of (complex) genomic rearrangements in patients with congenital disease. This approach combines gene expression and chromatin profiling with functional studies in patient derived cell lines and model organisms. We highlight two cases where family based analysis and functional follow up studies were instrumental to reveal the drivers of the disease phenotype. The described methodology is key for understan ding disease in a large and broad category of patients with chromosomal aberrations of unclassified significance and thereby improves diagnosis and clinical decision making.",2014
20745,"Cancer is the ultimate disorder of the genome, characterised by not one or two substitutions, indels or copy number aberrations, but hundreds to thou sands of acquired mutations that have been accrued through the develop ment of a tumour. The set of mutations observed in a cancer genome is not simply a random accumulation of variants. It is the aggregate outcome of se veral biological mutational processes comprising an underlying mechanism of DNA damage mitigated by the DNA repair pathways that exist in human cells. Each mutational process will leave its distinctive mark or mutational signature on the cancer genome. Recently, we set out to extract the mutational signatures characterizing the mutational processes that have been operative in 21 whole genome sequenced breast cancers. Multiple distinct known and novel substitution, insertion/deletion and rearrangement signatures were unearthed by these analyses. Here, I will describe one particularly intriguing signature of locali zed regions of dense somatic hypermutation, called kataegis, in which sub stitutions at C:G base pairs occurring within a distinctive sequence context were found associated with clusters of genomic rearrangements. Using an algorithm developed to allow efficient detection of kataegis, we investigate other whole genome sequenced cancers to show that this phenomenon is not restricted to breast cancer. These studies harness the full scale of who le genome sequencing. Furthermore, detailed and considered analyses of genomic data can provide biological insights that would otherwise remain buried. The mechanism of kataegis however, is unknown. On the basis of similarities in mutation class and sequence context in experimental systems, members of the AID/APOBEC family of cytidine deaminases were implicated.

20749,"Shortness of stature is one of the most common pediatric concerns and has an incidence of 3 % in the general population. In the majority of patients with idiopathic growth deficit the etiology remains elusive in the absence of morphological details. This unknown etiology prevents a sufficient medical care in most cases. As it has been proposed that the growth fundamentally regulated by gene tic factors, GWAS found significant evidence for both single nucleotide and copy number polymorphisms associated with height variation in the general population. However, these associations explain only a small fraction of the overall variability of human height.

ORG 11Back to inde x of idiopathic and syndromic (Leri Weil syndrome) short stature as well as copy number variation (CNV) as a common cause of intellectual disability, the hypothesis of a Ã¢ÂÂrare variant frequent diseaseÃ¢ÂÂ hypothesis seemed to be feasible for short stature. To address this hypothesis we thoroughly build a study group of more than 400 families with idiopathic short stature and con ducted SNP array analysis to demonstrate the presence of CNVs as a common underlying cause of short stature. Molecular karyotyping was performed and CNVs of a minimum size of 50kb scored and compared to healthy controls. Based on this technique we found a significant odds ratio for aberrations above 100 kb only. Due to the number of potential disease causing CNVs a gene centric analysis comparing known CNVs, gene functions, tissue expres sion and murine knock out phenotypes was neccessary. We confirmed that 10 % of the patients had de novo and inherited CNVs in agreement to the segregation of the short stature phenotype in the families. These CNV regions include known microdeletion/duplication loci expanding the phenotypical spectrum of these entities. The pathogenicity of novel loci was substantiated by comparison to available information, especially the overlap with loci of genome wide association for short stature. Our data showed a clear connec tion between the prenatal onset of short stature as well as the severity of the growth deficit with the likelihood of the identification of causal CNVs. Thus, we confirmed CNVs as a main cause of idiopathic short stature. Further improvement of the array technology as well as the application of CNV iden tification based on next generation sequencing will lead to a more elaborate and detailed view on even smaller CNVs. Application of these methods can help to illuminate the complex heterogeneity of short stature.",2014
20750,"Although epigenetic changes in the cancer genome have been known for 3 decades, the role of epigenetics in common human disease generally and its relationship to genetic variation has only recently begun to be explored. We have been developing whole genome approaches to epigenetic analysis of human disease. Surprising results have been the discovery of CpG island shores and large hypomethylated blocks corresponding to nuclear lamina / heterochromatin lysine modification regions (LOCKs), and accounting for the vast majority of epigenetic changes in cancer. We have also been contri buting to a new field of epigenetic epidemiology that integrates genetic, epi genetic, and environmental factors, and we are applying these approaches to the study of autoimmune and neuropsychiatric disease. One of the most exciting developments in this recent work is the idea that epigenetic plasti city under genetic control may itself confer a survival advantage in evoluti on, and may also be important in normal tissue differentiation and response to the environment. In support of this idea, we have identified variably me thylated regions (VMRs) in normal development. These same VMRs appear to be targets for disrupted methylation in cancer, pointing to a unifying mo del of cancer in which epigenetic dysregulation allows rapid selection for tumor cell survival at the expense of the host. We have also identified gene tic variants that increase epigenetic plasticity in patients with autoimmune disease.

20752,"Traditionally definitive prenatal diagnosis of genetic and chromosomal disorders has required analysis of fetal tissue obtained by invasive testing (usually chorionic villus sampling or amniocentesis) which carries a small but significant risk of miscarriage. The identification of cell free fetal DNA (cffDNA) in maternal plasma from four weeks gestation offered an alterna tive source of fetal genetic material for testing based on a simple maternal blood sample, thereby allowing earlier and safer prenatal diagnosis. The majority of cell free DNA in maternal plasma emanates from the mother herself. This high background of maternal cfDNA meant that early applica tions were based on the detection of exclusion of alleles that were inherited from the father, e.g. SRY, or that arose de novo, e.g. achondondroplasia. Fe tal sex determination based on analysis of cfDNA is now widely available in Europe in pregnancies at risk of sex linked disorders, where it is used to di rect invasive testing. It is also available clinically in the UK for the definitive diagnosis of a number of conditions including some skeletal dypslasias and Apert syndrome, as well as for the exclusion of the paternal allele in families at risk of cystic fibrosis where parents carry different mutations. Elsewhere in Europe it has been used for the non invasive diagnosis of other conditions such as Huntingdon Disease, but invasive testing has been required to con firm the fetal mutation status. The other major application is fetal Rhesus D typing in RhD negative mothers where it is used both to inform pregnancy management in women with a history of haemolytic disease of the newborn, as well as to direct routine immunoprophylaxis with anti D immunoglobulin to those RhD negative mothers carrying an RhD positive baby. With the advent of next generation sequencing (NGS) it has become possible to estimate the proportion of sequence aligning to different chromosomes present in maternal blood and thereby detect fetal aneuploidy. This is now widely available in the private sector with detection rates for trisomies 13, 18 and 21 in excess of 99% with similarly high specificities. However dis cordant results are regularly reported and this test can only be considered a highly predictive screening test with invasive testing required to confirm positive results. The potential for easy access to non invasive prenatal diagnosis and testing has raised significant ethical concerns, largely with regard to maintaining informed parental choice, and the need for good health professional and public education. The huge commercial drive to implement NIPT for an euploidy serves to heighten the need for early introduction of educational programmes and careful consideration of strategies required to facilitate appropriate implementation into public health services.",2014
20753,"Noninvasive prenatal testing (NIPT) for Down syndrome (DS) using massively parallel sequencing of maternal plasma DNA facilitates early detection of affec ted fetuses.

Our laboratory is using a 4 phase trans lational approach that involves human biomaterials (amniocytes and amniotic fluid), a mouse model of DS, and living human fetuses. In phase 1 we compared the transcriptome of fetuses with and without DS by analysis of cell free RNA in amniotic fluid and showed that oxidative stress was a significant difference in the affected fetuses. In phase 2 we uploaded differentially regulated genes into the Connectivity Map to identify candidate FDA approved therapeutic molecules. In phase 3 drugs that had high efficacy in negating oxidative stress and showed low toxicity were selected for further studies in an animal model.

20758,"The biochemical study of the components and associated molecular net works of the auditory sensory cells, the hair cells, are strongly impeded by the small number of these cells. In contrast, human and mouse genetic ap proaches have proven to be powerful to identify such components. The presentation will focus on the hair bundle of the hair cells that operates the mechano electrical transduction (MET). This sensory antenna is com prised of several rows of rigid microvilli, known as stereocilia of a few fem toliters in volume, that are organised in a staircase pattern. The MET process relies not only on the MET machinery but also on the proper architectural and biophysical properties of the hair bundle. In addition, any defect that affects the mechanical elements involved in sound induced oscillation of the hair bundle or its ionic environment necessary to drive hair cell depolariza tion, also perturbs MET . For each of these contributors to the MET , several key components have been identified by studying inherited deafness forms; they are used as entry points to decipher the involved molecular networks. The presentation will illustrate how the genetic approach led to the discove ry of molecules controlling the development, maturation and maintenance of the correct structure of the hair bundle and the MET process. It will illu strate how it enlightens our understanding of the way these proteins form molecular complexes in vivo and how these complexes work and cooperate together.

20759,"Fanconi anemia (FA) is a rare genetic disease characterized by bone mar row failure, malformations, chromosome fragility, hypersensitivity to DNA interstrand cross linking (ICL) chemotherapy and a high predisposition to cancer, including leukemia and solid tumors such as head and neck and gynecological carcinomas. The only cure of the hematological disease, which is the major cause of early death, is bone marrow transplantation using an HLA compatible donor. Those families with unavailable donor rely on pre implantation genetic diagnosis with selection of an HLA related embryo and in the future implementation of advanced gene and cell therapies. All these novel therapeutic applications to human health are further complicated by the fact that at least 16 genes, from FANCA to FANCQ, are involved in this disease and their products interact in a complex genome stability and tu mor suppression network. Notably, 4 out of 16 FA genes (FANCD1/BRCA2, FANCN/PALB2, FANCJ/BRIP1 and FANCO/Rad51C) are breast cancer sus ceptibility genes in otherwise unaffected mutation carriers. Therefore, the discovery of novel Fanconi anemia genes is important not only for the affec ted patients but also for the general population.

20761,"Only about 1% of the genome encodes for the ~20000 human proteins, which are similar in number and largely orthologous to those found in orga nisms of significant lower complexity. On the contrary, the proportion of non protein coding DNA has increased with developmental complexity reaching 98.5% in humans. Interestingly, up to two thirds of the human genome is composed of non protein coding repetitive sequences. Furthermore, a signi ficant portion of the epigenetic modifications is present in these regions and DNA repeats are dynamically transcribed in different cells and developmen tal stages producing a vast pool of non protein coding RNA (ncRNA) molecu les. Thus, ncRNAs produced by DNA repeats may hold the key to understan ding the regulatory complexity inherent in advanced biological networks. Long ncRNAs (lncRNAs) represent the most numerous and functionally di verse class of RNA produced by mammalian cells. Despite the growing inte rest on lncRNAs, they still remain poorly explored in terms of biological re levance, cellular function, mechanism of action and involvement in disease. We have recently contributed to this field through the identification of the first activating lncRNA involved in a human genetic disease: facioscapulohu meral muscular dystrophy (FSHD). FSHD is one of the most important genetic diseases affecting the skele tal muscle. It is an autosomal dominant disorder with a strong epigenetic component. Unlike the majority of genetic diseases, FSHD is not caused by mutation in a protein coding gene. Instead, the disease is associated with a reduced copy number of the D4Z4 macrosatellite repeat mapping to 4q35. Despite years of intensive research, the molecular pathogenesis of FSHD remains largely unknown. We recently identified DBE T , a chromatin asso ciated lncRNA produced preferentially in FSHD patients. DBE T mediates a Polycomb to Trithorax epigenetic switch at the FSHD locus, driving chroma tin remodeling and transcription of FSHD candidate genes. Here, I will discuss our recent results regarding the regulation of DBE T ex pression, the mechanism responsible for DBE T tethering to chromatin and how this lncRNA regulates the epigenetic status of the FSHD locus.",2014

Accurate formation of RNPs in vivo is fundamentally important to cellular development and function, and its im pairment often leads to human disease.

20764,"Cancers arise and progress due to the underlying Darwinian somatic evo lution. It has been commonly accepted that biological and clinical behavi ors of individual tumors reflect properties of the most abundant cells that have achieved clonal dominance by virtue of carrying the most Ã¢ÂÂadvancedÃ¢ÂÂ complement of oncogenic driver mutations. However, the recent influx of data from tumor genome sequencing has revealed a remarkable degree of genetic divergence within tumors, including sub clonal differences in mu tational status of key driver genes. This clonal heterogeneity begs obvious questions: i) what are the mechanisms that enable co existence of geneti cally distinct populations, and ii) what are the biological consequences of this co existence? Microenvironmentally constrained tumors represent a particularly interesting scenario: overcoming the bottleneck requires chan ges in the tumor environment induced by secreted factors, but it is not clear a priori whether the expression of a secreted factor capable of driving tumor outgrowth can provide an autonomous fitness advantage. To address this scenario, we have developed a mouse xenograft model of microenvironmen tally constrained tumors. Using this model, we have interrogated the impact of sub clonal expression of secreted factors in contexts of either competition against the parental clone or that of polyclonal tumors. We found that tumor progression can be driven non cell autonomously by a sub population of cells that is unable to achieve clonal dominance. This non cell autonomous driving of tumor growth is predicted to stabilize sub clonal heterogeneity within tumors throughout clinically relevant time frames. This co existence of biologically distinct sub populations enables inter clonal interactions that can affect clinically important phenotype",2014
20765,"Sensitive methods have been developed to capture circulating tumor cells (CTCs) in the peripheral blood at the single cell level (Pantel et al., Nat Rev Cancer 2008). CTCs are usually detected by immunostaining or RT PCR as says, and more recently by the EPISPOT assay which measures the number of cells releasing/secreting tumor associated marker proteins. Interestingly, detection of cell free nucleic acids released by tumor cells into the blood might become an indirect way to detect micrometastatic disease (Schwar zenbach et al, Nat Rev Cancer 2011). At present, most CTC assays rely on epithelial markers and miss CTCs undergoing an epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT). New markers such as the actin bundling protein plastin 3 (Yokobori et al., Cancer Res. 2013) are not downregulated during EMT and not expressed in normal blood cells might overcome this important limita tion and, therefore, increase the sensitivity of CTC assays. Recently, in vivo capture of CTCs with an antibody coated wire placed into the peripheral arm vein has become feasible and allows now the Ã¢ÂÂfishingÃ¢ÂÂ for CTCs from approx. 1.5 liters of blood within 30 minutes. CTC enumeration and charac terization with certified systems provides reliable information on prognosis and may serve as liquid biopsy (Alix Panabieres & Pantel, Clin. Chem. 2013; Pantel & Alix Panabieres, Cancer Res., 2013). Interestingly, the subset of Ep CAM low, CD44high, CD47+, c Met+ CTCs obtained from the peripheral blood of breast cancer patients might represent metastasis initiator cells (Baccelli et al, Nature Biotech. 2013). Moreover, monitoring of CTCs before, during and after systemic therapy (e.g., chemotherapy, hormonal therapy, antibody the rapy) might provide unique information for the future clinical management of the individual cancer patient. This information can be used as companion diagnostics to improve the stratification of therapies and to obtain insights into therapy induced selection of cancer cells.

20766,"Thankfully, DNA and protein sequencing technologies revolutionized gene tics and proteomics. Sadly, the two other macromolecules, carbohydrates and lipids, missed that technical revolution creating a malady called Glyco lipophobia. Perhaps its development was predictable based on their mole cular complexity, template independent biosynthesis, and structural analy sis without having defined functions. Fortunately, this condition is treatable, and given the discovery of over 100 genetic disorders in these pathways, treatment should not be delayed. Glycosylation related genes comprise 1 2% of the human genome and those genes often fall into a series of distinct (sometimes overlapping) pa thways. Each pathway generates sugar chains (glycans) for typical Ã¢ÂÂclientsÃ¢ÂÂ. The best known pathway is N glycosylation found in secreted proteins, membrane bound receptors, and signaling molecules. Some glycosylation disorders involve addition of glycans to lipids, not proteins. A few glycoli pids are biosynthetic precursors of other pathways, but two define distinct pathways: glycosylphosphatidylinolsitol (GPI) anchors and glycosphingoli pids (GSL). These molecules are often located in lipid rafts. Fifteen distinct disorders disrupt these pathways. All cells contain GPI and GSL, and affected patients display a range of mostly severe phenotypes that can include intel lectual disability, seizures, ophthalmologic abnormalities, heart defects, and often plasma hyper or hypo phosphatasia. Simple biochemical indicators can help identify likely candidate genes from exome sequencing, and then also confirm those candidates. Cellular assays based on the established pa thways can help design potential therapeutic screens. Understanding the biosynthetic pathways not only suggests, and then con firms, candidate genes, but it creates avenues for therapy, based on the re storation of functional readouts. The powerful partnership of biochemistry and genetics can help eradicate or reduce Glyco lipophobia.

20771,"Inherited thrombocytopenias (ITs) are a heterogeneous group of rare di seases characterized by bleeding risk sometimes associated with platelet dysfunction or other clinical features. More than twenty different forms have been characterized (Table 1). They account for almost 50% of the IT patients, suggesting that many forms are still unrecognizable. The IT genes play a variety of roles in the complex process of megaka ryopoisis and platelet production though their function is often unclear. In the rare forms of CAMT , CTRUS and TAR, thrombocytopenia is severe be cause of absence or reduction of megakaryocytes (MKs). Whereas in TAR, the platelet count tends to rise during life, in CAMT and CTRUS the disease progresses to bone marrow failure. Loss of function of MPL, the receptor of thrombopoietin, prevents production of Mks in the bone marrow of the CAMT patients. Less certain is instead the role of HOXA11 and RBM8A in CTRUS and TAR, respectively. In another group of ITs there is a defect of MK maturation. In two of these forms, ANKRD26RD and PFD/AML, patients are also at risk of developing leukemias. Whereas the role of ANKRD26 remains obscure, RUNX1 is a ma ster transcription factor regulating hematopoiesis. RUNX1 binds several other modulators, including FLI1, whose haploinsufficiency due to 11q23 ter deletions determines TCPT or JBS. In case of mutations of GATA1 or GFI1B, another two hematopoietic transcription factors, thrombocytopenia associates with red cells defects and reduction of alpha granules. Absence of alpha granules resulting typical gray appearance of platelets is a patho gnomic feature of GPS. NBEAL2, the causative gene in this form, is likely to function in vesicle trafficking and generation of platelet granules. The largest group of ITs could be related to defects of proplatelet formation, a process involving dynamic reorganization of the cytoskeleton, signaling pathways or apoptosis. Regarding the first aspect, mutations in genes en coding for components of the cytoskeleton (MYH9, ACTN1, TUBB1, WAS or FLNA) are likely to interfere with the correct proplatelet extension and pla telet release. Of note, FLNA interacts with the C terminus of GPIbalpha, one subunits of the von Willebrand factor receptor (GPIb/IX/V). Alterations of GPIb/IX/V cause BSS characterized by mild thrombocytopenia associated with reduction of platelet aggregation. Finally, defects of cytochrome c (CYCS) could be associated with increased apoptosis and premature release of platelets into bone marrow instead of blood stream. This heterogeneity makes the molecular diagnostic testing a complex and time consuming process. Next generation sequencing strategies will have a strong impact in the diagnosis of the known forms and cloning novel IT genes. Table 1.

20772,"Until the end of the last century, a few forms of inherited thrombocytope nia (IT) were known and these disorders were considered exceedingly rare. Spontaneous bleeding was considered as a feature common to all patients and as the main clinical consequence of these disorders. Recently, many new forms of ITs have been identified and our view of these disorders has consi derably changed. We realized that ITs are less rare than previously thought and that most patients have mild or no spontaneous bleedings. In many cases thrombocytopenia is discovered incidentally during adult life and its genetic origin is missed, exposing patients to the risk of misdiagnosis with immune thrombocytopenia. To avoid this mistake, it is therefore essential that ITs are considered in the differential diagnosis of any thrombocytope nia of unknown origin both in children and adults. Family history, to search for other affected family members, and physical examination, to identify the defects that typically associate with thrombocytopenia in syndromic forms, are useful tools in this respect, although negative results do not exclude the genetic origin of platelet deficiency. Microscope evaluation of blood films is another key element for differential diagnosis, as morphological anomalies of platelets (increased or reduced size, defects of granules or vacuolization), leukocytes (DÃÂ¶hle like bodies in neutrophils) or red cells (anisocytosis) are observable in many ITs. Once an IT is suspected, a diagnostic algorithm can guide further investi gation toward the specific patientÃ¢ÂÂs disease. It is likely that next generation sequencing techniques will simplify this process in the near future. A definite diagnosis is essential for proper patient management. In some forms of IT , the major risk for affected subjects does not derive from blee dings, but from the increased propensity to develop additional disorders, as hematological malignancies or kidney failure. In syndromic ITs, associated extra hematological defects often have a much higher impact on patientsÃ¢ÂÂ quality of life than the reduced platelet count. The identification of geno type phenotype correlations for same disorders made feasible to identify and quantify the risks affecting each patient and to design personalized follow up protocols. A definite diagnosis is also required to personalize treatment, as platelet transfusions are no longer the only remedy for ITs (Table 1).Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation can cure ITs and this treatment is the best option for a few disorders that invariably lead to death during child hood. The thrombopoietin mimetic eltrombopag is effective in increasing platelet count in the IT induced by MYH9 mutations, the most frequent form of IT , and this drug has been successfully used instead of platelet transfu sions to prepare patients for elective surgery. Splenectomy has no role in ITs, except for patients with WAS mutations, whose platelet counts increase after spleen removal. Finally, effective treatments are available also for some extra hematological defects of syndromic ITs. Table 1.

Ripatti1,2,3; 1Hjelt Institute, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland, 2Institute for Molecular Medicine Finland (FIMM), Helsinki, Finland, 3Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, Hinxton, United Kingdom. Genome wide association (GWA) studies have provided hints and pointers towards causes of many common complex diseases and the current wave of large scale sequencing efforts is likely to refine many of these signals. Using cardiovascular diseases (CVD) as an example, I will describe efforts to turn the association results into risk evaluations and efforts towards developing tools to help in preventive medicine. Almost two thirds of the incident CVD cases are not identified as high risk individuals using the currently widely used risk scores, such as the Framing ham risk score. Almost 50 genetic loci have been indentified for coronary artery disease and even though the effect sizes of individual common vari ants identified by GWA studies are small, the large number of loci provide an opportunity to use the SNPs jointly in genetic risk scores (GRS). These scores have comparable risk profiles with quantitative risk factors like blood pressure or LDL cholesterol and have a potential to identify high risk individuals missed by the traditional risk factor screens. Using results from prospective cohorts, I show how the genetic risk scores provide complementary information for prediction over the traditional risk factors and show how GRS help in identifying individuals with high risk. I discuss the potential benefits of targeted interventions using both tradi tional risk factor and genetic risk score information and show how already using the currently known risk loci provide an opportunity to prevent disea se events. Finally, I discuss the need for developing tools to communicate the genetic risk to medical community and citizens, and the need to test the risk scores in clinical settings.",2014

Even the genomic DNA sequence may vary slightly between neighboring normal cells within a tissue albeit the differences are can be significant in adjacent tumor cells. In order to get information from single cells one need to isolate, study, and sometimes culture them, separately.

20776,"Next generation sequencing has revolutionized the search for disease cau sing genetic alterations. Unfortunately, the task of distinguishing the hand ful of causative mutations from the multitude of harmless polymorphisms remains daunting. We have developed a system that permits the study of all types of mutations in any gene of choice. The system is based on the gene ration of stable human cell lines that simultaneously and inducibly express a cDNA encoding the protein carrying the mutation of interest and shRNA against the endogenous mRNA. In this way, the endogenous wild type pro tein can be replaced with a variant expressing any mutation and, if desired, also a tag for affinity purification or visualization. In this presentation, I shall focus on polymerase delta and MLH1, which have been found to be mutated in familiar and sporadic colon cancers.",2014
20777,"of Genetics, Erasmus MC, Rotterdam, Netherlands. Inherited defects in nucleotide excision repair (NER) removing helix distor ting DNA lesions are associated with cancer predisposition in xeroderma pigmentosum and neurodevelopmental deficits and segmental progeria in Cockayne syndrome and trichothiodystrophy (TTD). Mutations in single NER genes, such as XPD, are linked with all three disorders. Various sin gle and double NER mouse mutants reveal that the severity of specific re pair defects strictly correlates with the acceleration of selective premature aging features, whereas the type of DNA repair defect determines the kind of progeroid symptoms and/or cancer susceptibility. Microarray, functional and physiological studies revealed that persistent DNA damage, like caloric restriction, down regulates the IGF1/GH , lacto and thyrotropic hormonal axes and upregulates anti oxidant defenses, favoring maintenance at the expense of growth. This Ã¢ÂÂsurvival responseÃ¢ÂÂ links accumulation of DNA da mage and IGF1 control of life span. Micro and mRNA expression profiling of normal, accelerated and delayed aging also revealed a clear parallel with the expression changes triggered by persistent transcription blocking DNA le sions. These findings strongly support the DNA damage theory of aging. We will present phenotypes of conditional DNA repair models targeting aging to selected organs, parallels with AlzheimerÃ¢ÂÂs disease and the effect of nutritio nal interventions on the life span of progeroid repair mutants.",2014
20778,"Mosaicism refers to the presence of two or more populations of cells with different genotypes within an organism, The timing of the events that lead to various mosaic genomic alterations can vary widely, leading to many diffe rent patterns of mosaicism. Mosaicism can result from abnormalities arising during meiosis, with correction during earliest development in some cells, or it may arise postzygotically, during early mitotic divisions. Mosaicism has been detected at surprisingly high frequency in the very early embryo, in miscarriages, in a wide variety of patients with clinical abnormalities and in normal individuals. In some cases, the clinical presentation might suggest mosaicism, as for example, in cases of ambiguous sex in an individual with XX/XY mosaicism, or in individuals with patchy pigmentation where lighter and darker skin may have different genotypes. However, in many cases mo saicism cannot be discerned at the clinical level. Mosaicism can be restricted to somatic tissues only, in which case it is unlikely to be inherited, or it can occur in both somatic and germline tissues, where transmission is possible, and in some cases it may be present in germ cells only, so that a normal individual is at risk for having multiple offspring with the mosaic finding. Mosaicism can be restricted to a single tissue, such as the brain or heart, causing tissue limited pathology, such as autism, schizophrenia or cardiac disease. In this session, we will trace the history of mosaicism from earliest examples of chromosomal mosaicism through recognition of mosaic DNA alterations and we will demonstrate how the utilization of SNP based chro mosomal microarray analysis and next generation sequencing have vastly improved our ability to detect mosaicism, leading to markedly increased recognition of the role of mosaicism in human disease. We will discuss the clinical and molecular classes of mosaicism, their detection and the biologi cal insights gained from these studies.",2014
20779,"Revertant mosaicism (RM) refers to the co existence of cells carrying disea se causing mutations with cells in which the inherited mutation is geneti cally corrected by a spontaneous post zygotic event. RM in skin was first reported by us in 1997 in the genetic disorder epidermolysis bullosa (EB), which is characterized by lifelong fragile skin that easily forms blisters and erosions. In a patient with generalized atrophic benign EB, caused by com pound heterozygosity at the COL17A1 locus, we found several patchy areas of healthy skin and provided molecular proof that the keratinocytes in the clinically unaffected skin were corrected by a gene conversion event, and consequently produced normal type XVII collagen. Mutations in as many as 18 genes can result in EB. Five of these genes have shown to revert: KRT14 encoding keratin 14 in EB simplex, LAMB3 encoding the ÃÂ²3 chain of laminin 332, and COL17A1 encoding type XVII collagen in junctional EB, COL7A1 en coding type VII collagen in dystrophic EB, and FERMT1 encoding kindlin 1 in Kindler syndrome. RM was also found in other heritable skin diseases: dyskeratosis congenita, and in ichthyosis in confetti (ichthyosis variegata) induced by increased homologous recombination of KRT10. Similar examp les of Ã¢ÂÂnatural gene therapyÃ¢ÂÂ by RM have been described in Bloom syndro me, leukocyte adherence deficiency type 1, Wiskott Aldrich syndrome, and RAG1 deficient severe combined immunodeficiency. This Ã¢ÂÂnatural gene the rapyÃ¢ÂÂ phenomenon manifests as normal appearing skin areas surrounded by affected skin. Although initially thought to be rare, RM is now considered relatively common in genetic skin diseases. To address the issues relevant to RM, we will discuss the following questions: 1) What is the incidence of RM in heritable skin diseases? 2) What are the repair mechanisms in RM? 3) When do the revertant mutations occur? 4) How do you recognize revertant skin? 5) Do the areas of RM change in size? The answers to these questi ons allow us to acquire knowledge on these reverted cells, the mechanisms of RM, and utility of the reverted cells to the advantage of the patient. The revertant skin could potentially be used to treat the patientÃ¢ÂÂs own affected skin. Revertant skin cells can be used for transplantation by means of: 1) own skin biopsies, 2) cell suspension, 3) cultured epithelial cell sheet, 4) in duced pluripotent stem cells reprogrammed as epithelial sheet for skin graf ting or as haemopoietic stem cells for infusion. Transplantation of revertant skin biopsies has already succesfully been performed in a patient with EB.",2014
20780,"Assigning medically relevant roles to human genes is at the core of medical genetics as a field. In the area of Mendelian genetics, such assignment should be relatively straightforward since the phenotypic effect of Mendelian genes is usually large and measurable. The recent ability to interrogate the entire genome (or its coding portion) has provided an unprecedented opportunity to rapidly discover disease causing genes by circumventing historical road blocks that characterized previous approaches. However, even this cutting edge tool has its own set of challenges. In this session, the two presenters will share with the audience the lessons they learned from their ongoing effort to unravel the Ã¢ÂÂMendeliomeÃ¢ÂÂ, one gene at a time. They draw from their combined experience not only in the successful identification of >120 Men delian genes, but also, and as importantly, from the many unexpected results they encountered in their research programs. The first presenter will provi de an overview of the recent successes and pace of novel gene discovery and discuss the implementation of next generation sequencing tools alone, or in combination with autozygosity positional mapping, to identify autosomal recessive Mendelian genes. The second presenter will continue the same theme by sharing experience with autosomal dominant disorders and their own set of associated challenges. Both presenters will discuss in detail the pitfalls of the various approaches and suggest some helpful strategies. The immediate and critical need to exchange information about rare variants in genes, which is likely to grow in even more importance as we start to iden tify genes that contribute a decreasing percentage to the overall Mendelian mutation burden, will be emphasized by both presenters. At the end of the session, it is hoped that interested investigators will have acquired basic knowledge on optimal designs of projects aimed to discover novel disease genes.

20782,"Cystic Fibrosis (CF) is a common genetic disease caused by mutations in the Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator ( CFTR ) gene that lead to reduction of CFTR anion channel function on the surface of fluid trans porting epithelial tissues. The clinical phenotype is variable but severely affected individuals typically suffer from airway obstruction with recurrent episodes of inflammation and infection as well as pancreatic insufficiency. The need to overcome this gap in knowledge is urgent, particularly given the recent success in developing drugs that target the basic defects caused by CFTR mutation. VX 770 (or Ivacaftor) has been approved as a drug for patients bearing the relatively rare mutation: p. Gly551Asp mutation. The most common mutation, p. Phe508del, has been studied extensively and found to impair CFTR protein folding during synthesis. Knowledge regar ding the molecular defects caused by p. Phe508del has driven development of targeted, interventional compounds, such as VX 809. The development of these drugs highlights the therapeutic relevance of understanding the basic defects caused by CFTR mutation. Approximately 2000 different variants in the CFTR gene have been reported in the CF Mutation Database, yet, the molecular consequences of less than 10% of these variants are understood. In this presentation, our interrogation of a rare variant, c.3700 A>G, will be discussed. This mutation leads to aberrant splicing and the in frame deleti on of six amino acids (p. Ile1234_Arg1239del) in a conserved region of the CFTR protein. The deletion of these residues, caused protein misfolding as in the case of p. Phe508del. These insights led us to test the efficacy of an inve stigational compound in trials for p. Phe508del and found that, in cell cultu re, VX 809 partially ameliorated the folding defect of p. Ile1234_Arg1239del CFTR. Hence, these studies support the rationale for defining the molecular consequences of rare CFTR mutations in guiding decisions regarding future drug discovery efforts.",2014
20783,"The 1998 IVD Directive regulates the market for diagnostic tests within the EU, setting out standards for the design and manufacture of in vitro dia gnostic devices (IVDs) and providing mechanisms for the oversight of these standards. The current system is inflexible, unresponsive and does not do a good job of protecting patients from harm. In September 2012, the Euro pean Commission launched a proposal for a complete overhaul of the IVD regulations. While welcoming these proposals as a move towards a flexible, transparent and proportionate system which would bring the EU closer to international best practice, EuroGentest and ESHG have also expressed con cerns about a number of provisions which do not provide effective regulati on of the burgeoning commercial market for genomic diagnostics, including direct to consumer genetic testing. We have made detailed submissions to the Commission, to MEPs and to regulatory bodies to improve the proposed regulation in these areas. Tests manufactured and used within health insti tution labs are exempt from the current IVD Directive the so called Ã¢ÂÂhealth institution exemptionÃ¢ÂÂ.

20785,"The presence of cell free fetal DNA in the maternal circulation has allowed for the development of methods for non invasive detection of fetal chro mosomal aneuploidies. Non invasive prenatal testing (NIPT) thus avoids miscarriages due to invasive sampling of fetal material. We developed an innovative, fast, cost efficient workflow and high throughput analysis pipe line. For validation, cell free DNA of 297 maternal blood samples were coll ected from women between 9 15 weeks of gestational age who were also undergoing invasive sampling for increased risk of fetal aneuploidy. Whole genome sequencing was performed on cell free DNA sequencing libraries on a HiSeq2500 using the fast mode 50bp single ends. In addition to the Z scores, traditionally the main measure for non invasive aneuploidy detec tion, we defined different new parameters which allow for a higher accura cy aneuploidy detection. Moreover, the use of Z scores across sliding bins enables the distinction to be made between maternal and fetal CNVs. This approach resulted in 100% specificity and sensitivity for trisomy 21 and 18 detection (trisomy 21, n,17; trisomy 18, n,7).

20787,"Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) mutations cause serious disorders maternally inherited with high transmission risk, resulting in requests for preimplan tation or prenatal diagnoses. These procedures are hampered by our poor knowledge on the pathophysiology of mtDNA mutations during human de velopment. Specifically, how mtDNA mutations impact the mtDNA content? We collected oocytes, embryos, placentas and fetal tissues at various stages of development, from controls and carriers of m.3243A>G (MTTL1, MELAS), m.8344A>G (MTTK, MERRF) and m.8993T>G (MTATP6, NARP). We devised a test assessing simultaneously mtDNA copy number (CN) and mutant load in single cells. MtDNA CN increased from the germinal vesicle to the blastocyst stage in m.3243A>G cells, suggestive of a mutation dependent induction of mtDNA replication, that may compensate for the respiratory chain dysfunction. Analyses of placentas showed that mtDNA CN significantly increased in m.3243A>G at 11 GW, becoming identical to controls at delivery, probably owing to a placental energy demand maximal at the end of the 1 st trimester. Analyses of fetal tissues showed that mtDNA CN was similar in m.3243A>G vs control tissues apart from the lung; lower in m.8993T>G muscle, heart, and liver vs control. Mutant loads were identical in all tissues from a given fetus, indicating an absence of mutant load/mtDNA content correlation. These data highlight the complex relationships between mtDNA mutations and mtDNA content, depending on mutation types, mutant loads, cell types and development stages. Transcriptome and mtDNA replication studies should help us in unravelling the molecular bases of these observations, of particular relevance for therapeutic approaches in mtDNA disorders.",2014
20788,"Preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) is the genetic testing of embryos prior to implantation to avoid the transmission of germline genetic disor ders or of unbalanced chromosomal rearrangements when a parent is a balanced carrier.

Array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) based methods, which are mainly applied for preim plantation genetic screening (PGS) to discern diploid from aneuploid em bryos, enable genome wide aneuploidy detection but do not allow diagno sing single gene disorders. Here, we present a generic method that detects in single blastomeres not only the presence of Mendelian disorders genome wide, but also chromosomal rearrangements and aneuploidies, including their parental origin as well as the meiotic or mitotic nature of chromoso mal trisomies. The method interrogates single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and uses a novel computational pipeline for single cell genome wide haplotyping and imputation of linked disease variants (siCHILD). Following stringent single cell QC metrics, a bimodal approach, based on discrete SNP calls and continuous SNP B allele fractions, respectively, reconstructs the parental haplotypes of the biopsied single cell. The approach proved ac curate on 55 embryos from 12 couples carrying either autosomal dominant, recessive or X linked Mendelian disorders, or simple or complex transloca tions. The method allowed diagnosing an embryo for multiple monogenic disorders at once, and, in contrast to current PGD for translocation cases, it enabled distinguishing embryos that inherited normal chromosomes from embryos that inherited a balanced configuration of the rearranged derivati ve chromosomes.

The implementation of non invasive prenatal testing (NIPT) of Down syn drome (DS) in national health care systems requires decision making about the possible restriction of NIPT to high risk pregnancies, the timing of NIPT , and the combination with other tests. In this study, we combined ethical ex ploration with a decision analytic model. We compared three implementa tion strategies: (1) restriction of NIPT to high risk pregnancies on the basis of the combined test (CT) (risk for DS Ã¢ÂÂ¥ 1:200); (2) NIPT for all women at 13 weeks of gestation; (3) NIPT for all women at 10 weeks of gestation. Compa ring strategy 1 to strategy 2, 95% fewer women underwent NIPT , and false positive 1 st trimester screening results and invasive procedures were redu ced by 95% and 37%, respectively. This was at the expense of a decrease in DS detection of 11% before 15 weeks of gestation and 4% throughout the entire pregnancy (3 DS cases/100,000 pregnancies). Comparing strategy 2 to strategy 3, NIPT was avoided in an additional 4% of pregnancies that would have resulted in miscarriage. Furthermore, delaying NIPT to 13 weeks allows for immediate confirmation by amniocentesis, and may be beneficial to women who may feel overloaded with information in 1 st trimester. As NIPT currently does not detect all prenatal abnormalities, it should be offe red subsequent to or alongside a nuchal translucency (NT) measurement. In all cases of fetal anomaly on ultrasound (including NT enlargement), broad genetic testing after invasive procedure should still be performed.",2014
20790,"Non invasive prenatal testing (NIPT) for fetal abnormalities currently focu ses on DownÃ¢ÂÂs syndrome. It is to be expected, however, that it will become possible to broaden the scope of screening with NIPT . As proof of principle, it has been demonstrated that the complete fetal genome can be sequenced using fetal DNA from maternal plasma, potentially allowing prenatal whole genome analysis. This scenario makes a proactive ethical reflection of utmost importance. Normative issues to be addressed include the following: First, the prerequi site of proportionality. Do the possible benefits of whole genome sequen cing and analysis in prenatal screening outweigh the possible harms and disadvantages? Secondly, would it be possible to fulfill the requirement of informed consent, given the wide range of possible outcomes of whole genome prenatal screening? Could so called generic consent, based on pre test information about general categories of test outcomes, be accepted as a sound variant of informed consent ? And thirdly: if whole genome prenatal screening would result in the birth of children whose genotype has been elucidated prenatally, the childÃ¢ÂÂs right not to know may be violated, i.e. the right of the future, competent, person to decide about predictive testing for later onset diseases. How to handle, then, possible conflicts between future parentsÃ¢ÂÂ right to know and future childrenÃ¢ÂÂs right not to know? This presentation offers a systematic exploration of these issues, aimed at contributing to adequate ethical guidance for whole genome prenatal scree ning.",2014

Rs9828519, achieved genome wide significance (p,4.43x10^ 8), and its effect was re plicated in three independent cohorts of American, Italian and French pati ents (meta analyzed p,7.78x10^ 4). Rs9828519 is intronic of SLC9A9 gene, codifying for a sodium/hydrogen exchanger localised in the endosomes, not known to be involved in MS or in IFNÃÂ² pathways. With in vitro experiments, we observed an upregulation of SLC9A9 expression after IFNÃÂ² stimulation in PBMCs of 20 healthy controls (HC, p,4.01x10^ 7) which was unrelated to the genotype status. Such upregulation was confirmed also in IFNÃÂ² treated MS patients (GSE24427 and GSE26104 experiments: p,3.8x10^ 3 and 0.030). No cis effect of rs9828519 was observed in whole blood of MS patients, nor in PBMCs, CD14+ monocytes or CD4+ T lymphocytes collec ted from HC. For this reason we performed a trans eQTL analysis in 211 CD14+ monocytes isolated from HC followed by pathway analyses using three independent softwares. All of them enlighten an enrichment of IFNÃÂ² related pathways of genes trans regulated by rs9828519. We observed in the rs9828519GG samples an up regulation of genes involved in IFNÃÂ² si gnalling, including STAT1, JAK1, STAT5B, but also an impairment of the final effects of IFNÃÂ², with an upregulation of osteopontin and a downregulation of IL10.

20792,"Steroid resistant nephrotic syndrome (SRNS) is a disorder that results in end stage renal disease and can be potentially related to a genetic cause, es pecially when it occurs in children. However, because of genetic heterogenei ty, the real burden of genetic alterations in sporadic cases is unknown. In this study, we explored the possibility that genetic alterations of podocyteÃ¢ÂÂs structure may explain lack of response to steroid treatment in children af fected by sporadic childhood onset nephrotic syndrome (NS), not only in a causative manner, but also as critical disease modifiers that influence re sponse to steroid treatment and immunosuppressive agents. We designed a custom sequencing array to target all exons and part of flan king sequences for known podocyte genes responsible for SRNS, that was applied through next generation sequencing to a selected cohort of 50 pati ents with sporadic NS and variable response to steroid treatment. We identified a genetic cause in 40% of the 19 SRNS patients analysed. Mo difier genes were observed in an additional 25% of patients exhibiting re sistance to steroid, but nor disease causing neither disease modifier genes were observed in podocyteÃ¢ÂÂs genes of 30 additional children that were sen sitive to steroids. Treatment with immunosuppressive agents was effective only among patients that were negative to the test, while none of the pa tients displaying genetic alterations responded to any immunosuppressive agent. The results of this study suggest that in children affected by sporadic NS, re sistance to steroid treatment may be related to genetic alterations in genes that control structure and function of the podocyte.",2014

Thiopurine S methyltransferase (TPMT) pharmacogenetic testing can be used to optimize thiopurine safe ty and efficacy. Nonetheless, in clinical practice it is only used on a limited scale. We performed a randomized controlled trial including 769 IBD pa tients starting on thiopurine treatment. Patients were randomly assigned to standard treatment (control) or pre treatment screening (intervention) for three common TPMT variants (TPMT*2, *3A and *3C); patients hetero zygous for a TPMT variant received 50% of the standard thiopurine dose, and patients homozygous for the variants received 0 10%. Intervention and control groups were compared for leucopenia occurrence (leucocyte count <3.0*10 9/l) in the first 5 months after treatment initiation.

20794,"A typical human genome includes numerous apparent loss of function (LOF) variants, which may be attributed to sequencing or alignment errors, car rier states, hypomorphic alleles, gene redundancy, and true LOF alleles for haploinsufficiency sensitive genes. It is critical for understanding gene func tion and for predictive medicine to assess the consequences of LOF variants. Prior efforts to understand the genotype phenotype relationships were limi ted by ascertainment biases and the limitations of deidentified data. To ap proach this problem, we characterized the phenotypic consequences of LOF variation in an exome cohort of 950 individuals and iteratively validated the phenotypes. Exomes were generated by targeting and Illumina sequencing. Potential LOF variants were defined as nonsense, frameshift, and essential splice site variants. Analysis was restricted to HGMD genes. Variants with maf >0.005 in ClinSeq or dbSNP were excluded. We filtered for genes that cause disease in an autosomal dominant pattern by haploinsufficiency. Re maining variants were considered variants of interest, 87 were identified in 112 individuals. 85 of these individuals were evaluated for these disorders. We used stringent criteria for phenotyping and family history to identify va riants that were causing disease. Of the evaluated patients, half (38/85) had evidence of disease. The negative cases illustrated issues with gene model errors, mechanisms of alternative translation starts, etc. The positive cases demonstrate the ability to perform predictive medicine and to use filtering methods to identify inapparent genetic disorders. These data also point to approaches that could unravel the functional consequences of genes not yet known to cause human phenotypes.",2014

Genomic medicine is a clinical paradigm in which knowledge gained from analyzing an individualÃ¢ÂÂs genome is used to guide health care decisions throughout life, in order to anticipate, diagnose and manage disease. To pilot the implementation of genomic medicine in paediatrics we have developed the SickKids Genome Clinic, a multidisciplinary test bed that supports a wide range of research into the clinical uses of whole genome sequencing (WGS), from development of new bioinformatics pipelines and counselling models to health economics and bioethics studies. We are enrolling 150+ children/year who are undergoing diagnostic microarray analysis or multigene panel sequencing. Participants undergo WGS after their parents are counselled about WGS and have declared their preferences for learning their childÃ¢ÂÂs pharmacogenetic variants, adult onset incidental/secondary medically ac tionable variants (MAVs) and carrier status variants. Of the first 200 families approached, 117 agreed to participate, with ~75% of participants electing to learn about all available adult onset secondary MAVs and carrier variants. Of the parents who decide to learn of their childÃ¢ÂÂs adult onset secondary MAVs, approximately 60% also choose to learn if they carry the same variants. The most frequent concerns of parents are psychological burdens of identifying their childÃ¢ÂÂs secondary MAVs and fear of insurance discrimination. WGS data are analyzed using separate bioinformatics pipelines for primary disorder variants, structural variants and secondary variants. Initial WGS analyses have already yielded clinical diagnoses not revealed by conventional testing and support our hypothesis that WGS is superior to conventional multi gene panels and clinical microarrays for identifying pathologic variants.",2014

20797,"Introduction: The recent identification of multiple dominant mutations in both humans and mice has enabled us to explore the molecular and cel lular basis of beta catenin function in cognitive impairment. Mutations in human beta catenin have been identified as causative in a spectrum of neurodevelopmental disorders. Methods and Results: In identifying de novo beta catenin mutations in patients with intellectual disability and careful characterization of their phenotype, we were able to define a recognizable intellectual disability syndrome. We have collected detailed clinical informa tion of 7 patients with this novel syndrome. In parallel, the characterization of a chemically mutagenized mouse line displaying features that are similar to these human mutations has enabled us to investigate the consequences of beta catenin dysfunction through development and into adulthood. The mouse mutant, batface, carrying a Thr653Lys substitution in the C terminal armadillo repeat in beta catenin, displays a reduced affinity for membrane associated cadherins. In association with this decreased cadherin inter action, we found that the mutation results in decreased intrahemispheric connections with deficits in dendritic branching, long term potentiation and cognitive function. Conclusion: For the first time in vivo we showed how dominant mutations in beta catenin underlie losses in its adhesion related functions leading to severe consequences including intellectual disability, childhood hypotonia, progressive spasticity of lower limbs and abnormal craniofacial features in adults.

To identify further Mendelian causes of intellectual disability (ID), we screened a cohort of 996 individuals with ID for variants in 565 known or candidate genes using a targeted next generation sequencing approach. Seven loss of function mutations (four nonsense variants c.1195A>T , c.1333C>T , c.1866C>G, c.3001C>T and three frameshift variants c.2175 76 delCA, c.3770insG, c.3856delT) were identified in SETD5, a gene predicted to be a methyltransferase. All mutations were compatible with de novo do minant inheritance. The affected individuals had moderate to severe ID with additional variable features of brachycephaly; prominent high forehead with synophrys or striking eyebrows that are full and broad; a long, thin and tubular nose; long narrow upslanting palpebral fissures and large fleshy low set ears. Skeletal anomalies were a frequent finding including significant leg length discrepancy in two cases. Congenital heart defects, inguinal hernia or hypospadias were all reported. Behavioural problems were a prominent feature including an obsessive compulsive disorder, hand flapping with ritualised behaviour and autism. SETD5 lies within the critical interval for the 3p25 microdeletion syndrome. The SETD5 mutation individuals have phenotypic similarity to those previously reported with a deletion in 3p25 and thus loss of SETD5 may be sufficient to account for the clinical features observed in this condition. Our findings add to the growing evidence that mutations in methyltransferases that regulate histone modification are im portant causes of ID. This analysis provides sufficient evidence that loss of function of SETD5 is a relatively frequent cause of ID (0.7%) and occurs as a rare de novo mutational event.",2014
20799,"Different genes of the glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor synthesis pa thway, PIGV, PIGO, and PGAP2, have recently been implicated in hyperphos phatasia mental retardation syndrome (HPMRS), also known as Mabry syn drome, a rare autosomal recessive form of intellectual disability with cha racteristic additional phenotypic features. We developed a diagnostic gene panel for targeting all known genes of the GPI anchor synthesis pathway to screen patients matching these features, and detected compound hete rozygous and homozygous mutations (c.439dupC, c.914A>G, c.314C>G) in PGAP3, a gene that is involved in the GPI anchor maturation, in two unrela ted patients with developmental delay, elevated serum alkaline phosphatase, seizures and particular facial anomalies. Our functional studies show that an impairment of the later GPI anchor remodeling steps also causes HPMRS. In addition we analyzed the mutation spectrum of all four genes as well as the associated phenotypic spectrum in a large cohort of individuals diagnosed with HPMRS. Among this cohort biallelic PIGV mutations were identified in about 50 % of unrelated families whereas mutations of the other involved genes are less frequent. Our findings demonstrate that the severe end of the clinical spectrum presents as a multiple congenital malformation syndrome with a high frequency of Hirschsprung disease as well as vesicoureteral, re nal, and anorectal malformations. At the other end of this spectrum HPMRS could present as apparently non syndromic form of intellectual disability. Taken together with recent data, HPMRS displays a heterogeneous etiology caused by impairment of different steps of the GPI anchor synthesis and is associated with a marked clinical variability regarding additional malforma tions and growth patterns.",2014
20800,"Despite abundant evidence for pathogenicity of large CNVs in neuro deve lopmental disorders (NDDs), the individual significance of genome wide rare CNVs <500 kb has not been well elucidated in a clinical context. By high resolution chromosomal microarray analysis, we investigated non polymor phic exonic CNVs sizing 1 500 kb in a cohort of 714 patients with NDDs, of which 8.8% had an obvious large disease causing CNV. Excluding recurrent false positive sites, we detected 96 small CNVs, of which 58 (60.4%) could be confirmed by secondary testing. Six of the confirmed de novo or likely de novo CNVs were clearly pathogenic affecting the recurrent microdeletion region in 17q21.31 or OMIM morbid genes (CASK, CREBBP , PAFAH1B1, SATB2). Two further de novo CNVs affec ting single genes (MED13L , CTNND2) were instrumental in delineating no vel recurrent conditions. In addition, two unreported homozygous deletions were found likely pathogenic: An intragenic deletion of ACOT7 which likely defines a novel autosomal recessive disorder, and a deletion of the genes PREPL and C2orf34 representing a new variant of the hypotonia cystinuria syndrome. Four of the inherited CNVs affecting previously reported sites (16p11.2, AUTS2 , NRXN3, GRM8 ) were also considered likely pathogenic. In total 14 (24.1%) of the small CNVs were categorized as pathogenic or likely pathogenic (median size 130 kb), nine (15.5%) as likely benign and the rest remained unclear. These results verifies the diagnostic relevance of geno me wide rare CNVs <500 kb (overall ~2%; 1.1% de novo, 0.3% homozygous, 0.6% inherited) and their inherent potential for discovery of new conditions enabling better characterization of NDDs.",2014

It is a longitudinal, prospective, population biobank linked to comprehensive personal, educa tional, medical and daily life data of 5% of the Estonian adult population. Within a subset of 6819 individuals, we identified 60 carriers of known genomic disorder lesions, equivalent to a prevalence of 1% in the general adult population. Their phenotypes are reminiscent of those of carriers of identical rearrangements identified in disease cohorts. Importantly some of the associated traits appear to have been previously overlooked due to age dependent penetrance. We then generated the genome wide map of rare autosomal CNVs and iden tified a total of 697 carriers of CNVs Ã¢ÂÂ¥ 250 kb with MAF Ã¢ÂÂ¤ 0.05%. While duplication carriers are equally distributed in both sexes, we observe a si gnificant bias towards female carriers of deletion. This biased mutational burden supports the notion that females are somewhat Ã¢ÂÂprotectedÃ¢ÂÂ from neurodevelopmental disorders. Cumulatively, these CNV carriers show a significant increase in the prevalence of intellectual disability and a decrea se in the rate of higher achieved education level, as well as a decrease of female carriersÃ¢ÂÂ fertility. In addition to CNV size, these effects are associated with the number and Ã¢ÂÂqualityÃ¢ÂÂ of encompassed genes and pronounced in carriers of deletions and duplications that encompass Ã¢ÂÂ¥3 and Ã¢ÂÂ¥10 genes, respectively.

We previously showed that increased dosage of methyl CpG binding prote in 2 (MeCP2) leads to a severe neurodevelopmental disorder in males, desi gnated as the MECP2 duplication syndrome (MIM#300260). The increased dosage of MeCP2 is the result of a copy number gain at Xq28, including the MECP2 gene and results in severe to profound neurodevelopmental delay with onset at birth, limited or absent speech, hypotonia, epilepsy, autistic behavior and motor dysfunction. We developed induced pluripotent stem cells from 3 patients with MECP2 duplication syndrome carrying different duplication sizes, to study the impact of increased MePC2 dosage in human neurons. Differentiation of these iPSCs into neurons of cortical identity sho wed modulation in the expression of progenitor genes like BLBP and FOXG1 and cortical genes like RELN, CTIP2, TBR1 and VGLUT. Cortical neurons derived from Mecp2dup iPSCs had more synapses, and altered network synchronization as well as dendritic complexity. Next, we tested a series of epigenetic drugs for the ability to rescue neuronal defects and validated two HDAC inhibitors as potential clinical candidates.

20803,"Pulmonary veno occlusive disease (PVOD) is a rare and devastating cause of pulmonary hypertension that is characterized histologically by widespread fibrous intimal proliferation of septal veins and preseptal venules and is frequently associated with pulmonary capillary dilatation and proliferation. PVOD presents either sporadically or as familial cases. In the French referral centre for severe pulmonary hypertension, we have identified 13 PVOD families: 5 with a confirmed diagnosis based on histo logical studies and 8 with a highly likely diagnosis, based on clinical, func tional, and radiological criteria. All PVOD families were characterized by the presence of at least two affected siblings and unaffected parents, suggesting that the disease segregates as a recessive trait. We used a whole exome sequencing approach and detected recessive mu tations (homozygous or compound heterozygous) in the EIF2AK4 gene that co segregated with PVOD in all 5 families initially studied. We subsequently identified mutations in the 8 additional PVOD families. We also found bi allelic EIF2AK4 mutations in 5 of 20 histologically confirmed sporadic PVOD cases. All identified mutations disrupted the function of the gene. In conclu sion, we identified the first gene responsible for PVOD. Biallelic mutations in EIF2AK4 gene were found in 100% of familial cases and in 25% of spo radic cases of PVOD, making this new gene a major player linked to PVOD development. This discovery significantly contributes towards understan ding the complex genetic architecture of pulmonary hypertension.

Congenital heart defects are the most common birth defect worldwide and a leading cause of neonatal mortality. Left ventricular outflow tract obstruc tion (LVOTO) is an important subtype, with lesions on the most severe end of this spectrum being significantly life limiting. Although mutations in seve ral genes have been associated with LVOTO in the majority of cases the cau se is still unknown. In an individual with LVOTO and a balanced chromoso me translocation, the highly conserved NR2F2 was found to be interrupted. Whole mount studies in mice showed Nr2f2 to be expressed in the atria and in human fetal samples, expression was also confirmed in the heart including in atrial tissue. A further study conducted exome sequencing in 13 parent offspring trios and 112 unrelated patients with nonsyndromic atrioven tricular septal defects, a further important subtype of CHD for which the genetic architecture is poorly understood. Five rare missense variants (two of which arose de novo) were found in NR2F2 , a very significant enrichment (P,7.7ÃÂ10 7) compared to 5,194 controls. A further two CHD families were identified with other variants in NR2F2 ; a de novo substitution disrupting a splice donor site and a 3bp insertion that co segregated in a multiplex fa mily. NR2F2 encodes a pleiotropic developmental transcription factor, and decreased dosage of NR2F2 in mice has been shown to result in abnormal heart development. Furthermore, using luciferase assays, it was shown that all six coding sequence variants observed in patients significantly alter the activity of NR2F2 target promoters. *These authors contributed equally to this work",2014

Venous anomalies are composed of ectatic veins with irregular smooth muscle coverage. They are commonly cutaneous. They usually occur as a single lesion without family history (sporadic Venous Malformation, VM). Some sporadic patients have multifocal lesions (Multifocal Sporadic Venous Malformation, MSVM). In the sporadic Blue Rubber Bleb Nevus syndrome (BRBN), patients also have multifocal lesions; pathognomonic are rubbery palmoplantar lesions and those located in the GI track. In rare cases, venous malformations are multifocal because of autosomal dominant inheritance (Mucocutaneous Venous Malformation, VMCM). VMs progressively expand causing deformity, pain and local intravascular coagulopathy. Despite sclero therapy or excision, lesions often progress or recur. We have identified activating mutations in the endothelial tyrosine kinase receptor TIE2 in all four forms. VMs are mostly due to a single somatic ami no acid change L914F. MSVMs and BRBNs are due to double mutations in cis. The BRBN mutations are somatic, whereas MSVM mutations seem mo saic. Moreover, a distinct cis mutation is seen in MSVM. The inherited VMCM is due to a germline mutation combined with a somatic second hit. These clinico genetic entities are reflected by phenotypic differences in cells over expressing mutant receptors. Activation of AKT is yet a common phenome non. The capacity to form lesions clearly resides in mutant endothelial cells, which when injected to immunodeficient mice generate lesions mimicking human VM. Interestingly, an mTOR inhibitor is able to deter lesion develop ment. Finally, in our therapeutic pilot study comprising five patients with VMs refractory to standard of care, an mTOR inhibitor diminished pain, in travascular coagulopathy and improved quality of life.",2014

20808,"Elevated body mass index (BMI) associates with cardiometabolic traits on observational analysis, yet the underlying causal relationships remain unclear. We conducted Mendelian randomization analyses using 14 SNPs as sociated with BMI from a recent discovery analysis to investigate the causal role of BMI with cardiometabolic traits. We used eight population based co horts, including 34,538 individuals of European ancestry with 4,407 type 2 diabetes (T2D), 6,073 coronary heart disease (CHD) and 3,813 stroke cases. A genetically elevated one kg/m 2 increase in BMI resulted in higher levels of fasting glucose, insulin, interleukin 6 and systolic blood pressure but redu ced levels of HDL C and LDL C (values reported in Table). Apart from LDL C, all causal estimates were directionally concordant to observational esti mates. A genetically elevated one kg/m 2 increase in BMI increased odds of T2D but did not affect risk of CHD or stroke. A meta analysis incorporating published studies with 27,465 CHD events in 219,423 individuals yielded a pooled odds ratio of 1.04 (95%CI: 0.97, 1.12) per 1 kg/m2 increase in BMI. In conclusion, we identified causal effects of BMI on several cardiometabolic traits, however whether BMI causally impacts on CHD risk requires further evidence. Table.

Screening for de letions in seven additional families revealed three large deletions (0.484, 1.164 and 4.7 MB), containing at least the entire candidate gene. Further three patients are currently being analysed. In two patients, no mutation was identified. All mutations and one deletion were inherited from a healthy parent, but in no case a second mutation was found in the coding region of the gene. Whole genome sequencing was performed in five patients, in all a 34 bp promoter deletion on the other allele of the same gene was identified.

20810,"A large group of sporadic developmental disorders involving the skin are or may be caused by postzygotic mutational events. Although mosaic birth defects traditionally rank among the most complex forms of monogenic di seases for gene discovery studies due to the challenges of detecting mutati ons present in only a fraction of cells, exome sequencing recently emerged as a powerful tool in the context of postzygotic mosaicism. In recent years, we and others have identified mutations of PIK3CA and other PI3K/AKT/MTOR pathway genes in several mosaic overgrowth syndromes including megalencephaly capillary malformation, hemimegalencephaly, fibroadipo se hyperplasia, Proteus, CLOVES, and Klippel Trenaunay syndromes. So matic HRAS and KRAS mutations were reported in isolated and syndromic sebaceous nevi, and GNAQ mutations were associated with Sturge Weber syndrome and port wine stains. To further study the genetic basis of mosaic birth defects involving the skin, we ascertained and collected blood and skin specimens from > 100 unrelated individuals with patterns of skin lesions suggestive of cutaneous mosaicism. Systematic targeted deep sequencing of known causative genes on a MiSeq instrument (Illumina) in subjects with a clinical presentation consistent with the aforementioned syndromes resul ted in a diagnostic yield over 50% and led to identification of variants with allelic fractions as low as 1%. Exome sequencing studies based on paired samples or trios in subjects with a clinical presentation of unknown genetic cause led to identification of two new genes underlying two mosaic skin pig mentation syndromes. These findings highlight the value of next generation sequencing, both for research and genetic diagnosis of mosaic skin disor ders.",2014
20811,"Stormorken syndrome is a rare autosomal dominant disorder characterized by miosis, thrombocytopenia/thrombocytopathy, mild hypocalcaemia, mus cle fatigue, asplenia, dyslexia and ichthyosis. Presence of tubular aggregates has also been reported in muscle biopsies of adolescent and adult patients with the disease. We diagnosed Stormorken syndrome in four patients from two unrelated families. Using targeted sequencing and whole exome se quencing we identified the c.910C>T transition in a STIM1 allele (p. R304W) only in patients and not in their unaffected family members. Stromal inter action molecule 1 protein (STIM1) is a finely tuned endoplasmic reticulum (ER) Ca2+ sensor. The effect of the mutation on the structure of STIM1 was investigated by molecular modeling, and its effect on function was explored by calcium homeostasis experiments. We show that STIM1 p. R304W variant may affect the conformation of the inhibitory helix and unlock the inhibito ry state of STIM1 molecule. Results obtained from calcium imaging experi ments using transfected cells together with the fibroblasts from one affected patient were in agreement with impairment of calcium homeostasis. The p. R304W mutation probably causes a constant Ca2+ release activated Ca2+ channels (CRAC) opening leading to a permanent entry of calcium in many cell types. Our results are in agreement with already published models for STIM1 structure and activation. We conclude that p. R304W mutation in STIM1 may be the cause of the Stormorken syndrome.",2014
20812,"Neural crest cells (NCC) are progenitors of diverse cell types such as peri pheral neurons and glia as well as melanocytes. Via an insertional mutation screen for loci affecting NCC, we identified several mouse lines that combine defects in pigmentation and formation of the enteric nervous system. One of these lines, named TashT , displays an aganglionic megacolon phenotype in a subset of homozygotes and, most interestingly, almost exclusively in males. This is highly reminiscent of human HirschsprungÃ¢ÂÂs disease, a neurocristo pathy with an incidence of 1/5000 newborns and a currently unexplained 4:1 male to female bias. We localized the TashT transgene insertion site in a gene desert containing multiple highly conserved elements on chromosome 10. Migration assays as well as time lapse imaging showed that megacolon is due to defective NCC migration within the gut mesenchyme, a defect generally more severe in males than females. At the molecular level, RNAseq analysis of TashT en teric NCC notably revealed upregulation of many genes encoding secreted proteins and downregulation of several X linked genes. This analysis also identified the novel gene Fam162b as a strong candidate for being the TashT causative gene. Fam162b is located near the transgene insertion site and reporter gene as well as 3C assays suggest that this TashT overexpressed gene is normally repressed in NCC via long range interactions with some of the highly conserved elements near the transgene insertion site. Altogether, our results demonstrate that the TashT line represents a unique mouse model that will help understand the male sex bias of HirschsprungÃ¢ÂÂs disease.",2014

The cohesin complex is formed from a multi subunit core and their asso ciated regulatory proteins. Genetic variants within components of the cohesin complex (NIPBL, SMC1A, SMC3, RAD21, PDS5, ESCO2, HDAC8) are believed to be responsible for a spectrum of human syndromes known as Ã¢ÂÂcohesinopathiesÃ¢ÂÂ that includes Cornelia de Lange Syndrome (CdLS), a multiple malformation syndrome affecting almost any organ and causing severe developmental delay. The co hesin complex has a canonical role in cell division and a non canonical role in gene expression regulation. Cohesinopathies seem to be caused by dys regulation of specific developmental pathways downstream of mutations in cohesin components. However, it is still unclear how mutations in different components of the cohesin complex effect the output of gene regulation. In this study, zebrafish embryos and patient derived fibroblasts were used to analyze abnormalities underlying CdLS, focusing on SMC1A, the second most commonly mutated gene responsible for the disease. We show that the knockdown of smc1a in zebrafish impairs neural development, increases apoptosis and specifically downregulates the canonical Wnt pathway that can be rescued by chemical activation suggesting a therapeutic potential for CdLS. The same downregulation of the WNT pathway is observed in SMC1A mutated patient fibroblasts. Previously we have demonstrated that the ha ploinsufficiency of NIPBL, the cohesin gene mutated in Cornelia de Lange Syndrome, produces a similar phenotype in zebrafish and in CdLS patients. Finally, the double knockdown of nipblb/smc1a in zebrafish shows a syner gistic effect for the canonical role of cohesins in cell cycle and survival.

20814,"Cornelia de Lange syndrome (CdLS) is a highly variable multisystem disor der with a broad phenotypic spectrum. Most typically affected individuals carry de novo heterozygous loss of function mutations in NIPBL. Mutati ons in other components of the sister chromatid cohesion system, SMC1A, HDAC8, SMC3 and RAD21, result in phenotypes that overlap with CdLS but which can be highly atypical. We carried out trio based exome sequencing in ten unrelated individuals with the diagnosis of atypical CdLS, who had pre viously been screened for intragenic mutations in the known CdLS genes and for genomic deletions or duplications. Using a likelihood based approach, we identified nine de novo variants in eight cases, including de novo loss of function mutations in NIPBL (c.3150delA [p. Glu1050Aspfs*20]) and KM T2A (c.3649G>T [p. Glu1217*]), an essential splice site mutation in PUF60 (c.604 2A>C) and a missense mutation in NAA10 (c.247C>T [p. Arg83Cys]). Furthermore, de novo, probably damaging missense mutations were identi fied in PIK3C3, PDCD6IP , UNC45A, NUP210 and CELF3. We then re sequen ced these genes in 85 of our mutation negative CdLS and CdLS like cases by AmpliSeq Ion Torrent sequencing, which revealed three additional loss of function mutations in KMT2A. We also detected the aforementioned de novo mutation in NAA10 (c.247C>T [p. Arg83Cys]) in a similarly affected, but unrelated individual. Molecular modelling suggests that the p. Arg83Cys conversion is likely to alter binding of NAA10 to acetyl CoA and would re sult in reduced acetylation activity of the protein. Our results highlight the genetic heterogeneity in atypical CdLS. They also demonstrate the phenoty pic overlap between atypical CdLS and other dysmorphic conditions such as Wiedemann Steiner syndrome as shown by molecular data.",2014
20815,"We have recently shown that the majority of predisposing autoimmune di sease SNPs are intronic or intergenic and have the potential to be regulatory (RicaÃÂ±o Ponce & Wijmenga, 2013) by affecting expression of nearby genes (so called eQTLs). It has become clear that non coding RNAs are an impor tant class of regulatory elements. Annotating autoimmune SNPs shows that close to 10% map to long non coding RNA genes (lncRNA). Transcriptome analysis across 11 distinct immune cell types (granulocytes, monocytes, NK cells, B cells, memory T cells, naive CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, and four CD4+ T helper cell populations) revealed that these Ã¢ÂÂautoimmuneÃ¢ÂÂ lncRNAs are si gnificantly enriched in immune cell types. We also correlated the autoimmu ne SNP genotypes with expression levels (eQTLs) of both coding genes and lncRNA genes and observed > 70% of the autoimmune SNPs to be eQTLs. Interestingly, ~16% of these eQTL SNPs also affect lncRNAs and as high as 6% of these eQTLs are specific to lncRNAs alone. To gain a first understan ding on the biological processes in which these Ã¢ÂÂautoimmuneÃ¢ÂÂ lncRNAs are involved we performed pathway analysis based on co expression profiles of lncRNAs and protein coding genes using 5000 publicly available RNAseq samples. More than 90% of the autoimmune lncRNAs were significantly co expressed with genes in cis (P , 0.009 to 4.64 x 10 92) that are at an average distance of 245 kb. Our results show that lncRNA eQTLs represent a novel link between non coding SNPs and the expression of genes, which can be exploited to understand the process of gene regulation through lncRNAs in more detail.",2014
20816,"Diseases are known to be associated with large (>1kb) genomic structural variation (SV). A variety of techniques such as karyotyping, FISH and array CGH have been used for SV analysis. However, population scale comprehen sive SV analysis remains impractical too expensive or incomplete (exempli fied by missing inversions and balanced translocations by aCGH methods). More recently, next generation sequencing (NGS) has been shown efficient for discovery of SNPs and small indels. However, complete and accurate SV discovery and analysis is complicated by the fact that variants often span tens to hundreds of kb or are rearranged throughout the genome, difficult to infer from short fragment sequencing. Thus, there is a blind spot in effec tively detecting SVs within this range (1 kb ~ 1 Mb), referred to as the Ã¢ÂÂdark matterÃ¢ÂÂ of the genome, overlooked in the past due to insufficient tools. We demonstrate a new platform technology (Irys) to effectively linearize very long strands of gDNA (100 kb to Mbs) through nanochannels to directly visualize SVs and rearrangements preserved within intact and unamplified genomic DNA at single molecule level. De novo genome maps are assembled and hundreds to thousands of SV events are called. Data from individuals and trio families will demonstrate this highly comprehensive and cost effec tive approach, with results validated by multiple orthogonal methods. For the first time, it is now feasible to do large population based compre hensive structural variation studies using a single platform.

20818,"Whole exome sequencing has revolutionized rare disease research, with over 100 disease gene identifications since the first published success in 2010. However, many cases remain unsolved due to the fact that ~100 1000 loss of function, candidate variants remain after removing those deemed as common, low quality or non pathogenic. In some cases it may be pos sible to use multiple affected individuals, linkage data, identity by descent inference, trio analysis, or prior knowledge of affected pathways to narrow down to the causative variant. Where this is not possible or successful, one approach is to use model organism phenotype data to evaluate whether a variant is likely to result in the patientÃ¢ÂÂs clinical manifestations. We have developed an algorithmic approach (PHenotypic Interpretation of Variants in Exomes; PHIVE) to semantically compare clinical and mouse phenotypes. The output is combined with measures of variant candidacy such as patho genicity and allele frequency and synergistically improves performance: the causative variant is identified as the top hit in up to 83% of exomes, with a 54 fold improvement over variant based prioritization alone. A web imple mentation (Exomiser) is freely available. Another complementary approach we have developed ranks exome candi dates based on their proximity in protein protein networks to genes shown, or are suspected, to be associated with the disease. Again, combining this with variant based measures of candidacy leads to large improvements in performance with up to 47% of exomes having the causative variant as the top candidate. We are currently testing our approach in large scale projects such as the Undiagnosed Disease Program and CareForRare.",2014

Lysosome is a control centre for cellular clearance and energy metabolism: it is responsible for the degradation of the foreign molecules and the en dogenous macromolecules. The essential role of lysosomes in phagocytosis and autophagy puts these organelles at the crossroads of several cellular processes. To understand the role of the lysosomal autophagic endocytic pathway in health and disease, we have developed LysoPlex, a Next Gene ration Sequencing based workflow to sequence at high coverage 12,786 human exons of 891 genes involved in lysosomal function, endocytosis and autophagy pathway. We designed the enrichment probes using a Haloplex custom platform targeting 99.48% of exons. To validate the methodology, we created a training set of 15 DNA samples belonging to patients affected by 14 different LSDs, whose the molecular diagnosis was already known. Using LysoPlex, we were able to detect all the known mutations. Moreover, we used our strategy to identify disease causing mutations in 50 patients clinically diagnosed as affected by neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses (NCL). About 50% of samples have causative mutations and a subset of additional variations in other genes not directly correlated with the disease was also identified in each sample. In conclusion, LysoPlex is a cheap and fast NGS targeted platform for the molecular diagnosis of Mendelian LSDs and it is a precious tool to have a complete view of sequence variants in the genes involved in the lysosomal autophagic pathway.

Here we show that we have generated a generic automated ion semiconduc tor sequencing workflow which can be used in a clinical setting.

20821,"Before replacing gene by gene Sanger sequencing with genome wide NGS, it is essential that diagnostic laboratories investigate the relation between sequencing depth and test characteristics such as false positive/negative rates, yield and coverage of relevant regions. In addition, capture bias needs to be evaluated when choosing between whole exome (WES) and whole ge nome sequencing (WGS).To determine these factors we investigated 9 samples sequenced in diagno stic laboratories using both WES and WGS and 4 samples analysed by SNP array and deep sequenced by WES. As intellectual disability (ID) is consi dered the primary indication for diagnostics using WES/WGS, we focused on a panel of ~400 ID genes. We observed no false negatives in WES versus WGS for the ID gene panel region. In contrast, duplicated regions and regi ons with many variants in close proximity were problematic, suffering from increased false negative rates (> 1/100).Subsequently we determined minimal sequencing criteria by applying GATKÃ¢ÂÂs experimental reference confidence score model on subsets of WES data (20 140*10 6 mapped reads). This revealed that (1) false positive ra tes are negligible, (2) false negative rates are below 1/1000, (3) the yield of identified variants is >95% with >30*10 6 mapped reads (~35X average depth), and (4) adequate depth can be reached for >95% of the bases of the ID gene panel with >60*10 6 mapped reads (~70X average depth) and >99% with > 140*106 mapped reads (~160X average depth).

Next generation sequencing (NGS) is quickly being optimized for use in dia gnostics. The technologies bring challenges at the technical level, in terms of data management and in the interpretation of results. Over the past 2 years, guidelines have been issued by the American, Australian, Dutch and British genetic professional societies. At EuroGentest, an expert group has been working on compiling, integrating and completing these guidelines. For in stance, we believe that defining the Ã¢ÂÂdiagnostic utilityÃ¢ÂÂ of the NGS test is the laboratoryÃ¢ÂÂs first duty when preparing to offer diagnostic NGS. Second, we introduce a scoring system for the different NGS assays depending on their quality and comprehensiveness. This is important for patients and clinicians to allow comparison of the diagnostic offer from the different laboratories. It could also be used by the health care system to evaluate and reimburse the tests. This scoring system is new, as it does not feature in any other gui deline. As far as Ã¢ÂÂreportable rangeÃ¢ÂÂ is concerned, we propose the use of 3 specific percentages depending on the reference (technical target, coverage of transcript in a gene panel, coverage with reference to the genome) which will again allow to compare individual results within runs, between tests and between laboratories. The guidelines propose a template for reporting NGS results as well.

To address this issue, we surveyed the potential false negative rate of mutations in the 56 ACMG genes. We retrospectively, analyzed forty four exome datasets from four dif ferent exome capture kits and two sequence platforms. The exome methods were examined for their ability to detect clinically relevant mutations in the 56 ACMG genes.

The worst performing method was predicted to miss >90% of clinically significant variant positions in the genes TMEM43, PCSK9, KCNQ1 and LMNA.

20824,"Chromosome missegregation leading to chromosomal instability, is thought to play a pivotal role in cancer development. As major cohesin function is to assure correct chromosome segregation, increasing data suggests its in volvement in tumorigenesis. Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a useful model for investigating the role of cohesin in carcinogenesis. CRC develops over the course of many years as a consequence of the accumulation of specific muta tions in both oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes. These mutations ari se in a characteristic sequence leading to early adenoma/dysplastic crypt, late adenoma and carcinoma. Two types of genomic instability have been identified in CRC: chromosomal instability (CIN), is present in around 85% of colorectal cancers, while the remaining 15% shows microsatellite insta bility (MSI). CIN was proposed as the major cause of cancer development more than 100 years ago, but its molecular mechanisms have not yet been completely defined. In this regard, the identification of gene(s) that gives rise to a CIN phenotype at an early stage of CRC development has been chal lenging. To this aim, we analyzed colorectal early adenomas and identified eleven mutations in SMC1A core cohesin subunit. Transfection of the SMC1A mutants identified in early adenomas and wild type SMC1A gene silencing in normal human fibroblasts led to chromosomal instability. Since SMC1A is an X linked gene, our finding suggests that a single allele mutation is enough to trigger chromosomal instability and tumorigenesis.

Here, the Evidence based Network for the Interpretation of Germ line Mutant Alleles (ENIGMA) consortium combines RT PCR, exon scanning, cloning, sequencing, and relative semi quantification to describe naturally occurring BRCA1 alternative splicing with unprecedented resolution. The study has been conducted in blood related RNA sources,commonly used for clinical splicing assays, as well as in one healthy breast tissue. We have characterized a total of 63 BRCA1 alternative splicing events, including 35 novel findings. A minimum of 10 splicing events (Ã¢ÂÂ1Aq, Ã¢ÂÂ5, Ã¢ÂÂ5q, Ã¢ÂÂ8p, Ã¢ÂÂ9, Ã¢ÂÂ(9,10), Ã¢ÂÂ9_11, Ã¢ÂÂ11q, Ã¢ÂÂ13p, and Ã¢ÂÂ14p) represent a substantial fraction of the full length expression level (ranging from 5% to 100%). Remarkably, our data indicates that BRCA1 alternative splicing is similar in blood and breast, a finding supporting the clinical relevance of blood based in vitro splicing assays. Overall, our data suggests an alternative splicing model in which most non mutually exclusive alternative splicing events are randomly combined into individual mRNA molecules to produce hundreds of different BRCA1 iso forms.",2014

The genes responsible for the remaining cases of HDGC, as well as other familial gastric cancers (FGC) are current ly unknown. We examined a large family with FGC and no CDH1 mutations using a combination of genetic mapping with high density SNP arrays and exome sequencing and identified that the cancer is associated with a germ line coding variant (p. P946L) in mitogen activated protein kinase kinase kinase 6 (MAP3K6) . A somatic second hit (p. H506Y) was present in DNA ob tained directly from a tumor specimen of an affected individual. Screening of 115 unrelated individuals with non CDH1 FGC identified the p. P946L va riant, as well as four additional coding variants in MAP3K6 (p. F849Sfs*142, p. P958T , p. D200Y and p. V207G). These probands were negative for muta tions in another 50 genes with links to gastrointestinal cancers also being screened in this cohort. These findings, together with what is known from mouse models about the role MAP3K6 plays in oncogenesis, and previous studies showing the presence of somatic mutations in MAP3K6 in non he reditary gastric cancers, indicate that MAP3K6 variants are a predisposing factor for FGC.",2014
20827,"Background Mutations in PTCH1 have been identified in approximately 70% of individuals with Gorlin syndrome. Methods Gorlin families were screened for PTCH1 mutations by DNA and RNA sequencing and MLPA. Selected cases without an identified mutation with more than one affected member under went exome sequencing. Results PTCH1 mutations were identified in 42/70 (60%) of families fulfilling Gorlin syndrome criteria. Exome sequencing of four PTCH1 negative patients revealed a heterozygous germline SUFU mu tation, c.550C>T (p. Gln184*), in one individual. Sanger sequencing of 23 further PTCH1 negative families identified a novel heterozygous SUFU mis sense mutation, c.544G>T (p. Asp182Tyr). MLPA screening of SUFU defined a deletion in one family, starting between exons 3 and 5 and removing the 3Ã¢ÂÂ end of the gene. All affected SUFU positive families contained a single case of medulloblastoma. Of 171 individuals meeting Gorlin syndrome criteria 115 (67%) have a PTCH1 mutation and 10 a SUFU mutation. Only two of 115 (1.8%) with a PTCH1 mutation have developed pathology proven medull oblastoma. Three of ten individuals from three families with SUFU related Gorlin syndrome developed a medulloblastoma. Three cranial tumours oc curred in follow up of two SUFU mutation cases, two meningiomas and a pilocytic astrocytoma. Conclusions The risk of medulloblastoma in Gorlin syndrome is reported as 5%. Our study redefines the risk of medulloblasto ma in PTCH1 related Gorlin syndrome as ~2%, with a risk around 15 times higher in SUFU related Gorlin syndrome. We also show convincingly for the first time that SUFU mutations cause classical Gorlin syndrome.",2014
20828,"Most of the conventional anti cancer chemotherapies inhibit proliferation and survival of cancer cells by inducing DNA damages, are potentially mu tagenic and therefore might promote development of secondary tumours, in particular in patients with inherited cancer risk. The p53 pathway is acti vated in response to any genotoxic stress. Our team has recently developed a new functional assay of p53 in human lymphocytes in order to classify the different germline TP53 mutations detected in Li Fraumeni syndrome. We adapted this assay to develop an universal genotoxicity test based on specific detection of p53 pathway induction. This simple test is based on the exposure of human wild type TP53 lymphocytes to chemical or physical agents, then on the measurement by RT QMPSF of p53 target gene expres sion. The specificity of the p53 pathway induction is demonstrated by the same experiment carried out in lymphocytes harbouring a heterozygous TP53 mutation, which compromises the response to genotoxic stress. Using this test, we evaluated the genotoxicity of the conventional anti cancer drugs commonly used. This analysis revealed that all classes of anti cancer drugs are genotoxic, with the exception of the mitotic spindle poisons, such as paclitaxel or derivatives of vinca alkaloids. These results suggest that the remarkable high rate of multiple primary tumours observed in patients with Li Fraumeni syndrome may be due in part to the mutagenic effect of che motherapies, and that the use of microtubules poisons may be of particular interest in these patients. This new functional assay should facilitate the identification of new non genotoxic anti cancer molecules.",2014

However, many of the found variants are of uncertain significance (VUS), which complicates their risk assessment and calls for functional ana lyses before predictive gene testing and genetic counseling are offered to a family. Methods: 5 MLH1 and 4 MSH2 variants were identified in a set of Italian families with suspected LS. The probands from these families were investigated by sequencing of the coding regions of the genes and by mi crosatellite instability (MSI) and immunohistochemical (IHC) analyses of MMR proteins on tumor samples. Functional significance of the 9 putative LS predisposing VUS was analyzed in an in vitro MMR assay and expression/stability of the mutated variants evaluated by Western blot analysis (WB). Results: As a result, 2 MLH1 and 3 MSH2 variants showed no repair in the assay and were assessed as pathogenic, whereas 3 MLH1 and 1 MSH2 vari ant repaired as the wild type protein and were assessed as proficient. Lowe red protein expression patterns in WB as well as in silico analysis together with MSI and IHC data further supported their pathogenicity. Conclusions: The functional analysis together with clinical, tumor pathological and in si lico analysis helped to confirm pathogenicity in 5 out of 9 putative Lynch syndrome variants.",2014
20830,"Genetic variants in the SHANK2 gene have been previously reported in pati ents with intellectual disability and autism spectrum disorder. Our study fo cused on the analysis of SHANK2 variants associated with schizophrenia. We analyzed all exons and exon intron boundaries of the ProSAP1A_AB208026 isoform of SHANK2 by Sanger sequencing in a cohort of 481 schizophrenia patients (177 trios and 304 singleton patients) and 374 unaffected indivi duals. We detected ten missense variants that affect protein structure which are only present in the patient group. We used mutation prediction tools that are based on evolutionary protein conservation and chemical properties of amino acids to select the four most promising variants. In silico investigation is helpful to estimate a functional relevance of mutations, but cannot substitute the functional analysis itself. To analyze the functional impact of the four selected mutations, we conduc ted overexpression and knockdown rescue experiments in primary hippo campal neurons from rat with a major focus on morphological changes of the neurons. Another major point of our study was to investigate the effect of different SHANK2 isoforms and schizophrenia mutations on the actin structures. We used COS 7 cells as a model system and live cell TIRF (Total Internal Reflection Fluorescence) microscopy for imaging of actin structu res. Additionally, we also performed actin polymerization assays to measu re in vivo F actin/G actin ratio in our mutants compared to SHANK2 wild type. With these functional tests we were able to show for the first time a functional effect of SHANK2 variants which were identified in schizophrenia patients.",2014

Although ~14% of patients have a family history of parkinsonism in only a small pro portion of such pedigrees have pathogenic mutations been identified to un derlie disease susceptibility. The majority of causal and disease modifying variants remain unknown. We report longitudinal clinical, genealogic and comparative sequence (exome) analyses of affected multi generational fa milies. Genome alignment, variant annotation and comparative analyses were used to identify shared coding mutations. Initially we have examined concordant/discordant variant sharing within multi incident pedigrees (n,10), using Mendelian models and maximum parsimony. We subsequent ly inspected variant segregation with disease and extended these findings to unrelated patients (n,1500) and control subjects (n,1500) of Scandinavi an descent. In two families missense mutations in NOVA2 and RPE65 were found to segregate with parkinsonism and were not observed in control subjects of Scandinavian origin. Both variants were subsequently genotyped in a multi ethnic case control series submitted by the GEOPD Consortium (n,5000). Interestingly, two additional patients with familial parkinsonism were identified as RPE65 carriers and no controls. Moreover, sequencing of entire coding region of RPE65 and NOVA2, in multi ethnic probands with familial parkinsonism (n,100), led us to identify more missense mutations. Our data provides evidence for two novel genes in the etiology of PD.",2014
20832,"Molecular genetic studies have identified a number of susceptibility genes, with the relevant pathways, however, being still largely unknown.microRNAs are a class of small non coding RNAs. Accumulating evidence suggests that microRNAs contribute to basic mechanisms underlying brain development and plasticity thus suggesting their possible involvement in the pathogenesis of several psychiatric disorders, including bipolar disor der. The aim of the present study was to systematically investigate whether com mon variants at all known microRNA loci (miRBase release 13.0) contribute to the development of bipolar disorder. We performed gene based analyses for all microRNAs and +/ 20kb flanking sequences using VEGAS on the lar gest existing GWAS dataset of bipolar disorder comprising of 9,747 patients and 14,278 controls (MÃÂ¼hleisen et al., Nature Commun 2014). In this data set we combined our data obtained from four European countries, Canada, and Australia with the GWAS results of the multinational Psychiatric Geno mics Consortium. Our analysis revealed that 98 of the 609 microRNAs showed nominally si gnificant p values, indicating that bipolar disorder associated microRNAs are enriched within the known microRNA loci (p,0.006). After correction for multiple testing, nine microRNAs (let 7g, miR 135a, miR 499, miR 581, miR 611, miR 640, miR 644, miR 708, miR 1908) showed a significant as sociation with bipolar disorder. These included microRNAs known to be in volved in neural development and synaptic plasticity. Results from the investigation of the affected target genes and underlying regulatory networks supports these disease mechanisms and also suggests new mechanisms.",2014

ORG 31Back to inde x kinase protein involved in multiple cellular processes. In spite of their invol vement in the same disease, a functional interaction between the three ge nes has not been proven and disease mechanism remain elusive. It has been suggested that an excitation/inhibition imbalance might play an important role in Rett pathogenesis. We have used a mouse model and a human model based on patients specific iPSCs derived neurons to test the hypothesis that in maturing neurons an initial excess of excitatory synapses might result in excitotoxicity finally leading to loss of excitatory synapses. We have esta blished 3 iPSC lines for each gene. Quantitative RT PCR on iPSCs derived neurons demonstrated that VGLUT1 is over expressed while GAD1 is down regulated. Similarly, down regulation of another inhibitory marker (VGAT ) is observed in the mouse model. However, in this model a reduction of exci tatory synapses (VGLUT1, GluA1, GluA2, NR1 ) is observed opposite to iPSCs derived neurons. Moreover, RNA and protein analysis shows an over expression of GRID1 , a member of the delta family of ionotropic glutamate receptors which indu ces preferentially inhibitory presynaptic differentiation of cortical neurons. Our data provide evidence in favour of excitotoxicity as an important con tributing factor in Rett pathogenesis due to MECP2 mutations and suggest a similar mechanism for CDKL5 and FOXG1 mutated patients. These results confirm the presence of an imbalance between excitation and inhibition thus providing novel insights into Rett pathophysiology.",2014
20834,"Humans display structural and functional asymmetries in brain organiza tion, strikingly manifested through language and handedness. While we understand the biology of body asymmetries, the molecular basis of brain laterality is still unknown. We report a genome wide association study (GWAS) for a quantitative measure of handedness and dexterity (pegboard) in individuals with dyslexia (n , 728). The most strongly associated variant, rs7182874 (P , 8.68ÃÂ10 9), is located in PCSK6, a gene known to activate NODAL, which is required to regulate left/right body axis determination. A novel approach for GWAS pathway analysis, based on gene set enrichment strategies, showed that left/right asymmetry pathways are associated with handedness in both the dyslexia and a general population (n , 2666) co horts. In particular, genes involved in corpus callosum development were enriched among the GWAS top hits. Furthermore, different markers at the PCSK6 locus were found to be associated with a measure of handiness in a completely independent study. The dyslexia specific marker trait associati on could be the result of an epistatic effect. Recent findings show that dysle xia candidate genes play a role in ciliogenesis, an important developmental process at the basis of left/right structural asymmetries determination. We propose that handedness is a polygenic trait controlled in part by the mole cular mechanisms which establish left/right body asymmetry early in deve lopment, which in turn influence brain midline development and might be implicated in neurodevelopmental disorders. We are now investigating the molecular mechanisms underlying this association using neuronal stem cell and zebrafish models.",2014

Osteoporosis with its consequences, i.e., fractures, is major health problem in ageing societies. As osteoporosis is a prevalent disorder, understanding its etiological factors is very important. We recently identified novel pa thogenic variants in PLS3 (encoding Plastin 3 (PLS3), a filamentous actin bundling protein) as a cause of X linked osteoporosis and osteoporotic frac tures in five Dutch families (van Dijk et al. NEJM 2013:369(16):1529 36). These loss of function variants cause decreased bone mineral density and increased risk of fracture in hemizygous young men whereas the clinical picture in heterozygous women ranged from asymptomatic to early onset osteoporosis. It was highly unexpected that mutations in this gene would cause osteoporosis and fractures as it had never been described as a candi date gene for osteoporosis nor was it known to play a role in bone forma tion. However, results of in vivo analyses in zebrafish strongly supported a role for PLS3 as a bone regulatory protein. Furthermore, a rare variant (rs140121121) in PLS3 was found to be associated with a twofold increased fracture risk in elderly female carriers in the normal population indicating genetic variation in PLS3 as a novel etiological factor involved in common, multifactorial osteoporosis. However, the exact mechanism by which PLS3 mutations cause osteoporosis and fractures is unknown and currently sub ject of further investigations.

Remarkably, affected patients with PLS3 loss of function mutations only presented a bone phenotype.

Based on the presence of additional hand anomalies, we have previously distinguished DBQD type 1 and identified CANT1 (calcium activated nucleotidase 1) mutations as re sponsible for DBQD type 1. We report here the identification of 5 distinct homozygous xylosyltransferase 1 (XYLT1) mutations in 7 DBQD type 2 cases from 6 consanguineous families. Among the 5 mutations, 4 were expected to result in loss of function and a drastic reduction of XYLT1 cDNA level was demonstrated in 2 cultured individual fibroblasts. No significant clinical or radiological differences could be found with the remaining 14 DBQD type 2 cases with unknown molecular bases. However, long term follow up of XYLT1 mutated individuals emphasizes the severity of the short stature (< 6 SD) contrasting with obesity, lower limb and foot deformities requiring often repeated surgeries and intellectual disability (5/7). Interestingly, re spiratory distress was present at birth in 4/7 cases and spontaneously re solved in the first years of life but thorax narrowness persisted in the eldest children. Since xylosyltransferase 1 (XT I) catalyzes the very first step in proteoglycan (PG) biosynthesis, we further demonstrated in the two indivi dual fibroblasts a significant reduction of cellular PG content.

20839,"Auriculocondylar syndrome (ACS) is a rare craniofacial disorder involving micrognathia, condyle hypoplasia and question mark ear (QME). QME, which involves a defect in the fusion of the lobe and helix, can occur as an isolated anomaly. Recently, mutations in PLCB4 and GNAI3 were identified in ACS. Both genes are predicted to function in the endothelin 1 (EDN1) endothelin receptor type A (EDNRA) signalling pathway during the development of the pharyngeal arches. Following exclusion of PLCB4 and GNAI3 in a series of ACS and QME patients, we performed exome sequencing in three unsolved families, and identified a mutation in EDN1 in each case. A fourth EDN1 mu tation was identified by direct sequencing. Two of the four cases involved patients affected with ACS, born to consanguineous, healthy parents; these patients harboured homozygous missense mutations in EDN1, each predic ted to interfere with enzymatic cleavage of the EDN1 pro protein. The other two cases involved patients with dominantly inherited isolated QME; they harboured heterozygous EDN1 mutations a premature stop in one case and a missense mutation affecting a highly conserved residue of the mature EDN1 peptide in the other. The nature of the mutations and the different modes of inheritance suggest that heterozygous loss of function mutations in EDN1 cause isolated QME and that homozygous hypomorphic mutations cause ACS. These are the first reported mutations of EDN1 in humans and suggest that ACS and QME are a phenotypic continuum resulting from im paired EDN1 EDNRA signaling.",2014

Polygenic score analysis was used to show that common risk alleles for clinical ADHD contribute to the risk of having higher ADHD symptoms in the general population (Martin et al. in press). We have used polygenic score analysis to investigate the contribution of common risk variants for clinical ADHD on educational performance and IQ in the general population. MethodsAcademic performance was assessed using results from Key Stage 3 natio nal tests and externally marked GCSE examinations in 6,385 children from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC). Polygenic risk scores were calculated for ALSPAC children and their mothers based on the results of an ADHD GWAS (Stergiakouli et al. 2012).ResultsADHD polygenic scores on the children were associated with worst educa tional outcomes as represented by both time points and also with lower IQ scores at age 15.5 (see Table). Moreover, ADHD polygenic scores on the mo thers were associated with lower IQ in the mothers and worst educational outcomes in the children (see Table).Discussion Our results suggest that the same genetic variants that are relevant for an ADHD diagnosis are also implicated in impaired academic performance in the general population and lower IQ score in both children and adults.

Anorexia nervosa (AN) is marked by extremely low body weight and in tense fear of gaining weight. We evaluated shared genetic determinants of AN and commonly comorbid psychiatric disorders (PsyD) by testing whe ther polygenic risk scores derived from genome wide data of other PsyD can predict AN status. We obtained allele risk scores for major depressive disorder (MDD), bipolar disorder (BPD), autism (AUT), attention deficit hy peractivity disorder (ADHD) and schizophrenia (SCZ) from the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium (PGC). We divided each of these sets into 10 Pt signi ficance level thresholds. The test set comprised AN cases and controls from a published Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium 3 AN GWAS study. For every test set sample, we produced a polygenic risk score as a weighted sum of risk allele scores. Logistic regression was used to assess whether each PsyD polygenic score predicted AN case control status. We computed pseu do R^2 values, and compared these to the values obtained when randomly permuting case control status to measure the proportion of variance in AN explained by each PsyD risk score. Our pseudo R^2 values were ~0.5 1%, comparable to pseudo R^2 values in a recent PGC polygenic score analysis of five PsyD. We computed an empirical p value for every significance thres hold and found significant pseudo R^2 values at the lowest Pt threshold (Pt <0.001) for AN vs AUT (p,0.0009), MDD (p,0.009), and SCZ (0.0008), and at Pt <0.01 for BPD (p,0.0004).

20844,"Several modern technologies, such as nuclear magnetic resonance and mass spectrometry platforms in metabolomics, produce high dimensional phe notype data on individuals. A first step towards utilising high dimensional phenotypes in genetic studies is to understand how their genetic compon ents are related. Recent algorithmic advances in multivariate linear mixed models have enabled variance component estimation for pairs of traits using population samples of individuals and genome wide panels of SNPs. However, current methods have not been tailored for situations where hundreds of traits are available on the same set of individuals. For such settings, we introduce an algorithm that efficiently decomposes pairwise phenotypic correlations into genetic and environmental components. We illustrate our approach with an application to 105 pairs of metabolic and anthropometric traits measured on up to 14,000 Finnish individuals. For example, we estimate that the observed phenotypic correlation ( 0.41) between triglyserides (TG) and HDL cholesterol decomposes into an addi tive genetic correlation ( 0.59, s.e. 0.06) and an environmental correlation ( 0.36 s.e. 0.02).We discuss the interpretation of genetic correlations as correlations bet ween locus wise genetic effects and characterise settings where prior in formation about genetic correlation increases statistical power to identify pleiotropic loci, i.e. loci that contribute to multiple traits.",2014
20845,"Currently, many GWA studies are accompanied by additional analyses to get an estimate of the amount of heritability explained by the GWAS SNPs. Such analyses in unrelated individuals critically depend on the construction of a Genetic Relatedness Matrix (GRM) as implemented for example in the software package GCTA [1]. What sometimes seems a bit surprising is the large variation in the obtained point estimates between studies. Although heritability is a population specific characteristic, these GRM based herita bilities seem more variable than e.g. heritabilities based on twin data. Using genotype data and a wide range of phenotypes from two large population based studies in the Netherlands (NESDA: Netherlands Study of Depression and Anxiety and NTR: Netherlands Twin Register), in addition to a set of si mulated phenotypes, we examined the effects SNP selection based on GWAS QC, relational filters and phenotype transformations. For continuous traits, the results show that the GRM method is sensitive to SNP selection criteria, with or without imputations, as well as deviation of phenotypes from the assumed normal distribution. For dichotomous traits, additional issues in cluding non random missingness of genotypes, play a role. Thus, a substan tial part of the variation in GCTA heritability estimates may depend on data quality control and the selection of study individuals prior to the analysis.1.

20846,"Associations between the level of single transcripts and single corresponding genetic variants, eSNPs, have been extensively studied and reported. Howe ver, most expression traits are complex, involving the cooperative action of multiple SNPs at different loci affecting multiple genes. Finding these coope rating eSNPs by exhaustive search has proven to be statistically challenging. In this paper we utilized availability of sequencing data with transcriptional profiles in the same cohort to identify two kinds of usual suspects: eSNPs that alter coding sequence or eSNPs within the span of transcription factors (TFs). We devised a computational framework for examining pairs of such cooperating source eSNPs that are both associated with the same pair of target transcripts. We characterize such quartets through their genomic, to pological and functional properties. We establish that this regulatory struc ture of cooperating quartets is frequent in real data, but is rarely observed in permutations. eSNP sources are mostly located on different chromosomes and away from their targets. In the majority of quartets, SNPs affect the ex pression of the two gene targets independently of one another, suggesting a mutually independent rather than a directionally dependent effect. Further more, the directions in which the minor allele count of the SNP affects gene expression within quartets are consistent. Same effect eSNPs are observed more often than expected by chance. Cooperating quartets reported here in a human system might correspond to bi fans, a known four nodes network motif previously described in model organisms. Overall, our analysis offers insights concerning the fine motif structure of human regulatory networks.",2014
20847,"Selection constantly filters out genomes with an excess of slightly dele terious variants (SDVs) maintaining the fitness of human population. In case of consanguineous marriages high level of homozygosity, observed in offspring, uncovers the damaging effect of many SDVs variants making the purifying selection more effective. We hypothesize that healthy offspring of consanguineous marriages carry a deficit of these variants as a result of the embryonic selection acting against the high genetic load. Using 50 geno typed pedigrees with consanguineous marriages we revealed a signature of purifying selection. First, by means of modified transmission disequilibrium test we observed a genome wide deficit of rare derived alleles, transmitted from consanguineous parents to their healthy offspring. Because rare deri ved alleles are enriched in deleterious variants we assume, that the deficit of rare derived alleles could be a signature of embryonic purifying selection, which filters out low fitted genomes with high load of mutations. Second, we expect that haplotypes, which are rarely seen in long Runs Of Homozy gosity (ROH) harbor loci with high load of recessive mutations. Comparing the density of slightly deleterious variants inside and outside ROH we pre sent an approach and the first results describing transmission of haplotypes identical by descent in consanguineous marriages. Further investigation of the genetic load of long ROH and the pattern of their inheritance can help to allocate mutations causing recessive autosomal diseases.",2014
20848,"Retinal dystrophies (RD) constitute a group of blinding diseases that show clinical variability and genetic heterogeneity. More than 20 different clinical diagnoses with over 200 genes have been associated with RD. This enor mous heterogeneity is an obstacle to identify disease associated mutations for any diagnostic and research based approach. Next generation sequencing represents the most efficient technology to identify mutations in RD patients and families. In this study, we performed both, panel based sequencing of 105 RD associated genes for diagnostic purposes and exome sequencing for research cases. We developed a diagnostic NGS pipeline to identify mutations in 170 ge netically and clinically unselected RD patients. Underrepresented regions were examined by Sanger sequencing. We found mutations in 50 to 60% of retinitis pigmentosa and approximately 80% of syndromic (Bardet Biedl or Usher syndrome) cases. Seventy one novel mutations in 40 genes were identified, among which the genes USH2A, EYS, ABCA4, and RHO were more frequently affected by pathogenic sequence alterations. Occasionally, cases carried mutations in more than one RD associated gene suggesting modifier effects of the additional variants. We further found possible dominant de novo mutations in sporadic RD cases imposing difficulties for counseling of patients and families. Exome sequencing showed similar detection rates in 11 additional research based RD cases confirming that both approaches are efficient to identify mutations in known disease genes. In contrast to panel sequencing, exome analysis provided the bases to search for gene candida tes for RD. In conclusion, NGS based mutation analyses provide reliable and cost effici ent approaches to investigate genetically heterogeneous diseases like RD.",2014

To overcome the remarkable genetic heterogeneity of HHL an extremely po werful 3 steps Ã¢ÂÂgene identification strategyÃ¢ÂÂ was designed. STEP1 consists in a screening of 96 HHL genes by targeted re sequencing (TS) on Ion Tor rent PGMÃ¢ÂÂ¢ (3487 amplicons). Positive cases contribute to define an accurate molecular epidemiology picture while negative ones undergo a combination of STEP2 (linkage studies) and STEP3 (whole exome sequencing) or directly STEP3 (depending on pedigree size).Illumina protocols were used for STEP2 and STEP3. Sequencing variants were annotated/filtered according to standard pipelines. This strategy was applied to a first series of 28 Italian and Qatari families. STEP1 characte rized 43% of all families and led to the identification of several novel al leles in known HHL genes (Table1a). STEP2 identified four new HHL loci (Table1b), while STEP3 had already led to the discovery of 2 new genes (BDP1 and TBLY1) and it is in progress in the remaining 14 families. Briefly, p*2625Gluext*11 mutation resulting in an elongation of 11 residues of the BDP1 protein was identified in a recessive family. Bdp1 inner ear expression was confirmed by immunohistochemistry. In a pedigree showing a Y linked pattern, the predicted pathogenic D69V mutation was identified in TBLY1 gene. Functional studies are in progress to confirm its pathogenicity.

20850,"Purpose: Leber congenital amaurosis (LCA) is the leading cause of heredi tary blindness in children. CEP290 encodes a ciliary protein important to photoreceptor connecting cilium assembly and function. The CEP290 in tronic c.2991+1655A>G change is the most common LCA causing mutation (10%). It introduces a cryptic exon in the mRNA encoding a premature ter mination codon. Recently, we made the proof of concept of antisense oligo nucleotides (AON) mediated exon skipping to correct the splicing in patient fibroblasts which recovered ability to ciliate. The purpose of this study was to make the proof of concept of exon skipping in vivo using intravitreal in jections of AONs. Methods: AONs were designed to skip mouse Cep290 exon 36. Variable concentrations of 6 FAM AONs were injected into the vitreous of C57BL/6J mice. Retinal sections and mRNA were prepared during 30 days post injections (dpi) to follow i) the distribution of oligonucleotides across cellular layers and ii) exon skipping efficiency. Results: The most efficient AONs identified by in vitro analyses were injected in the vitreous of animals. Excellent correlation between the efficiency of exon skipping and AON in jected dose has been demonstrated. Histological analyses revealed a wide distribution of AON in all retinal cell layers at least until 30 dpi. A linear amount decrease of mRNA lacking exon 36 was measured but still detectab le at 30 dpi. Conclusion: Here we report that single intravitreal injection of AON allows efficient and persistent exon skipping in retinal cells. Hence, this strategy may be regarded as an attractive alternative to gene replacement therapy for 10 % of patients affected with LCA.",2014
20851,"Inherited optic neuropathy has been ascribed to mutations in mitochondri al fusion/fission dynamic genes, nuclear and mitochondrial DNA encoded respiratory enzyme genes or nuclear genes of poorly known mitochondrial function. On the other hand, enzymopathies of the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA) have been reported to cause severe encephalopathies or isolated re tinitis pigmentosa, but no TCA cycle enzyme deficiency has been hitherto reported in isolated optic neuropathy. Studying a series of five patients with optic atrophy, we found homozygous or compound heterozygous missen se and frameshift mutations in the gene encoding mitochondrial aconitase (ACO2), a TCA cycle enzyme, catalyzing interconversion of citrate into isoci trate. Retrospective studies using patient derived cultured skin fibroblasts revealed various degrees of deficiency in ACO2 activity but also in ACO1 cy tosolic activity. Our study shows that autosomal recessive ACO2 mutations can cause either isolated or syndromic optic neuropathy. This observation supports the view that optic atrophy is a hallmark of defective mitochondri al energy supply and that extra ocular involvement is not related to severity of the enzyme deficiency.",2014
20852,"Foveal hypoplasia, always accompanied by nystagmus, is found as part of the clinical spectrum of various eye disorders such as aniridia, albinism and achromatopsia. However, the molecular basis of isolated autosomal recessi ve foveal hypoplasia is yet unknown. Individuals of apparently unrelated non consanguineous Israeli families of Jewish Indian (Mumbai) ancestry presen ted with isolated foveal hypoplasia associated with congenital nystagmus and reduced visual acuity. Genome wide homozygosity mapping followed by fine mapping defined a 830 Kb disease associated locus (LOD score 3.5). Whole exome sequencing identified a single missense mutation in the ho mozygosity region: c.95T>G, p.(Ile32Ser), in a conserved amino acid within the first predicted transmembrane domain of SLC38A8. The mutation fully segregated with the disease associated phenotype, demonstrating an ~10% carrier rate in Mumbai Jews. SLC38A8 encodes a putative sodium depen dent amino acid/proton antiporter, which we showed to be expressed solely in the eye. Thus, a homozygous SLC38A8 mutation likely underlies isolated foveal hypoplasia. Intracellular localization of SLC38A8 using confocal mi croscopy indicated that SLC38A8 resides within the nuclear envelope and in the Golgi apparatus as well. The sub localization of SLC38A8 is different than that of other SLC38 proteins, as all other members of this family are cytoplasmic transmembrane proteins. This may suggest that SLC38A8 has a different function altogether, and may not be an amino acid transporter as previously predicted. The precise role of SLC38A8 in normal eye develop ment and function, and the molecular mechanisms through which its muta tion causes foveal hypoplasia are yet to be elucidated.",2014
20853,"Geographic barriers limit access to in person cancer genetic services. We conducted a cluster randomized trial with high risk women to test the equivalency and noninferiority of BRCA1/2 telephone counseling to remote in person counseling. 988 women, 25 74 years of age, with a personal or family history of breast and/or ovarian cancer enrolled. Participants were randomized by family unit to either telephone or in person counseling. As sessments were done 1 week following pre test and post test counseling, and at 6 months. Cluster bootstrap methods were used to estimate the 95% confidence interval (CI) for the difference between test uptake proportions. Between group intervention differences in psychosocial outcomes were estimated using linear models together with one sided 97.5% CIs. Telephone BRCA1/2 genetic counseling fulfilled the criteria for noninferiority to in per son remote counseling with regard to anxiety, cancer specific psychological distress, and quality of life measures, as well as assessments of the informa tiveness, interpersonal sensitivity and partnership building of genetic coun selors for both urban and rural dwellers. BRCA1/2 testing uptake was lower following telephone (21.8%) than in person pre test counseling (31.8%) (CI,3.9% 16.3%). However, in person counseling had higher average cost per participant counseled than telephone counseling ($654 vs. $278). The higher uptake of testing in the rural (35.1%) compared to the urban (25.2%) subgroups suggests that the genetic screening interests of rural populations may be underserved by existing health care systems. BRCA1/2 telephone counseling appears to be safe and as effective as in person counseling with regard to minimizing adverse psychological reactions and delivering pati ent centered communication for both rural and urban dwellers.",2014
20854,"The translation of research findings on rare disorders from the laboratory into hospital practice can be challenging. Translation into primary health care is even more problematic due to lack of funding, infrastructure and communication with primary care staff. Through funding specific for disse mination, we have been able to engage with healthcare professionals (HCPs) using a multi faceted approach. We developed a microsite (http://www.ucd.ie/medicine/rare diseases/), animation videos, guidelines handbook, Bioin formatics course and four nation wide educational seminars. The animation videos were designed for HCPs to help explain inheritance patterns and to educate about consanguinity. These graphical educational tools are being used by HCPs to overcome poor literacy in some families. We liaised with HCPs to develop a guidelines handbook to help with the management of common genetic disorders at a local level. We produced a series of common clinical scenarios that HCPs might encounter to help with advising on relative risk and genetic testing procedures. The two day Cli nical Bioinformatics course aimed to update our laboratory staff to enable translation of our research findings into our local diagnostic laboratory. Our educational seminars covered topics such as carrier testing, intellec tual disability, consanguinity, rare disease research and the role of advoca cy. Discussions with seminar attendees suggest that there is a significant knowledge deficit when it comes to genetics in healthcare. However, encou ragingly, HCPs voiced an overwhelming interest in gaining more knowledge about genetics and its application to their practice. We plan to continue our efforts and develop eLearning tools to support the integration of genetics into mainstream medicine.",2014
20855,"Mutations in SCN5A are associated with Brugada syndrome, LQTS, atrial fi brillation and other conditions with risk of sudden cardiac death. Evidence based guidelines exist to significantly improve or avert the mortality and morbidity associated with these conditions. As such the ACMG included SC N5A on its list of incidental findings which it recommends should be retur ned as part of all whole exome/genome sequencing tests. We outline three challenges faced in the return of unanticipated SCN5A variants: (1) Defining pathogenicity in the presence of reduced penetrance and a highly heteroge neous grouping of conditions; (2) Balancing potential psychosocial harm to patient/family with result disclosure vs. possible medicolegal ramifications of not reporting this type of results; and (3) Psychosocial impact of a risk for sudden cardiac death in the absence of a personal or family history context. Through the NCGENES whole exome sequencing study, these challenges are being explored in a cohort of ~500 patients. Incidental, medically actionable findings are reported and this is emphasized during the pre test counseling. We present here our experience with incidental finding of SCN5A mutations detected in 8 of 145 (5.5%) participants. Each variant, previously reported as pathogenic, was independently reviewed and discussed with members of the molecular analysis team to reach consensus regarding interpretation of its pathogenicity. Upon review we determined there was convincing evi dence for only one to be considered pathogenic and reported. The remaining were not reported, though future information may change the assessment of these interpretations.",2014

Methods: We initiated a Ã¢ÂÂgenomic educationÃ¢ÂÂ program for the purpose of providing physicians from different medical fields advanced knowledge in genomic medicine . We emphasized the main take home messages for physicians, defined as: risk calculation for various genetic diseases, recognition of the mode of inheritance from the pedigree, guidelines for decision making on which molecular tests to use, interpretation of test results and their clinical implications. Results: To date, 82 physicians have participated in 6 courses of our Ã¢ÂÂgenomic edu cationÃ¢ÂÂ program, which included lectures, workshops and guided tours in genetic laboratories. In the Ã¢ÂÂpre courseÃ¢ÂÂ examination the average score was 56% (range 20% 80%), whereas in the Ã¢ÂÂpost courseÃ¢ÂÂ examination it was 79% (range 40% 100%).

20858,"Body weight and fat distribution measures are associated with increased risk of cardiometabolic disease. As part of the UK10K study, we have investigated the genetic architecture of anthropometric traits in 3,538 individuals with 6.5x whole genome sequence (WGS) data from the ALSPAC and TwinsUK cohorts. Variants discovered through WGS, along with those from the 1000 Genomes Project (1KGP), were imputed into additional individuals from the ALSPAC and TwinsUK cohorts with GWAS data (total sample size 9,979). We investigated association between anthropometric traits and 8.6 million low frequency and common variants (MAF>0.01). We are in the process of obtai ning in silico replication of prioritised signals. In interim replication analysis across ~15,000 samples, 43 out of 66 novel signals for BMI have the same direction of effect in the replication cohorts (p value,0.0093). We examined the concordance of the direction of effect at established loci for each trait. Out of the 31 established independent loci for BMI that were present in our data, 28 have the same direction of effect (p value,2.3e 06). For weight, 10 out of 11 known loci (p value,0.006), and for height 151 out of 172 loci (p value<2.2e 16) have the same direction of effect, respectively. We estimated the improvement in genome wide signal captured relative to those present in HapMap 2, HapMap 3 or 1KGP . We find no appreciable increase in variance explained as density increases, suggesting that the contribution of variants with MAF>0.01 are likely to be well captured by existing GWAS implementa tion.

20859,"Genome wide association studies (GWAS) of quantitative electrocardiogra phic (ECG) traits in large consortia identified over 50 loci associated with QRS, RR, QT and PR intervals, with even more loci discovered in ongoing HapMap based meta analyses in larger sample sizes. We hypothesized that imputation from sequencing based reference panels may help in identifying new loci as the contribution of lower frequency variation has not yet been extensively characterized. In the current study, we meta analyzed GWAS re sults from 30,000 samples on the QRS, RR, QT and PR intervals after impu ting 19 million SNPs from the Genome of the Netherlands (GoNL) reference panel (998 unique haplotypes). This approach proved successful; in additi on to many known loci, we identified seven novel locus trait associations. Of the seven novel loci, three were for PR, three were for QT and one was for QRS. Two were novel trait/locus combinations for loci previously observed for other ECG traits. Several others are involved in ion handling crucial to cardiac electrophysiology. The dense coverage of the genome (~seven times more SNPs than HapMap based studies) also enabled us to study known loci in much finer detail. In conclusion, we show that larger reference panels with more accurate haplotype estimates and denser SNP data enable us to find new loci and fine map previously known ones.",2014
20860,"Salt perception and genetic variation in taste receptors may be important determinants of individual differences in salt intake, which in turn repre sents a risk factor for the development of hypertension and cardiovascular diseases. Genetic variations in taste perception are well known for bitter, sweet and umami taste, while little is known on the genetic bases of human salt perception. To investigate this area, salt taste responses were collected on ~ 900 healthy adults coming from 6 different small villages from North Eastern Italy. NaCl taste intensity was assessed with the labelled magnitu de scale (LMS) using a concentration of 1M and the log10 of the intensity ratings were used for the analysis. Genotyping data were imputed to the 1000G SNP set and used to perform a GWAS of salt perception including sex and age as covariates. A significant association with rs547916 SNP (p value,5.6x10 08), closely located to the KCNA5 gene, was detected. A re plication analysis was carried out on an American cohort confirming the association with salt liking phenotype (p value,0.002). KCNA5 encodes a member of potassium channel voltage gated, shaker related subfamily and belongs to the delayed rectifier K+ (DRK) channels that in the mammalian taste system play a central role in specific taste transduction pathways. A study has also shown that KCNA5 is the major functional DRK channel ex pressed in the in rat taste buds. Further experiments are needed to better clarify KCNA5 role in salt perception and liking and possible implications for cardiovascular diseases.",2014

Comprehensive DNase I hypersensitive site (DHS) mapping by the ENCO DE project identified all classes of cis regulatory elements. Recent studies showed enrichment of complex trait GWAS noncoding hits in DHS. However, GWAS hits only partially explain complex trait heritability. The discovery of rare variants located in regulatory regions specific to immune cells should explain part of this heritability. Our approach combines selective DNA cap ture of relevant regulatory regions coupled to next generation sequencing. Genome wide DHS mapping data from the ENCODE and NIH Roadmap Epi genomics Projects were used to select regulatory regions of immune cells. We designed a custom DNA capture panel (Roche SeqCap EZ developer) to target these selected regions, as well as exonic and HLA regions. Captu red DNA (163Mb) is indexed (5 fold per lane) for sequencing on Illumina HiSeq2000 system, yielding average coverage of ~28x. We first applied the Ã¢ÂÂImmunoseq.Ã¢ÂÂ assay to 30 healthy individuals from Sweden (Uppsala BioRe source), where we have existing transcriptome, methylome and ChIP seq data from three primary immune cells (monocytes, B cells and T cells). The capture panel was also applied to 150 trios from the SaguenayÃ¢ÂÂLac Saint Jean asthma familial collection (complex trait with immune and inflamm atory components). We observe an enrichment of variants in the vicinity of allelicly differentially expressed genes (p<1e 10) as well as potential impact of rare conserved variants on allelic differential expression of ge nes (p<0.05). This highlights the 1) potential impact of rare variations on functional mechanism in immune cells and 2) power of our targeted capture approach to identify novel rare variants in regulatory regions.",2014
20862,"To identify coding variants associated with fasting glucose (FG) and fasting insulin (FI) levels, we analysed exome array data in up to 33,407 non diabe tic individuals of European ancestry. We identified multiple glucose lowe ring coding variants in G6PC2, which resides in an established FG genome wide association study (GWAS) locus. Conditional single variant association analysis established the presence of two coding variants at exome wide significance (P<5x10 7) in this gene, one common (PCOND,7.1x10 10, 48.1% MAF, p. V219L) and one rare (PCOND,1.3x10 11, 0.8% MAF, p. H177Y), both were independent of the GWAS SNP at this locus and of each other (PV219L COND on H177Y,4.0x10 7 and PH177Y COND on V219L,3.7x10 10). Gene based analysis (PSKAT,8x10 10) highlighted another coding variant p. Y207S (MAF,0.5%) with evidence of association with FG. In vitro studies of these G6PC2 vari ants showed a reduction in protein expression by 98% (p. H177Y, p<0.001), 100% (p. Y207S, p<0.001) and 43% (p. V219L, p<0.01) compared to wild type in HEK293 cells, with similar results in INS1E cells. Protein expression was rescued with a proteasome inhibitor implying degradation of unstable G6PC2 proteins via the ubiquitin proteasome pathway. Expressed variant proteins localized as expected to the endoplasmic reticulum. We also iden tified two genes not mapping to previously reported GWAS loci in which coding variants were associated with FG (GLP1R : P,4.4x10 7, 1.6% MAF, p. A316T) or FI (URB2: P,3.8x10 7, 0.1% MAF, p. E594V). These data establish a functional role for G6PC2 in FG homeostasis and identify novel glycaemic trait loci. They do not support a role for low frequency or rare coding vari ants in explaining previously reported association signals at GWAS loci.",2014
20863,"There are now over 163 loci associated with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) susceptibility in European populations, though little is known about their contribution to disease risk in non European populations. Using the custom Immunochip array, we genotyped 9,846 individuals of East Asian (Japan, South Korea, Hong Kong, China and UK individuals of East Asian descent), Indian and Indo European (Iranian) descent. Combining these with the existing cohort of 81,248 individuals of European descent (Jostins et al. Nature 2012), we identified 14 novel IBD susceptibility loci at genome wide significance (P<5ÃÂ10 8). The majority of IBD risk loci were shared bet ween both Europeans and non Europeans, and differences in the amount of variance explained in disease liability at each locus were driven by a combi nation of differences in allele frequencies and effect sizes. For instance, the variance in CrohnÃ¢ÂÂs disease (CD) liability explained by four independent risk variants at TNFSF15 was 19 times greater in East Asians than Europeans, a reflection of the risk increasing alleles being more common and having lar ger odds ratios in East Asians. Aggregation of all SNPs assayed on the Immu nochip revealed significant genetic correlation (0.4 0.85) for IBD between European and non European populations. Together, this study increases the total number of IBD susceptibility loci to 177 and demonstrates the perva sive sharing of genetic risk factors across populations, though there exists heterogeneity in the variance explained per locus.",2014
20864,"BAP31 is one of the most abundant proteins of the membrane of the en doplasmic reticulum (ER). It is a chaperone protein involved in several pathways, including ER associated protein degradation, export of proteins from the ER to the Golgi, and programmed cell death. BAP31 is encoded by the BCAP31 gene located in Xq28. It is highly expressed in neurons. We iden tified loss of function mutations in BCAP31 in seven individuals from three different families and one missense mutation in another fourth family. The se people suffer from intellectual and motor disability, dystonia and senso rineural hearing loss with abnormal white matter. The association of these clinical signs define a new X linked syndrome. In primary fibroblasts from patients, we found that the absence of BCAP31 changed the morphology of the ER and disorganized the Golgi apparatus in a significant proportion of cells. We demonstrated that the constitutive deficiency of BCAP31 did not activate the response to unfolded proteins (UPR) nor triggered cell death. Rather, our data suggest that the absence of BAP31 affects ER and Golgi ap paratus metabolism and that BAP31 plays an important role in ER Golgi ex changes. These results provide a molecular basis for a new Mendelian syn drome and connect intracellular protein trafficking with a severe congenital neurological disorder.",2014
20865,"GeorgeÃ¢ÂÂs Healthcare NHS Trust, Tooting, United Kingdom. The proper development of neuronal circuits during neuromorphogenesis and neuronal network formation is critically dependent on a coordinated and intricate series of molecular and cellular cues and responses. Although the cortical actin cytoskeleton is known to play a key role in neuromorpho genesis, relatively little is known about the specific molecules important for this process. We identified nine affected individuals from four Ohio Amish families affected by an autosomal recessive, variable form of neurodeve lopmental delay. The most consistent features were global developmental delay, macrocephaly, anxiety, and some features suggestive of a pervasive developmental disorder. In addition, a primary seizure disorder was descri bed in three cases. Using a combination of autozygosity mapping, linkage ABSTRACTS CONCURRENT SESSIONS ESHG 2014 | MILAN, ITALY | WWW. ESHG. ORG 39Back to inde x analysis and whole exome sequencing, we demonstrated that two founder mutations in KPTN, encoding kaptin, can result in this phenotype. Our im munofluorescence analyses in primary neuronal cell cultures showed that endogenous and GFP tagged kaptin associates with dynamic actin cyto skeletal structures and that this association is lost upon introduction of the identified mutations. Taken together, our studies have identified kaptin alte rations responsible for this disorder and have defined kaptin as a molecule crucial for normal human neuromorphogenesis. Finally, our identification of two KPTN mutations within this Anabaptist population parallels the si tuation seen for a number of other genes with multiple mutations that also commonly cause inherited diseases globally (e.g., GJB2 mutations in inheri ted hearing loss, and ATM mutations in ataxia telangiectasia), indicating that kaptin neurodevelopmental delay might be similarly widespread.",2014
20866,"Neurodegeneration with brain iron accumulation (NBIA) encompasses a group of rare neurogenerative disorders with different clinical, brain MRI and molecular features, underlined by progressive extrapyramidal dys function and iron accumulation in the brain. To date, mutations in PANK2, PLA2G6, FA2H, ATP13A2, C2orf37, CP , FTL and WDR45 have been associated with NBIA. Nevertheless a large number of individuals have Ã¢ÂÂidiopathic NBIAÃ¢ÂÂ, with unknown etiology. Exome sequencing of two sisters with NBIA identified two heterozygous mutations in the REPS1 gene. REPS1 is involved in endocytosis and the two mutations (p. Ala113Glu and p. Val78Leu) affect its EH1 domain that interacts with RAB11FIP2. Western Blot analysis detec ted a low level of REPS1 in patientÃ¢ÂÂs fibroblasts. The function of REPS1 in iron metabolism is unknown, but it was shown that RABB11 FIP2 functions in transferrin recycling. We investigated the iron metabolism and oxidative stress in patientÃ¢ÂÂs fibroblasts. Patient fibroblasts exhibited a dramatic iron overload, measured by a colorimetric ferrozine based assay. Consistently steady state levels of ferritin, iron responsive protein (IRP1) and SOD2 were increased whereas aconitase activity was decreased. This indicates that REPS1 mutations induce deregulation of iron metabolism. Over expression of the wild type REPS1 cDNA in patientÃ¢ÂÂs cells reduces the iron overload of these cells that display almost normal iron content. Our experiments de monstrate that REPS1 is a new gene of NBIA. Improvement in our under standing of the biochemistry and pathophysiology of this form of NBIA will help develop novel therapeutics for this neurological condition.",2014

Pseudo TORCH syndrome indicates a group of disorders putatively linked to autoimmunity and is characterized at birth by cerebral calcification, mi crocephaly, enlarged ventricles, cerebellar atrophy and the development of hyperbilirubinemia, thrombocytopenia and hepatomegaly resembling con genital infections. There is overlap with Aicardi GoutiÃÂ¨res syndrome (AGS), caused by mutations in genes involved in RNA catabolism, indirectly leading to increased Interferon type I signalling. We report on patients from two families with pseudo TORCH, cerebral haemorrhage and early demise. The first consanguineous family included 3 affected sibs. Using linkage ana lysis, whole exome sequencing and sanger sequencing of the non covered exons in the linkage area, we identified a homozygous truncating mutation in USP18, causing total absence of USP18 transcript in cultured fibroblasts, compared to normal expression in controls. In the second family, including two sibs, the same truncating mutation in heterozygous form was found. No transcript was amplified from cells of the two patients, suggesting that a second mutation is present in areas not covered by Sanger sequencing. USP18 is an interferon stimulated gene and itself a key regulator of inter feron response both in native antibacterial and antiviral immunity and in autoimmune response. Usp18 knockout mice have cerebral hemorrhage and hydrocephalus with ependymal necrosis. Microscopy of patient brain tissues shows severe ependymal abnormalities, similar to the mouse. In conclusion, USP18 mutations are a novel genetic cause of pseudo TORCH syndrome and severe cerebral hemorrhage which provide for the first time a direct link between the IFN type I signalling pathway and the disease phe notype.",2014
20868,"Cytogenetically visible chromosomal translocations are a unique resour ce as they can pinpoint strong effect genes. Here we report a mother and daughter with borderline intelligence and learning problems within the dyslexia spectrum and two apparently balanced reciprocal translocations; t(1;8)(p22;q24),t(5;18)(p15;q11). By low coverage mate pair whole geno me sequencing we were able to pinpoint the genomic breaks to within a 2kb window and the DNA breakpoints were then verified by PCR and Sanger se quencing. The 5p breakpoint was located between exon 7 and 8 of CTNND2. By genome wide array comparative genomic hybridization we identified an additional individual with similar phenotypic presentation and a maternally inherited 163kb microdeletion exclusively involving CTNND2. The micro deletion at 5p11.2 is present as mosaicism in the mother and absent in the patientÃ¢ÂÂs healthy siblings. Inappropriate migration of cortical neurons has been postulated as a poten tial mechanism for various neurological disorders including dyslexia, given the potential role of CTNND2 in neuron motility, we were particularly in terested in assessing defects in neuronal migration in vivo. Knockdown of one of two zebrafish CTNND2 orthologues using antisense morpholino oli gonucleotides showed mostly normal development of the neuronal clusters. However, analysis of a subpopulation of forebrain neurons expressing GFP under the islet promoter (isl:GFP) in knockdown embryos showed the pres ence of misplaced isl:GFP cells between the telencephalon and diencephalon indicative of a defects in migration. This suggests that defective migration of subpopulations of neuronal cells due to loss of CTNND2 could be part of the underlying mechanism behind the cognitive dysfunction in the patients.",2014

Methods: Independent exome sequencing studies were performed in two unrelated patients with a novel leukoencephalopathy. MRI findings in these patients were compared to MRIs in a database of unclassified leukoencepha lopathies. Eleven additional patients with similar MRI abnormalities were selected. Clinical and MRI findings were investigated. ABSTRACTS CONCURRENT SESSIONS ESHG 2014 | MILAN, ITALY | WWW. ESHG.

Functional studies in yeast confirmed the pathogenicity of the mutations in one patient. Sanger sequencing was performed in the eleven additional pati ents and revealed AARS2 mutations in four patients. The in total six patients with AARS2 mutations had childhood to adulthood onset signs of neurolo gical deterioration consisting of ataxia, spasticity and cognitive decline with features of frontal lobe dysfunction. MRIs showed a leukoencephalopathy with involvement of left right connections and ascending and descending tracts, and cerebellar atrophy. All female patients had ovarian failure.

We identified three unrelated patients with recurrent infections, congenital leukopenia including neutropenia, B and T cell lymphopenia, and progression to bone marrow failure. Whole exome sequencing revealed novel, deleterious mu tations in the PGM3 gene in all three subjects, delineating a new type of congenital disorder of glycosylation (CDG). Functional studies of the human immunodeficiency associated PGM3 gene variants in E.coli cells demonstra ted reduced PGM3 enzyme activity with decreased phosphate group trans fer from position GlcNAc 6 P to GlcNAc 1 P . Two of the 3 patients had skel etal anomalies with short stature, brachydactyly, and intellectual disability, however these additional features were absent in the third patient, showing the clinical variability of the disease. Two patients were transplanted using a cord blood hematopoietic stem cell and a matched related donor bone mar row; both had successful engraftment and correction of neutropenia and lymphopenia. We define PGM3 CDG as a novel cause of treatable genetic im munodeficiency, document the power of whole exome sequencing in gene discoveries for rare disorders, and illustrate the utility of genomic analyses in studying combined and variable phenotypes.",2014
20871,"Lenz Majewski syndrome (LMS) constitutes a unique rare disease charac terised by the association of generalised sclerosing bone dysplasia, intel lectual disability, cutis laxa and distinct craniofacial, dental, and distal limb anomalies. By using whole exome sequencing in four patients and selecting variants according to the predicted dominant de novo etiology model, we identified causative heterozygous missense mutations in PTDSS1 gene, which encodes phosphatidylserine synthase 1 (PSS1). Subsequently, three additional patients were screened by Sanger sequencing and similar muta tions were found. In total, five different missense mutations affecting four specific PSS1 amino acids were identified in the seven patients studied to date. PSS1 is one of two enzymes involved in production of phosphatidyl serine. Phosphatidylserine synthesis was increased in patientsÃ¢ÂÂ intact fibro blasts and end product inhibition of PSS1 by phosphatidylserine was signi ficantly reduced. Therefore, these mutations cause a gain of function effect associated with regulatory dysfunction of PSS1. In support of this model, craniofacial defects similar to those found in LMS, were observed following expression of mutant but not wild type PTDSS1 in zebrafish. Interestingly, total phospholipid cellular content was similar between patient and control fibroblasts. Ongoing lipidomic studies suggest that the identified mutations cause abnormal fatty acid composition of individual subclasses of membra ne phospholipids. In conclusion, we have identified LMS as the first human disease caused by disrupted phosphatidylserine metabolism and one of the few examples of gain of function mutations affecting an enzyme. Our results bring important insight to the understanding of phosphatidylserine metabolism and point to an unexplored link with bone development and homeostasis.",2014
20872,"Fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) pathways determine crucial cellular roles for proliferation, migration, fate and survival, by various extracellular and intracellular modes of action. Acidic FGF extracellular action usually consists of binding multiple forms of cell surface receptors, leading to the activation of cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase pathways but it also enters into the nucleus to stimulate DNA synthesis. The acidic fibroblast growth factor intracellu lar binding protein (FIBP) is a FGF1 binding protein widely expressed in human tissues, but its function remains unknown in FGF signaling. We per formed exome sequencing in a 22 year old man, born from healthy consan guineous parents, and presenting with an undefined phenotype associating overgrowth, marfanoid habitus, macrocephaly, facial dysmorphism, large thumbs, bilateral iris coloboma, ventricular septal defect, mitral valve pro lapse, venous insufficiency, moderate scoliosis, and learning disabilities. A homozygous nonsense mutation (p. Gln218*) was identified and was absent in unaffected siblings. FIBP is known to be expressed in brain, eye, heart and kidneys, consistent with the patientÃ¢ÂÂs clinical features. Additional functio nal results argue for the pathogenicity of the mutation in the phenotype: 1) FIBP cDNA was undetectable in patientÃ¢ÂÂs fibroblasts; 2) the intracellular FGF pathway was deregulated with increased FGF 1 protein level; 3) The XTT test and Ki67 labelling exhibited a higher proliferation capacity in patientÃ¢ÂÂs ABSTRACTS CONCURRENT SESSIONS ESHG 2014 | MILAN, ITALY | WWW.

20873,"CdLS is a clinically and genetically heterogeneous developmental disorder. Patients are characterized by distinct facial features, growth retardation and cognitive delay. Whereas half of the patients show mutations in the NIPBL gene, mutations in SMC1A, SMC3, RAD21 or HDAC8 account for additional 10%. Interestingly, recent data using DNA from buccal mucosa (BM) tissue could identify a high proportion of mosaic mutations in NIPBL which were not detected in DNA from blood samples. Here we report on two unrelated patients with characteristic CdLS phenotype, who were mutation negative by Sanger sequencing analyzing DNA from blood and BM samples. Subsequent Ion Torrent panel sequencing on DNA of BM using a custom made Ion AmpliSeq enrichment that includes the five known CdLS genes be side eleven functionally associated candidate genes, could detect a mosaic nonsense (17%) and a mosaic missense mutation (13%) in NIPBL. Intere stingly SNaPshot fragment analyses were able to confirm both mutations in DNA from BM, fibroblasts and urine samples but did not detect these muta tions in DNA from blood. Additional Sanger sequencing approaches using DNA from all four tissues could only detect both mutations in fibroblast DNA. In summary, our data strongly support a high frequency of mosaic NIPBL mutations in CdLS patients. More importantly, it also shows the limitations of current sequencing approaches in diagnostics, even when using DNA of BM as recently suggested. Thus we recommend the use of high coverage se quencing techniques on DNA of BM, especially when analyzing patients with characteristic CdLS phenotypes and negative Sanger sequencing results.",2014

It has been hypothesized that the dysregulation of gene expression by chromatin remodeling likely represents the underlying pa thogenesis of CdLS, however the exact mechanism by which this is effected is unknown. To gain a better understanding of this process we investiga ted whether the gene transcription machinery was somehow affected by SMC1A mutations. We used chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with massively parallel DNA sequencing (ChIP seq) to identify genomic regions co occupied by cohesin, NIPBL and RNA pol II in normal human lympho blastoid cells. Genes co localizing cohesin, NIPBL and RNA pol II have been compared to gene expression data from CdLS cell lines. Finally, we investi gated the recruitment of RNA pol II onto genes differentially expressed in CdLS mutated cells. Our results indicate that SMC1A mutations reduce the recruitment of Pol II at promoter regions and also affect the activity of the Pol II elongating form. These findings highlight the pivotal role of cohesin in transcriptional regulation and the effect on Pol II occupancy may explain the typical gene dysregulation observed in CdLS cell lines.",2014

Muscle biopsy showed ragged red and COX negative fibres with combined respiratory chain deficiency and abnormal assembly of complex V. The multiple mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) deletions found in skeletal muscle revealed a mtDNA instability disorder. By whole exome se quencing (WES), we identified a missense mutation (c.176C>T; p.

We show that CHCHD10 is a mitochon drial protein located in the intermembrane space and enriched at cristae junctions. Patient fibroblasts carrying the CHCHD10 mutation present with a respiratory chain deficiency and a fragmentation of the mitochondrial net work. Furthermore, we show that overexpression of CHCHD10S59L triggers mitochondrial fragmentation in HeLa cells, thus confirming the deleterious effect of this mutant on mitochondrial morphology and network. DRP1 K38A, which is resistant to fission, did not modify the mitochondrial frag mentation observed in cells expressing CHCHD10S59L, suggesting that the CHCHD10 mutant leads to impaired fusion activity.

Mutations in other genes are more frequent, with ACAD9 being the most common finding with more than 15 cases, providing statistical evidence for the association with isolated respiratory chain complex deficiency. More difficult to identify are missense mutation in genes coding orphan proteins such as FBXL4, a protein with unknown function associated with reduced mitochondrial protein content. Additional diagnostic challenges are pati ents with recessive mutations in more than one gene resulting in a com pound clinical phenotype. Evolving topics are tRNA modifying enzymes (ELAC2, MTO1 and GTPBP3) and tRNA synthetases, both involved in the translation of mitochondrial pro teins as well as cofactor metabolism defects.

To that end, LV transduced Tp / Upp / HSCs containing the native cDNA sequence (TP) or codon optimized (TPco) driven by the phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK) or the spleen focus forming virus (SFFV) promoter were transplanted in sublethal ly irradiated Tp / Upp / mice. Wild type mice had detectable but very low levels of enzyme activity in blood cell fractions (0.07 ÃÂ± 0.03nmoles/h/mg, N,4), 1 month post transplantation, enzyme activities increased at least 90 fold in LV recipient mice (LV TP and LV TPco , 150ÃÂ±4 and 96ÃÂ±4 nmoles/h/mg respectively, N,4), with a 400 fold increase observed in recipients of LV SFFV TPco (450ÃÂ±5, N,4), resulting in reduction of Thd and dUrd in plasma and urine. TP activity was detectable in brain of gene therapy treated mice 14 months after treatment (average of 1.2 fold in LV TP and LV TPco compa red to wild type and 36 fold for LV SFFV TPco), which significantly reduced the nucleoside levels. High molecular chimerism (76.5ÃÂ±8.2 % donor chime rism, N,12) with low LV vector copy numbers (1.01ÃÂ±1.1VCN/donor derived cell, N,12)were achieved.

For neonatal diabetes this included a transient subtype and syndromes such as Wolcott Rallison. In this study we investigated the impact of testing all known genetic causes of neonatal diabetes. We studied 1020 patients from 79 countries with diabetes diagnosed <6 months of age. Mutations were identified by targeted next generation se quencing of 21 genes, Sanger sequencing or 6q24 methylation analysis. A pathogenic mutation was identified in 840 patients (82%).

The median age at referral decreased from 271 weeks in 2004 to 18 weeks in 2013. Patients with a genetic diagnosis of Wolcott Rallison syndrome referred <12 months of age were therefore more likely to have isolated diabetes at referral (85% vs 33% >12 months) and develop additio nal features (e.g. liver failure) after testing. A genetic diagnosis also predicts diabetes remission: 88/94 patients (94%) referred <3 months received a genetic diagnosis of transient neonatal diabetes before remission.

This approach allowed targeted multiplex enrichment of 768 DNAs per week per fte, and barcoding allowed simultaneous sequencing of up to 3,072 samples for the 42 gene panel per HiSeq2000 sequencing run.

Trio Exome sequencing was recently proposed as a diagnostic approach, but re mains costly for general implementation. We thus tested targeted exon se quencing of 217 genes previously implicated in X linked ID, or in autosomal dominant or recessive forms in which ID is the major clinical concern. We analyzed 106 patients (mostly males and sporadic cases) with molecularly undiagnosed ID. One third of them harbored autistic features.

We detected likely causative mutations requiring additional validation in 5 patients (in NLGN3 for instance). Our findings confirm MED13L as an ID gene, but raise doubts on SHROOM4 or SRPX2. We identified causative mutations in syndromic ge nes in patients deviating from the classic phenotype. Some genes were hit more than once suggesting they correspond to more frequent conditions.

Following custo mized target enrichment, NGS was performed, followed by bioinformatic analysis. Variants with a global minor allele frequency <5% were selected for evaluation and identified mutations were validated using Sanger se quencing. Results: In our study, over 1000 patients with epileptic disorders were analyzed. 20% of patients had pathogenic mutation(s) and 29% were inconclusive, partly being predicted pathogenic but unknown variants, part ly due to non segregation of identified variants. 51% of the cases remained unsolved. We observed rare variants in 203 different genes, with SCN1A , SC N2A, CACNA1A , MECP2 and KCNT1 being mutated most frequently. Across the cohort, 78 genes were identified as causative only once, emphasizing the advantage of diagnostic panels for very rare conditions. Conclusion: We have developed a highly reliable and cost efficient diagno stic NGS panel to analyze the genetic basis of epilepsies.

20885,"Primary immunodeficiencies (PIDDs) constitute a heterogeneous group of genetic diseases affecting the immune system. Depending on the genetic etiology, symptoms range from mild to severe and life threatening. Know ledge of the molecular genetic cause and disease mechanism is important and can direct targeted and curative therapy. However, subtype classification is difficult as patients often have overlapping phenotypes. In addition, >250 PIDD genes have been reported, and few are offered for diagnostic genetic testing. We examined the utility of whole exome sequencing (WES) to detect single nucleotide variants (SNVs) and copy number variations (CNVs) in the diagnosis of PIDDs. As of Feb 2014, 225 patients with extensive immunolo gical and genetic testing from 200 families have been recruited from Texas Children Hospital (Houston, USA) and Oslo University Hospital (Norway). Strategies for genetic analysis were tailored based on clinical data, immu nophenotyping and family history, but for most families only the proband was subjected to WES. Initially, WES data were systematically screened for variants in reported and potential PIDD genes. In addition, a computational CNV prediction pipeline was applied to enable identification of potential disease causing CNVs from the WES data. Analysis of the first 110 families identified PIDD relevant variants in 60% of cases; half of these attaining a definitive molecular PIDD diagnosis. The other half had previously reported PIDD causing variants, but with an unexpected or extended clinical pheno type, or heterozygote, potential deleterious variants in recessively inherited PIDD genes. Other interesting findings include PIDD causing CNVs, somatic reversion causing mosaicism, and 13 potential novel disease genes.",2014
20886,"Autosomal dominant tubulo interstitial kidney disease refers to a group of disorders characterized by progressive loss of kidney function and the eventual need for dialysis and kidney transplantation. While mutations in the UMOD, MUC1, and REN genes have been identified as the primary cau ses of this disorder, there remain a number of families in whom the gene tic cause has not been identified. Here we report a three generation family with autosomal dominant progressive chronic kidney disease associated with congenital anemia and intrauterine growth retardation. Ultrasound examinations revealed small dysplastic kidneys without cysts, and a kidney biopsy revealed tubular atrophy with secondary glomerular sclerosis. We performed genome wide linkage analysis and identified a candidate region with a maximum LOD score of 2.7 on chromosome 3q. Combining whole exome sequencing data with our critical interval, we identified a c.553A>G variant causing a p. Thr185Ala change in SEC61A1. SEC61A1 encodes the alpha subunit of the SEC61 complex, responsible for the translocation of proteins across the endoplasmic reticulum membrane. Suppression of se ABSTRACTS CONCURRENT SESSIONS ESHG 2014 | MILAN, ITALY | WWW. ESHG. ORG 45Back to inde x c61a1 in zebrafish embryos led to an absence of convolution of the prone phric tubules, whereas the pronephric ducts were unaffected, a phenotype similar to the tubular atrophy seen in our patients. This phenotype could be rescued by wild type SEC61A1 mRNA, but not with mRNA encoded from the p. Thr185Ala allele, suggesting that the variant is a loss of function. Taken to gether, our genetic findings and the functional studies support SEC61A1 as a causal gene for a novel, dominant syndromic form of progressive chronic kidney disease with tubular atrophy.",2014
20887,"Progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis (PFIC) is an autosomal reces sive disorder manifesting as early onset cholestatic liver disease. In 1998 mutations in three genes encoding membrane transporters were identified. However, 30% of patients remain without genetic diagnosis. Combined targeted resequencing (TRS) and whole exome sequencing were used to analyse a cohort of 33 children, from 29 families, with chronic cholestatic liver disease and no mutations in known PFIC genes. Most were from con sanguineous families. Homozygous mutations in TJP2 were identified in 12 individuals of 8 families; all were predicted to abolish translation. TJP2 encodes a cytosolic component of cell cell junctional structures, linking integral membrane proteins such as claudins with actin filaments. Immu nohistochemistry and western blotting of liver tissue from these patients showed a complete absence of TJP2 protein. Claudin 1 was not localised, but showed no alteration in protein level. Tight junctions were abnormal on transmission electron microscopy. A further 53 cholestatic patients were then examined by TRS. Mutations in TJP2 were identified in 8 families. All mutations were protein truncating mutations, except for three families with missense mutations. One missense mutation, p. His788Leu, was found in 2 unrelated families with severe early onset cholestasis, which subsequently remitted. Previously a single, incompletely penetrant, missense mutation was identified in TJP2 in Amish patients with isolated hypercholanaemia. In conclusion, a complete absence of TJP2 causes severe cholestatic liver disea se, with destabilization of tight junction structures, whilst missense mutati ons in TJP2 can lead to less severe phenotypes. These findings highlight the importance of TJP2 in the maintenance of liver integrity.",2014
20888,"Disorders of sex development (DSDs) are congenital conditions with atypical development of chromosomal, gonadal or anatomical sex. The prevalence of these conditions is 1 in 4500, milder genital abnormalities are seen in 1 in 300 births. Today, the molecular cause is known in only 50% of cases. Here, homozygosity mapping in a patient with syndromic 46,XY DSD re vealed a potential functional candidate gene for DSD, namely ESR2 , encoding the Estrogen Receptor beta. Sanger sequencing revealed a homozygous in frame deletion in ESR2 in this patient, c.541_543del (p. Asn181del). The de leted amino acid is located in the DNA binding domain and is highly conser ved. This deletion was absent in an ethnically matched control population. ESR2 mutation screening in a 46,XY DSD cohort revealed an additional hete rozygous mutation c.251G>T (p. Gly84Val). Prediction programs suggest an effect on protein function (SIFT , Polyhen, Mutation Taster). In addition the affected amino acid is conserved until fruitfly. Immunohistochemistry in an 8 weeks old human male embryo showed ER beta expression in the hindgut and the eyes, which might recapitulate the systemic manifestations of the index case. Dose response assays with DPN, ERE luc and TK 3xEREluc constructs, and ER beta wild type and mutant constructs in HEK293T cells showed a diffe rential transcriptional activation of the ER beta mutants. In conclusion, our study sustains a role of ESR2 as novel disease gene for syndromic 46,XY DSD. It is expected that further functional studies of these ER beta mutants will provide insights into their molecular consequences and into the role of ESR2 in the pathogenesis of 46,XY DSD.",2014
20889,"Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is a Mendelian disorder characterized by multiple renal cysts that progressively leads to renal disease. Polycystic livers are the most common extra renal manifesta tion (83%). About 90% of ADPKD families harbor a PKD1 or PKD2 mutation, but others remain indistinct. Previous studies hypothesized involvement of a third locus. Recently, we identified mutations in a novel gene (LRP5 ) asso ciated with isolated polycystic liver disease (PCLD).We analyzed all exons of LRP5 in a cohort of 29 patients with and 50 patients without prescreening of PKD1/2 and PKHD1 . We identified 2 novel and 2 rare variants in 4 unlinked ADPKD patients. One family demonstrated ob vious segregation of the novel LRP5 variant with the disease. In silico analyses predicted both novel and 1 rare LRP5 variant to be patho genic, and the remaining variant as possibly damaging. All 4 variants were not found in exome data from 1,300 individuals of predominantly European ancestry sequenced in house. The 2 novel LRP5 variants were absent in se veral (inter)national databases and also excluded in a control set of 1,000 Dutch and 525 Moroccan DNAs of healthy, unrelated individuals. For 3 mutations homology modeling predicted that ionic interactions dis appear which diminishes the protein domain function. Luciferase activity assays were performed in eukaryotic cells transfected with wild type and mutant LRP5. Wnt signal activation was significantly reduced in 2 novel and 1 rare LRP5 variant. In conclusion, these findings contribute to the pathofysiology of renal and hepatic cystogenesis with involvement of the canonical Wnt signaling pa thway.",2014

The increased availability of high throughput sequencing permits identification of kindreds with pathogenic mutations in more than one disease gene, also exploring digenic inheritance models. We have found 6 kindreds, in which the proband had 2 pathogenic mutations in different Alport associated genes. In 4 out of 6 cases it was shown that each ABSTRACTS CONCURRENT SESSIONS ESHG 2014 | MILAN, ITALY | WWW. ESHG. ORG 46Back to inde x mutation was inherited from one of the parents. In most cases heterozygo tes had less severe disease than the double heterozygotes. In two cases mu tations involved the COL4A5 and COL4A4 genes, whereas in the remaining 4, mutations involved the COL4A3 and COL4A4 genes. Mutation pathogenicity was ascertained on the basis of the following criteria: non polymorphic mis sense mutations in key aminoacids, as Glycine in the collagen Gly X Y triple helical domain, or truncating mutations. In conclusion, results from new technologies showed that some cases of ATS may segregate according to a digenic inheritance model. This model has previously been shown in other diseases, such as retinopathies, cardiomyopathies or intellectual disability. Our results are of interest both from a scientific point of view and for genetic counselling. Clinical geneticists should be familiar with more complex mo dels of inheritance, which could alter the recurrence risk.",2014
20891,"Trisomy 21 is a model disorder of altered gene expression. Several studies have addressed the transcriptome differences between normal and affected individuals; however all of these studies suffer from the presence of Ã¢ÂÂnoiseÃ¢ÂÂ due to gene expression variation among different individuals. We have pre viously used a pair of monozygotic twins discordant for trisomy 21 in order to study the global dysregulation of gene expression (Nature in press 2014). The majority of previous studies focused on aneuploidies were conducted ÃÂ¿n cultured cell populations or tissues, but studies focusing on gene and al lelic expression behavior at the single cell level are lacking. In this study we explore the allele specific expression in Trisomy 21 using transcriptome studies in single cells. We have used 40 normal cells and 48 trisomic cells from the fibroblasts of the monozygotic twins discordant for trisomy 21 and compared the ASE (allele specific expression), and their transcriptional me trics in these two cell groups. We observed a pattern of biased or monoalle lic expression for the majority of the genes across single cells. These results will be presented and discussed. In addition a series of samples from mosaic trisomy 21, trisomy 13 and trisomy 18 are in different stages of investigati on.

20892,", Mountain View, CA, United States, 5Department of Clinical Genetics, Maastricht University Medical Centre, Maastricht, Netherlands. De novo germline mutations create the genetic variability that is the driving force of species evolution. However, they also can cause sporadic genetic diseases if they affect critical genomic regions. Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS) of parent offspring trios allows us for the first time to study the re sult of mutational processes in a single generation in full detail. Here we report on the rate and pattern of de novo mutations based on WGS of 50 trios at high (80x median) coverage. We identified an average of 58 de novo mutations (DNM) per trio (range 32 84), 2,883 DNMs in total. By using the segregation of informative SNPs we determined the parental origin for 678 DNMs, and found a paternal/ma ternal ratio of 4 to 1 (79%/21%), consistent with previous data. Using the parental origin of these DNMs we found a significant correlation between the paternal age and the number of paternal DNMs (SpearmanÃ¢ÂÂs p,0.006) as well as a suggestive results for the correlation between maternal age and the number of maternal DNMs (p,0.08).We find that DNMs do not occur completely random in the genome, but are spatially clustered within individuals (observed,28 (0.9%), expected,1.3 (0.004%), p value<10 16) and have a sequence context that is enriched for CpGs (observed,482 (20.6%), expected,58 (2.6%), p value<10 16).

20893,"Leri Weill Dyschondrosteosis (LWD) and idiopathic short stature (ISS) are caused by a variety of molecular defects of SHOX and the downstream PAR1 region. Interestingly, the first deletion and duplication of the upstream re gulatory PAR1 region have recently been described in ISS, suggesting a new pathogenic mechanism for ISS. Here, we aimed to evaluate the contribution of copy number variations (CNVs) of upstream enhancers to the molecular pathogenesis of LWD and ISS, and to characterize the chromosomal archi tecture of the regulatory landscape of SHOX. We performed CNV analysis of three previously characterized upstream enhancers (CNE 5, CNE 3 and CNE 2) using quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) analysis in 503 prescreened LWD and ISS patients with unknown molecular diagnosis. Three deletions and three enhancer dupli cations were found in five unrelated ISS patients respectively. Interestingly, their shortest region of overlap only contains CNE 3, pointing to a crucial role for this upstream enhancer. Using chromosome conformation captu re assays (3C and 4C seq), we demonstrated reproducible interactions of CNE 3 with the SHOX promoter. Finally, the 4C seq study allowed us to map the complete regulatory landscape of SHOX, extending more than 1 Mb both upstream and downstream of the SHOX promoter. In conclusion, our study substantiates a role of upstream CNVs in ISS pati ents. In addition, we provided evidence for a key role of CNE 3 as upstream enhancer. Finally, our study indicates an important role for the extended regulatory region of SHOX to be included in molecular diagnostics of SHOX associated phenotypes.",2014
20894,"The human sex chromosomes differ in sequence, except for the pseudoau tosomal regions (PAR) at both the short and the long arm, denoted as PAR1 and PAR2. The boundary between PAR1 and the unique X and Y sequences was established during the divergence of the great apes. During a copy num ber variation screen, we noted a paternally inherited chromosome X dupli cation in 15 independent families. Subsequent genomic analysis demon strated that an insertional translocation of X chromosomal sequence into the Y chromosome generates an extended PAR. The insertion is generated by non allelic homologous recombination between a 548 bp LTR6B repeat with two paralogues located within PAR1 as well as at a distance of 105 kb from the PAR boundary on the X chromosome. The identification of the reciprocal deletion on the X chromosome in one family and the occurrence of the variant in different chromosome Y haplogroups, demonstrate this is a recurrent genomic rearrangement. In contrast to its perceived evolutiona ry stability, we demonstrate that a PAR1 length polymorphism exists in the human population. This finding represents a novel mechanism shaping sex chromosomal evolution.",2014

We have already characterized rare individuals of normal intelligence with CGG expansion over 200 repeats without DNA methylation (unmethylated full mutation, UFM), which have relatively normal transcrip tion and translation, and represent the status of FXS cell lines prior to gene silencing. We have compared the three types of cell lines (normal control WT , FXS and UFM fibroblasts) with a proteomic approach in order to de monstrate possible differences that might clarify the mechanisms through which the rare UFM cells remain unmethylated and transcriptionally active. Protein extracts were compared by LC ESI LTQ Orbitrap MS/MS analysis after mono dimensional SDS PAGE and trypsin digestion. Interrogation of the dataset for differential protein expression shows that some metabolic pathways are deregulated in UFM cells when compared to FXS cells. Among these pathways, mitochondrial metabolism (oxidative stress) is of particular interest considering its role in neurodegenerative diseases (like FXTAS) and particularly in epigenetic regulation. The deregulated proteins, specifically mitochondrial SOD (SOD2), were validated by Western blot. The interaction of target mRNAs with FMRP was assessed by RNA immunoprecipitation. Preliminary data suggest that mitochondrial metabolism is likely to have a role in DNA hypomethylation of UFM cell lines.

20896,"The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is an organelle where proteins are synthe sized and modified. ER stress occurs when there is an excess of misfolded proteins, and if the stress persists, then apoptosis is induced. Here we stu dy RNA editing as a part of the ER stress response and how RNA editing modulates the cellular response to promote cell survival. We sequenced the RNA and DNA of B cells from 10 individuals before and following 2 and 8 hours of tunicamycin treatment to induce ER stress. By comparing the RNA and DNA sequences, we identified 15,823 A to G editing sites in 1,523 genes as targets of RNA editing by ADAR (Adenosine Deaminase Acting on RNA). Among these sites, 314 showed significant changes in editing level following ER stress (p value<0.01; ANOVA). These sites are found in genes known to be involved in ER stress response: RNA processing, protein transport and apoptosis. For example, sites found in XIAP (X linked Inhibitor of Apoptosis ) show a 3 fold increase in editing level. Furthermore, ADAR knock down in creases apoptosis following ER stress, suggesting that RNA editing is indu ced to promote cell survival. The effect of ER stress on editing level is not limited to canonical ADAR editing, as we also detected other types of diffe rences between the RNA and DNA sequences whose levels change following tunicamycin treatment. In this presentation, we will describe RNA sequence modification as a critical step in ER stress response and cell survival.",2014

We previously identified loss of function mutations in KRT5 in fewer than half of the indi viduals of our DDD cohort. We undertook an exome sequencing approach to identify additional gene tic causes of DDD by focusing on five unrelated affected individuals without KRT5 mutations. Data analysis revealed three heterozygous mutations (c.11G>A (p. Trp4*), c.652C>T (p. Arg218*), c.798 2A>C) in these five indivi duals, all of which are in POGLUT1, encoding protein O glucosyltransferase 1. By further screening of POGLUT1 in our unexplained cases of DDD, we identified six additional mutations. Immunohistochemistry of skin biop sies of affected individuals with POGLUT1 mutations showed significantly weaker POGLUT1 staining in the upper parts of the epidermis compared to healthy controls. Immunoblot analysis revealed that translation of the wild type POGLUT1 and a mutated form with an amino acid substitution led to the expected size of about 50 kDa, while a nonsense mutation led to a trun cated protein of about 30 kDa. Immunofluorescence analysis identified a co localization of the wild type protein with the endoplasmic reticulum and a notable aggregating pattern for the truncated protein. Protein modeling and transcript analysis supported the pathogenicity of the identified mutations. Recently, mutations in POFUT1, encoding protein O fucosyltransferase 1, were also reported to be responsible for DDD. Both POGLUT1 and POFUT1 are essential regulators of Notch activity.

The disorder is characterized by facial features resembling Noonan syndrome, short stature, GH deficit, developmental delay, congenital cardiac defects, and a distinctive hair phenotype characterized by easily pluckable, slow growing hair in anagen phase. We report on a large cohort of patients with molecularly confirmed diagno sis from an international research collaboration. In all patients, the c.4A>G change was invariably identified. Clinical data from a total of 89 patients (25 previously published) was available. The ages ranged from 0.08 39 years (median at 9.0 years). Short stature and an intellectual disability were present in most of the patients, and were more common than in patients with PTPN11 , SOS1 or RAF1 mutations. Proven growth hormone deficiency was diagnosed in 42% of patients with known test results. SHOC2 muta tion positive individuals also have a recognizable facial phenotype. Heart defects were common, but differently distributed compared to patients with mutations in other RASopathy genes. Multiple defects were documented in 51% of cases.

Loss of function mutations in PAK3 contribute to non syndromic X linked in tellectual disability (NS XLID) by affecting dendritic spine density and mor phology. Linkage analysis in a three generation family with affected males showing intellectual disability, agenesis of corpus callosum, cerebellar hy poplasia, microcephaly and ichthyosis, revealed a candidate disease locus in Xq21.33q24 encompassing over 280 genes. By sequencing all coding exons of the X chromosome, we identified a single novel variant within the linkage region, affecting a conserved codon of PAK3 . Biochemical studies showed that, similar to NS XLID associated lesions, the predicted amino acid substi tution (Lys389Asn) abolished the kinase activity of PAK3. In addition, it con ferred a dominant negative function to the protein that drives the syndromic phenotype. The in silico tridimensional model of the mutated proteins and in vitro inhibition of protein neosynthesis by cycloheximide treatment re vealed that NS XLID mutations make the inactive kinase unstable and prone to degradation, while Lys389Asn confers stability to PAK3 protein, which escapes its physiologic degradation. Finally, in vivo studies in zebrafish em bryos showed that PAK3 N389 leads to a perturbation of the MAPK signaling and to alterations of cerebral and craniofacial structures, through an uncon trolled kinase independent function. Our data expand the spectrum of phe notypes associated with PAK3 mutations, characterize a novel mechanism resulting in a dual molecular effect of the same mutation with a complex PAK3 functional deregulation, and provide evidence for a direct functional impact of aberrant PAK3 function on MAPK signaling, with the generation of a phenotype that could be included within the clinical spectrum of Ras opathies.",2014

CS patients present also laxity of small joints, tight Achilles tendons, cardiac malformations, and developmental delay. The primary cau se of CS was associated to the germ line activation of H Ras oncogene, with a common missense mutation G12S in 80% of the patients. Here we describe the generation and the consequent phenotypic characterization of a gene tically engineered mouse model of CS, by introducing the oncogenic G12S mutation by homologous recombination into the mouse Ras gene. The effect of the H Ras G12S mutation was evaluated on behavioral, visual, metabolic, cardiac and histological traits in young adult animals. The behavioral ana lysis revealed that H Ras G12S mutant males displayed reduced locomotor activity, accompanied by decreased muscle strength and altered motor coor dination performance.

Conclusion: Our model correctly explains observed rates of diagnostic fin dings. Key drivers of rates include diagnostic criteria, variant frequency, disease penetrance, and sequencing and bioinformatics accuracy. Rates of IFs are relatively insensitive to even large increases in the number of condi tions included, but rates of genetic carriers are very sensitive to the number of conditions tested.

Second, the childÃ¢ÂÂs right to an open future principle that urges physicians not to test for adult onset disorders and carrier status, in or der to preserve the childÃ¢ÂÂs future autonomy right to make its own decisions, also concerning the possible obtainment of genetic information.

Many geneticists nevertheless consider it desirable to recontact patients when important new information arises. The UMCG (Groningen, NL) is investigating whether to develop a recontacting system in clinical genetics and how one could be implemented. We explored how professionals and patients from our univer sity hospital feel on these two issues. We organised a focus group discussion with 12 professionals (clinicians, clinical geneticists and laboratory staff) and two group discussions with 3 and 5 patients, respectively, in which we discussed the desirability and requirements for successfully implementing recontacting. Both professionals and patients agreed that recontacting is desirable and implementation could be successful if the following require ments are met: (1) provide a guideline describing the responsibilities of molecular geneticists, genetic counsellors, and patients. This would also specify what information requires recontacting, which information should be given priority, and how recontacting should take place; (2) availability of a lab based databank containing up to date genetic information and the possibility to automatically match new genetic information, e.g. on former variants of unspecified significance, with patients/groups for which the information is important; (3) patientÃ¢ÂÂs preferences regarding recontacting (e.g. what type of information and which recontacting medium to use); (4) development of e health devices facilitating automatic recontacting.",2014
20906,"Whilst genome wide sequencing in a research setting may be used to ex plore the genetic basis of a phenotype it also offers the chance to opportu nistically screen for additional results unrelated to the research project but relevant to the participantsÃ¢ÂÂ future medical health (termed Ã¢ÂÂincidental fin dingsÃ¢ÂÂ, IFs).There is a wealth of medical and ethics literature supporting the feedback of IFs, yet there are limited empirical work offering a voice from both professional and public stakeholders directly affected by this. A cross sectional, web based survey investigated the attitudes of 6944 in dividuals from across 91 countries towards searching for and sharing IFs. Participants included 4961 members of the public, 533 genetic health pro fessionals, 843 non genetic health professionals and 607 genomic resear chers. Eighty percent of participants believed that IFs from sequencing studies should be made available to research participants if they want them. Treata bility and perceived usefulness of the data were important with 98% perso nally interested in learning about life threatening conditions that were pre ventable. However, only 31% of participants thought genomic researchers should actively search for IFs that were not relevant to their research study. Genetic health professionals were the most likely to take this view (OR , 3.09, CI 2.23 4.28, P < 0.0001). This may be due to their appreciation of the complexities involved in translating genomic data in the clinic. Participants felt that genomic researchers should be able to focus on their research que stion without being forced to actively search for IFs, potentially at the ex pense of their study.",2014

The question we focus on is whether the intrinsic persistence in time of ge netic characters (monitored in newborn screening programs), once combi ned both with the rules governing bio banks which store those information and the natural lifelong evolution of personal individuality (from infancy to old age), creates an apparently inextricable set of problems. In this paper we have the ambition simply to draw a list of them in order to open up a space for a public interdisciplinary discussion about new arising challenges that need to be framed and faced by public policies. Some examples are: The complex and not yet unraveled relationship between the gradual evo lution of the interested person and epigenetic developments. Regulations of parentsÃ¢ÂÂ opting in/out screening programs and the chances of modifying their choices during time. The involvement of relatives and future siblings. The (im)possibility of a real opt out during the phase of reconsent. Difficulties arising from the organizational rules of biobanking in relation to the described long lasting process of consent. Privacy issues deriving both from the stable relationship between person and collected data (impossible anonymousness) and the possibility of con trol over informational flows.

First, adopting the cur rent proposal will mean that genetic tests, including both health related and lifestyle tests, will be subjected to a pre market assessment by independent notified bodies. Second, according to the risk class they fall into, IVD devices will have to comply with revised requirements for clinical evidence. Third, the proposal requires appropriate genetic counseling for all genetic tests and classifies them as Ã¢ÂÂprescription onlyÃ¢ÂÂ. Finally, DTC advertising of devices classed as prescription only will be banned.

We analyzed the distribution of 5 hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) and 5 me thylcytosine (5mC) in metaphase chromosomes from IVF produced human triploid zygotes and morphologically abnormal cleavage stage embryos. To obtain metaphase chromosomes, zygotes and embryos were treated with 0.1% colchicines, 0.9% sodium citrate and fixed with freshly prepared 3:1 methanol:acetic acid. Then, QFH/AcD banding technique was applied and cytosine modifications were detected by indirect immunofluorescence. In zygotes, parental sets of chromosomes had reversed patterns of me thylation and hydroxymethylation. Paternal sets, detected by the presence of chromosome Y, contained little 5mC, but were enriched in 5hmC, while maternal chromosomes were heavily methylated and contained little 5hmC. Thus, active demethylation in zygotes involves both parental genomes, but is more intensive in paternal genome. Metaphase chromosomes from zygotes had band specific distribution of 5hmC: R bands, but not G bands and peri centromeric heterochromatin, were enriched with 5hmC. In contrast, 5mC did not demonstrate band specific distribution. In 3 cell embryos, chromo somes with sister chromatids differed both in the levels of 5hmC and 5mC were identified. Number of these asymmetric chromosomes in blastome res decreased with each cleavage division up to the blastocyst stage. At the blastocyst stage asymmetric chromosomes were rarely encountered. This advocates for the replication dependant loss of 5hmC and 5mC. Thus, maternal and paternal chromosomes demonstrate reverse patterns of 5hmC and 5mC at the zygote stage. The number of both methylated and hydroxymethylated chromosomes decrease during cleavage divisions, sug gesting replication dependant loss of modified cytosine.

20910,"Alpha and beta thalassemia and fragile X syndrome (FXS) rank among the most common monogenic disorders globally. Prenatal diagnosis (PND) and pre implantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) of these disorders are usually performed by direct mutation detection. Flanking polymorphic markers provide alternative indirect mutation detection through linkage analysis, or serve to corroborate direct mutation testing results. Currently, limited numbers of linked markers have been optimized and validated for PND/PGD of these diseases. We performed in silico mining to identify 24, 99 and 122 short tandem repeats (STRs) within 1 Mb on either end of the HBA, HBB and FMR1 loci, respectively. Markers with low heterozygosity (HET) and/or polymorphism information content (PIC) after preliminary analysis on 16 anonymous DNAs were dropped, prior to large scale testing on 288 or 480 anonymous DNAs.

The human X chromosome is characterized by genomic instability and rearrangements, associated with various X linked disorders such as mo derate intellectual disability, muscular dystrophies or reduced fertility. In the Laboratory of Medical Genetics that operates as a department of IVF clinic, we are preferentially focusing on fertility connected scope. Here we show two women presenting amenorrhea associated with de novo X chro mosome aberration. First, we report on the case of a 23 year old woman presenting phenotype close to isochromosome i(Xq) with short size and primary oligo amenorrhea. Classical cytogenetic observation revealed a deletion of the chromosomal region Xp11 Xpter. With using FISH, CGH and mBAND methods, de novo duplication in the chromosomal region Xq25q28 was also discovered. As the second case, we describe 30 year old woman who was referred to our IVF clinic because of infertility and amenorrhoea. At the age of 18 years, she was placed on oral contraceptive pills for cycle activation. Now she has been experiencing amenorrhea again and she has been unsuccessful to become pregnant. The cytogenetic analysis revealed de novo deletion in the Xq21.2 qter region. Further analysis by FISH, CGH and mBAND methods led to the revelation of Xp22.31 pter duplication. If we had contented ourselves only with the classical cytogenetic analysis, both cases could be underestimated as simple X chromosome deletions. However, our detailed observations led us to suspect that a complex aberration may be present. These two cases show that conscientious cytogenetic analysis at 550 ISCN bands level in combination with other molecular methods is essential for accurate diagnosis.",2014

AMH levels decreases during repro ductive life, becoming undetectable after the menopause. Serum levels vary broadly by the age of decrease of female fertility (~ 41 years): the discovery of genetic variants responsible for the high variability could be useful to pre dict fertility and age of menopause.

Although the critical region for determining the phenotype is at 4p16.3, the great variability in the extent of the 4p deletion and the possible contribution of additional gene tic rearrangements lead to a wide spectrum of clinical manifestations. Here, we report perinatal diagnosis and molecular cytogenetic characterization of a newborn infant with WHS and partial trisomy of 7p. The patient was a female neonate with facial dysmorphia including ocular hypertelorism, mi crognathia, both preauricular pit, low set ears, and short and stubby fingers. Fetal agenesis of the corpus callosum was suspected by cranial ultrasono graphy. Laboratory analysis showed that she had acute renal failure.

As controls we used 94 ma les from our biobank, who had fathered a child and did not have the abbera tion found in their child on aCGH. The samples were run on Agilent technology array comparative genome hybridization with 180K and 400K resolution according to the manufactu res procedure. 23 patients were run on 180K aCGH against a single sample control, 35 against a multisample control, and 37 patients on a 400K array with multisample control. We found totally 1863 CNVs in the patient group (19.6/patient) and 973 (10.3/patient) in the control group. For patients and controls run with same resolution (180K) we found 9.2 and 10.3 CNVs per patients. The CNVs in the control group were subtracted from the patient group. We also eliminated CNVÃ¢ÂÂs in regions with no known genes. The remaining 154 chromosome regions were checked for CNVÃ¢ÂÂs known for expression or function in testis in the Database of Genomic Variants (DGV). There were no major large chromosome regions common for all patients and no regions earlier described as candidate genes. This left us with 12 new interesting small CNV regions not described before, that might affect male infertility.",2014

We descri be a protocol for non invasive prenatal diagnosis of ÃÂ² thalassemia with a next generation sequencing approach and Ion Torrent technology. Eighteen experiments of NIPD of ÃÂ² thalassemia have been carried in cfDNAs of wo men who underwent PD for ÃÂ² thal. In total, we have amplified and sequen ced 47 amplicons mapping in the beta globinic gene cluster and further 3 amplicons (ZFX/ZFY, SRY and TSPY1) useful to detect fetal sex and fractio nal fetal DNA. In the validation phase we have included the parental DNAs and trophoblast DNA to infer parental haplotypes inherited from the fetus. In the meanwhile we have developed a protocol to infer parental haplotypes without fetal information. The method is based on haplotype selection by allele specific long range PCR (LR PCR) with allele specific primers with the 3Ã¢ÂÂ base complementary to the mutated or to the normal allele for the most common ÃÂ² thalassemia mutations. These reactions were performed with an high fidelity polymerase able to amplify genomic targets extending both downstream and upstream the causative mutations. By this approach, the 69.4% of fetal haplotypes, mainly of paternal origin, has been correctly identified in the cfDNAs processed. Following these encouraging results, we are working in order to improve the performance of our platform by ex tending the analysis to a higher number of SNPs and by developing specific algorithms of analysis.",2014

Mutations have been reported in EBP , which is involved in cholesterol biosynthesis. To date, severe prenatal occurrence has been reported in only 6 females. In order to characterize this severe phenotype, we analyzed the 8 prena tally diagnosed female cases of severe EBP mutations listed in France. The mean age at prenatal diagnosis was 22 weeks of gestation. The ultrasound features included mainly bone abnormalities: shortening (7/8) and bowing of the long bones (4/8), stippled epiphyseal cartilage (5/8) and irregular aspect of the rachis (5/8). The pregnancy was terminated in 6/8 cases. Fe tal examination revealed ichthyosis in all cases and skeletal X rays showed constant epiphyseal stippling, with frequent asymmetrically shortened long bones and bowing. All cases appeared de novo except for two fetuses with moderately affected mothers, who presented ichthyosis and short stature, and one case of germinal mosaicism. In order to explain the high intrafa milial clinical heterogeneity, the X inactivation pattern was studied in one familial case. Skewed X inactivation was found in the motherÃ¢ÂÂs lymphocytes (cDNA study showed that the wild allele was mainly expressed) and random X inactivation was found in the different fetal tissues affected. In conclusion, we report additional cases of severe prenatal CDPX2 presen tations in female fetuses.

20917,"Objective: To estimate fetal fraction (FF) in monozygotic and dizygotic twin pregnancies. Methods: Maternal plasma samples were obtained from 35 monochorionic twin pregnancies with male fetuses (monozygotic) and 35 dichorionic preg nancies discordant for fetal sex (dizygotic) at 11 13 weeksÃ¢ÂÂ gestation. Cell free DNA was extracted and chromosome selective sequencing with digital analysis of selected regions (DANSR TM ) was carried out. The fetal fraction optimized risk of trisomy evaluation (FORTE TM ) algorithm was used to estimate FF using polymorphic alleles. In dizygotic twins the FORTE algo rithm was modified to estimate the smallest FF contribution of the 2 fetuses. In both types of twins, FF was also determined by analysis of Y chromosome sequences. Results: In monozygotic twins, the median total FF was 14.0% (range 8.2 27.0%) and in dizygotic twins the median smallest FF was 7.9% (4.9 14.0%). There were significant associations in FF between the methods using polymorphic alleles and Y chromosome sequences for both monozy gotic (r , 0.951, p < 0.0001) and dizygotic (r , 0.743, p < 0.0001) twins. Conclusions: The study demonstrates the feasibility of an approach for cfD NA testing in twin pregnancies. This involves estimation of total FF in mo nozygotic twins and estimation of the lower FF of the 2 fetuses in dizygotic twins.",2014

Maternal plasma and amniotic fluid samples were collected from 30 singleton pregnancies. Methylation sensitive restriction enzymes in digestion of differential maternal fetal methylation followed by fluorescent quantitative PCR (MSRE + PCR) were employed to detect trisomy 21. Dia gnosis of trisomy 21 was established according to the ratio of fetal specific AIRE to RASSF1A that are hypermethylated in maternal plasma and are not digested with methylation sensitive restriction enzymes. All of the results were approved with karyotype results. Based on the data from 22 euploidy pregnancies, the 95% reference interval of the fetal AIRE/RASSF1A ratio in maternal plasma was 0.33 1.77, which was taken as the reference value for determining the numbers of fetal chromosome 21 in 30 pregnancies. First ly, 18 from 22 euploidy pregnancies were detected euploid correctly and 4 cases incorrectly so the early sensitivity rate was 81.81% (18/22). But by repeating the test with better digestion, the four cases made correct results so the final sensitivity rate was 100% (22/22). All of the eight trisomy 21 pregnancies were diagnosed with this method correctly so the specificity of this method was 100%. Also with performing STR Typing and checking paternal alleles in maternal plasma and comparison with maternal alleles in 16 loci, the protocol of cell free fetal DNA extraction from plasma were confirmed.",2014

The NGS method was robust, with 454/454(100%) samples yielding results. Aneuploidy diagnoses were fully concordant with those obtained using aCGH technique. NGS was also able to detect chromosomal mosaicism in 54/54(100%) of mosaic embryos assessed. Clinical application of the NGS ABSTRACTS POSTERS ESHG 2014 | MILAN, ITALY | WWW. ESHG. ORG 55Back to inde x protocol revealed 76(39.6%) euploid blastocysts. Following transfer of 50 embryos, 30 women had a sustained pregnancy (63.8% clinical pregnancy rate/ET; 64.0% implantation rate). This is the first study reporting extensive validation and clinical application of NGS for PGS purpose, allowing identification and transfer of euploid em bryos resulting in healthy pregnancies. Evidence of accuracy demonstrates that NGS represents a reliable high throughput methodology for compre hensive aneuploidy screening, capable of detecting whole chromosome an euploidies and segmental changes in embryos, with the potential to revolu tionize preimplantation diagnosis.",2014
20926,"ApertÃ¢ÂÂs syndrome (Acrocephalo syndactyly) is a rare congenital condition characterized by primary craniosynostosis, mid face malformations and symmetrical syndactyly of the hand and feet. The incidence of ApertÃ¢ÂÂs syn drome is about 15/1.000.000 live birts and is inherited in an autosomal do minant fashion, but sporadic cases are also frequent. Case report: A 32 year old, gravida 4, para 0 woman was referred for fetal evaluation at 22 weeks of gestation because of digital abnormalities in the fetus. A prenatal ultrasound at 22 weeks of gestation revealed frontal bossing, low set ears, depressed nasal bridge, digital fusion, and bilateral syndactyly of the hands and feet. Amniocentesis was performed and the cytogenetics and the molecular test was done. A DNA testing for the FGFR2 gene was immediately performed using uncultured amniocytes, which revealed a heterozygous (P253R) mu tation in the FGFR2 gene. The karyotype was normal, 46,XY. The woman decided to discontinue the pregnancy, and a male baby was delivered with frontal bossing, midface hypoplasia and bilateral syndactyly of the hands (mittenhands) and feet.

Totally 165 (89.7 %) ca ses out of these 184 pathological results has been announced by QF PCR (most frequently an autosomal aneuploidy) prior to karyotyping. This is in contrast to 19 abnormal findings detected only due to classic chromosomal examination (9 balanced aberrations, 9 mosaics of both autosomes and gonosomes, 1 unbalanced aberration). In the same period of time 102 CVS (with normal karyotype and QF PCR results) were evaluated by SNP array (Illumina). Well defined pathogenic microdeletions or microduplications were detected in 7 CVS (6.8 %) indicated from following reasons: increased nuchal translucency (5 cases), heart defect (1 case) and anal and esophageal atresia (1 case).In our study, an examination of CVS based on QF PCR method only would let 19 abnormal findings (2.5%) undetected out of which only 10 (1.45 %) are defined as pathological (9 mosaics of both autosomes and gonosomes, 1 unbalanced aberration). In all 10 cases we suppose that these aberrations would be detected by SNP array evaluation. In addition to it, re examination of CVSs with normal karyotypes and QF PCR results by SNP array allowed us to detect another 7 submicroscopic pathological abnormities.

Results: Traditionally, maternal age has been the main referral reason for prenatal testing (69.3%) but du ring the last 3 years, prenatal screening has become the most important clinical indication, decreasing the number of invasive pro cedures performed. Related to karyotype analysis, chromosomal abnorma lities were detected in 348 out of the 16,894 (2.55%) cytogenetic studies. Among chromosome aneuploidies (1.55%), the most frequent ones were classical autosomal aneuploidies (1.09%): Trisomy 21, 18 and 13 were dia gnosed in 115 (0.94%), 23 (0.07%) and 9 (0.06%) cases respectively. Sex chromosome neuploidies were found in 59 cases (0.46%), being Klinefelter Syndrome the most common sex aneuploidy diagnosed (0.16%). Balanced rearrangements corresponded to 0.67% of the structural abnormalities while unbalanced rearrangements were found in 16 cases (0.15%). Con clusion: Nowadays, positive prenatal screening has progressively replaced advanced maternal age as the main referral reason for amniocentesis. Our study based in 16,894 amniocentesis contributes to establish a standard re ference incidence of chromosomal abnormalities in pregnancies. Our data also confirm the karyotype as a reliable method for detecting complex chro mosome abnormalities, providing an important basis for prenatal counse ling and for prenatal screening policy in the national strategy.",2014

Objective: To describe the clinical observations following implementation of a SNP based non invasive prenatal aneuploidy test in more than 28,000 pregnant women. Methods: 28,709 consecutive cases reported since March 2013 for NIPT . Iso lated cfDNA was amplified via multiplex PCR targeting 19,488 SNPs covering chromosomes 13, 18, 21, X, and Y. Sequencing data was analyzed the NATUS algorithm. Reports were issued describing risk for trisomy 21, trisomy 18, trisomy 13, and Monosomy X, and in a subset of cases triploidy, sex chro mosomes trisomies and fetal sex. All reports included fetal cfDNA fraction. Follow up information on samples receiving a high risk result for trisomy 21, trisomy 18, trisomy 13, or Monosomy X was collected from providers. Results: 510 (1.8%) cases received a high risk NIPT result for any of the four main indications (325 trisomy 21, 83 trisomy 18, 41 trisomy 13, 61 Mono somy X). Of the 28,709 cases, 49% were under 35 years of age. 17,529 low risk results and 358 high risk results were reported to centers participating in follow up efforts. A response to requests for follow up information was received for 317/358 (88.5%) of the high risk patients; including 120 calls (33.5%) with karyotype. These requests identified 21 false positives (8 tri somy 21, 1 trisomy 18, 8 trisomy 13, 4 Monosomy X). Two (0.01%) trisomy 21 false negative results were voluntarily reported.

ESX1 mRNA expression was previously investigated by our group in testi cular biopsies of infertile men and correlated to the presence of residual spermatogenesis in Non Obstructive Azoospermic (NOA) patients. Here, we further deepen this issue investigating by real time PCR ESX1 expression in both testicular fragments (TF) and seminal fluids (SF) of 78 NOA men. The aim was to verify whether a positive ESX1 expression in TF or even in SF was predictive of a successfully sperm recovery at TESE/microTESE. Con cerning TF, ESX1 mRNA levels: 1) significantly decrease with the increasing of spermatogenesis defect, as classified by histology; 2) are higher in dilated tubules, likely containing spermatozoa, compared to thin ones. In addition, the presence of a positive or negative testicular expression of ESX1 strongly correlates (p<0.0001) with positive or negative sperm recovery at surgery. Regarding SF, ESX1 mRNA expression was detected in the ejaculate of 44/56 azoospermic men, at lower levels than normospermic men (p<0.05). No si gnificant differences were found in ESX1 expression levels among samples with different degree of spermatogenic failure, based on histological clas sification. Regarding spermatozoa recovery and ESX1 expression in SF, the two variables were concordant in 33/56 (59%) of cases. The overall data reinforce a correlation between a positive ESX1 mRNA detection and resi dual spermatogenesis in testes of NOA patients, indicating a role of ESX1 as predictive spermatogenesis molecular marker.

Diminished Ovarian Reserve(DOR) and Ovarian Hyper Stimulation Syndrome(OHSS) are infertility disorders in which womenÃ¢ÂÂs ovaries donÃ¢ÂÂt have proper response to gonadotropins. Follicle stimulating hormone(FSH) has a critical role in the maturation of the ovarian follicles from the antral to the graffian stage. FSH will start a signaling cascade in the granulosa cells after sitting on its receptor(FSHR). Alteration of this receptor may change follicle maturation and therefore result in improper response to gonadotro pins. We investigated the association of FSH receptor gene alteration in DOR and OHSS patients. The presence of P .Ala307Thr, P .Ser680Ala, P . Ala665Thr and Mut. Val341Ala were analyzed in a case control study. 31 Iranian DOR and 34 Iranian OHSS patients were selected as the case group. 30 Iranian fertile women were enrolled as the control group. The patients DNA were extracted from their peripheral blood and amplified by relevant primers. For determining allelic variant status all PCR products were analyzed by Sequencing. The results were unexpected; the homozygous Ser680 and Ala307 variants seem to be significantly associated with OHSS. The FSHR P .Ala665Thr genotype frequency was similar in all patients and controls. The number of oocytes retrieved was comparable between patients with different FSHR genotype. Although data are accumulating with evidence suggesting that the ovarian response to gonadotropins is mediated by dif ferent genetic alterations, as in some previous studies homozygousity for Ser680 was significantly associated with DOR, the optimal biomarkers and the efficacy of the tests still remain to be evaluated.",2014
20934,"One of the major effort in medical genetics is the development of non inva sive prenatal diagnosis, aimed to replace current invasive methodologies. It is well known that the circulating free fetal cells may be employed as a new alternative source of DNA for prenatal diagnosis, in order to avoid the risks associated to invasive diagnosis. The cell free fetal DNA (cffDNA) in mater nal plasma or serum allows the development of non invasive method for the detection of chromosomal and molecular diseases. The same approach can be even applied to determine fetal sex and the risk for X linked genetic disorders. To date, several techniques, such as PCR, Real Time PCR, Next Generation Sequencing, have been employed for cffDNA analysis. Here we propose a new molecular technology (PlexorÃÂ® HY System), based on Real Time PCR for fetal sex determination. The PlexorÃÂ® technology takes advantage of the specific interaction between two modified nucleotides and the reduction in fluorescence. The qPCR approach allows the simultaneous quantificati on and detection of fetal sex in pregnant women. Peripheral blood samp les were obtained from 50 pregnant women at the 12th to 14th gestational week and the cffDNA was isolated from maternal plasma. Determination of fetal sex of all samples demonstrated a concordance of 100% with the results obtained by traditional method (karyotyping).

The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of this FSHB SNP on male in fertility. The SNP was analyzed in 83 men with oligoasthenozoospermia/ azoospermia (group 1) and in 82 normozoospermic controls (group 2). Ge notyping of SNP was performed by Real time PCR with TaqMan Genotyping Assay. The FSHB genotypes frequencies were: 74.4% (GG), 22.7% (GT) and 2.9% (TT). The distribution frequency of heterozygous and homozygous T carriers was significantly different between the two groups: 65.8% of GT heterozygotes and 100% of TT homozygotes were found in group 1 (Z test, p,0.0057). The T allele frequency was statistically different in the two groups: 18,6% and 7,9% in group 1 and 2, respectively (Z test, p,0.007). Moreover, the FSH serum levels were differently distributed with a trend from the highest values in the GG genotype to the lowest levels in the TT genotype (Kruskall Wallis test: p,0.037).

About one third of the requests for molecular prenatal diagnostics we recei ve are for HD. However, molecular testing is performed on fetal DNA derived from invasive procedures. Therefore, there is a request for alternative, less invasive methods. Noninvasive prenatal diagnosis (NIPD) using total cell free DNA (cfDNA) from maternal plasma for the detection of paternally in herited mutations in the fetus is achievable for a range of genetic disorders.

The objective was to elucidate gene expression patterns in KS and whether these would be related to inherent pathologies. Gene expression was substantially disturbed in KS vs. both control groups. The differential expression of 36 not only X chromosomal genes puts these phenotypical males into a genetic framework located between men and wo men with normal karyotypes. A range of these genes has previously been attributed to gender specific modulations of immune responses. The KS cohort exhibited increased insulin resistance/inflammatory status, a pro coagulatory state, higher waist circumference, dyslipidemia and an altered cardiac rhythmogenic setting. The extent of clinical dyshomeostasis was as sociated with the expression of dysregulated genes. Paternal origin of the supernumerary X chromosome was an additional confounder regarding in sulin resistance and cardiac phenotype. In KS patients, the supernumerary X chromosome contributes to a num ber of pathologies by altering gene expression patterns: insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, enhanced inflammation markers as well as altered cardiac rhythmogenic setting are involved; this was observable independently from testosterone substitution treatment which may have attenuated responses in KS.

We reported previously that the mRNA levels of laeve rin gene are significantly up regulated in preeclamptic compared to healthy placentas, indicating that laeverin might play a role in the pathophysiology of preeclampsia. Immunofluorescence studies have indicated that laeverin protein is highly expressed in the cytoplasm, instead of the plasmamembra ne, of villous trophoblasts in preeclamptic placentas.

CNV67 was detected exclusively in patients (1.1%) and was maternally transmitted. The oligozoospermic phenotype of one carrier versus his normozoospermic non carrier brother strongly indicates a pathogenic effect of the deletion on spermatogenesis. MAGEA9, an ampliconic gene reported as independently acquired on the human X chromosome with exclusive physiological expression in the testis, is likely to be involved in CNV67. Our investigation further indicates an as sociation between X linked CNV burden and spermatogenic impairment and identifies the first X chromosome linked recurrent deletion and duplication with clinical significance.",2014

The pathogenesis of oligo/astheno/teratospermia is unknown in most pa tients. Especially, the proportion of genetic and environmental factors has been hard to tease apart. However, transcriptomic or proteomic approaches can identify common dysregulated genes or pathways in sperm, that are substantial for their function, regardless the ultimate etiological factor. We analyzed twelve semen samples according to WHO criteria (2010). Four of the participants were fertile donors, clinically and andrologically normal, who had achieved pregnancy in a period less that twelve months and got a live born baby in the last year. Seven samples were from infertile patients ex amined in our clinic that presented with oligospermia and abnormal sperm head morphology, including decapitation. We performed genome wide ex pression analysis using Affymetrix HuGene2.1ST microaarays. The principal component analysis revealed substantial overlap between normal and abnormal samples. These results indicate that despite the com mon result of morphologically abnormal spermatozoa, the underlying cau ses of the infertility might be diverse. Surprisingly four genes were markedly different between fertile and infer tile sperm samples: an uncharacterized gene, a small nucleolar RNA gene, a microRNA gene and RIPK4 .

20947,"Aneuploidy of fetal chromosomes is one of the causes of pregnancy loss or congenital birth defects. It is known that the frequency of oocyte aneuploidy increases with maternal age in humans. Recent data have highlighted the contribution of cohesin complex in the correct segregation of meiotic chro mosomes. In mammalian oocytes, cohesion is established during the fetal stage and meiosis specific cohesin subunits are not replenished after birth. This raises the possibility that the long meiotic arrest of oocytes facilitates the deterioration of cohesion leading to the age related increase in aneuplo idy. We here examined the cohesin levels in dictyate oocytes from different age groups. Samples were obtained from the ovarian tissues of 8 women (age range: 19 49 years) and also from 2 and 10 month old female mice. Ovarian tissue sections were immunostained using cohesin antibodies and the cohesin levels were determined by immunofluorescence. The levels of the meiosis specific cohesin subunits, REC8 and SMC1B, were found to be decreased in women aged 40 and over compared with those aged around 20. An age related decrease in meiotic cohesins was also evident in mice. Interestingly, SMC1A, the mitotic counterpart of SMC1B, was readily detec table in human oocytes but only barely in mice. The mitotic cohesin levels of mice slightly increased with age. These results suggest that, mitotic and meiotic cohesins may act in a coordinate manner in humans to maintain the levels of this protein over a sustained period. The decreased meiotic co hesin subunit levels with age impairs sister chromatid cohesion leading to increased segregation errors.",2014

Patients: Three affected siblings with arthrogryposis and an increased nuchal fold / cystic hygroma in two, were detected at 11 15 weeks of gesta tion. Parents were AJ with non contributory family history. Methods and Results: Histopathology with electron microscopy of muscle samples suggested NM on two siblings.

Further studies should be performed to validate its carrier frequency among this population. Also, the severe stigmata in affected patients harboring this splice mutation, suggests its critical role in disease pathogenesis.

False positive rates can be as low as 0.1%. However, dis crepancies between positive NIPT result and fetal karyotype on chorionic villus sampling or amniocentesis may occur.

20960,", San Carlos, CA, United States. Introduction: Microdeletions, which may result in mental and physical handicaps, are challenging to detect using cell free DNA based NIPT due to their smaller size. Additionally, sample rarity and the later gestational ages at which samples are generally collected complicate test performance vali dation. We created artificial pregnancy plasma DNAs (plasmArts) to circum vent these issues, demonstrating accurate detection of five microdeletions: 22q11.2, Cri du Chat, 1p36, Prader Willi, and Angelman. Methods: DNA isolated from cell lines, affected or unaffected children, and their unaffected mothers, was treated to generate nucleosomal ladders, mi micking maternal/fetal cfDNA fragment lengths. These Ã¢ÂÂcfDNAsÃ¢ÂÂ were mixed to mimic fetal fraction distributions in the target gestational age population, and were analyzed alongside pregnancy plasmas using the PanoramaTM NIPT , which reports copy number and associated confidence for each chro mosome. 469 samples (111 artificial mixtures of mother/child DNA derived from 5 affected and 1 unaffected children and their unaffected mothers, 6 affected and 352 unaffected pregnancy plasmas) mimicking various fetal fractions were tested. Results: NIPT correctly distinguished affected and unaffected Ã¢ÂÂpregnancyÃ¢ÂÂ plasmArts, suggesting that mixtures behaved similarly to maternal plasma cfDNA. This SNP based assay detected deletions to as low as 3.9% fetal frac tion. The anticipated false positive rate based on the observed fetal fraction distributions and unaffected pregnancy plasma measurements is Ã¢ÂÂ¤1%. Conclusions: PlasmArt samples generated appropriate NIPT results, allo wing robust test performance validation for rare conditions. This approach accurately identified pregnancies with a fetus affected by various microdele tions. This will increase NIPT clinical coverage and allow for earlier prenatal screening for sub chromosomal deletions.",2014

20963,"Noonan syndrome (NS) is an autosomal dominant inherited disorder caused by heterozygous mutations of several genes within the RAS/mitogen activa ted protein kinase pathway. NS is characterized by short stature, minor facial and cardiac anomalies. Frequent prenatal ultrasound findings are increased nuchal translucency in addition with distended jugular lymphatic sacs, cy stic hygroma, hydrops, hydrothorax, ascites, polyhydramnios, cardiac and renal anomalies. There is high variability of clinical symptoms even within single families. We present a retrospective study of 23 prenatally diagnosed cases with mutations in PTPN11, SOS1, RAF1 genes from a cohort of 330 fetuses with ultrasound findings indicating NS and normal karyotype. Cases were seen in a single tertiary center between 2005 and 2014 by an expert team of experienced sonographers and human geneticists. Prenatal ultra sound findings, molecular genetic data and postnatal phenoptype will be re ported. Some cases are exemplified with clinical, ultrasound and molecular genetic data. In our study we want to emphasize the importance of prenatal molecular testing of Noonan genes (panel) in cases with an increased nuchal translucency and at least one additional feature mentioned above. Progno sis depends on molecular genetic findings in conjunction with ultrasound abnormalities which can change dramatically in the course of pregnancy. The occurrence of severe progredient hydrops or hydrothorax in the second or third trimester is associated with a high risk for an unfavourable outco me. Genetic counseling remains demanding due to the high variability in the prenatal and postnatal spectrum of symptoms in NS and the difficulty to give a reliable prognosis.",2014
20964,"Osteogenesis Imperfecta (OI) is a heritable connective tissue disorder, cha racterized by a wide clinical spectrum, ranging from few fractures in mild cases to perinatal lethality. During pregnancy, if severe forms are usually easily early recognizable, the mild and moderate forms may lead to noto riously difficulties in the evaluation of the postnatal prognosis. Objective: to evaluate the contribution of prenatal imaging, family history and molecular analysis in the postnatal prognosis in osteogenesis imperfecta. Methods: to analyze retrospectively the prenatal features (fetal ultrasound examination and 3D CT scan), family history and postnatal outcomes (phenotype and ge notype) of 30 cases diagnosed antenatally as OI in our hospital. Results: In 15 cases, the severe fetal presentation led to pregnancy termination. Among the 15 remaining cases that are still alive, 4 are considered as severe, 6 as moderate and 5 as mild. The family history appears to be the best prenatal predictor of postnatal severity. We emphasize the sensitivity of the 3D CT scan. Molecular screening was not helpful in the prognosis given a priori to the parents. No correlation between the severity of skeletal phenotype and the genotype was demonstrated a posteriori. Importantly, in 3 cases with marked bowing of the long bones, a significant improvement of the bone de formities was observed after birth. Conclusion: OI is today easily diagnosed during pregnancy based on the improvement of the recent imaging tools; however, the postnatal prognosis is still often difficult to evaluate, highligh ting the value of a family history.",2014

However, in order to establish a robust PCR based PGD protocol, extensive preclinical experiments are nee ded to ascertain the efficiency and reliability of the procedure, which is a labor intensive, time consuming and costly process. Many clinical applications based on targeted Massively parallel sequencing (MPS) have been reported. In this study, we explored the applicability of tar geted MPS for PGD of monogenic disease. Isolated single lymphocytes were used to evaluate the genotyping accuracy of target MPS at single cell level at first. Then two families carrying mutation of the HBB causing ÃÂ² thalassemia were tested using targeted MPS. Pedigree haplotype analysis was applied in the following analysis and doub le blind design was used in the study. Over hundred of informative SNPs flanking both sides of the disease causing mutation were detected for each embryonic haplotype. The average interval between informative SNPs and gene mutation was within 10 kb. The final result was 100% consistent with the diagnosis provided by the reference laboratory, and the whole test was finished within a week.

20970,"Carriers of balanced translocations are at high risk for unbalanced game tes which can result in recurrent miscarriages or birth defects. Preimplan tation genetic diagnosis (PGD) is often offered to select balanced embryos. This selection is currently mainly performed by array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) on blastomeres. Current methodology does not take into account the phase of the cell cycle, despite the variable copy number status of different genomic regions in S phase. To evaluate the accuracy of single cell array CGH, different cell cycle phases from three cell lines deri ved from patients with different chromosomal imbalances were sorted by flow cytometry. Ten single cells were picked per cell line per cell cycle phase, whole genome amplified and analyzed by BAC arrays, the most commonly used platform for PGD purposes. In contrast to G phase, where the imba lances were efficiently identified, the log2 intensity ratios of less than half of the probes in the regions of interest were above the detection threshold in 17/26 analyzed S phase cells. The results demonstrate that the accuracy to detect segmental chromosomal imbalances is reduced in S phase cells, which could be a source of misdiagnosis in PGD. Hence, the determination of the cell cycle phase of the analyzed cell is of great importance and should be taken into account during the analysis.

Single nucleotide polymor phism (SNP) arrays are useful in identifying single genes and genome regi ons responsible for the onset of POI. The present study included 700 women with idiopathic POI with the cessation of ovarian function before 40 years of age.

The method is based on the evaluation of fragmentÃ¢ÂÂs relative abundance of cell free DNA (cffDNA) in maternal plasma. The fetal fraction of the total free DNA is 5 25 %, according to the stage of pregnancy. Extraction of cffDNA exploits the fact that cffDNA is significantly smaller than the maternal DNA, with fragments approximately 200bp in size. cffDNA subsequently subjects to whole genome sequencing using next generation sequencing platform based on the semiconductor sequencing technology. Examination method Prenascan is perfomable between 10 and 21 weeks of pregnancy, only after genetic counseling. Diagnostic sensitivity of the method is about 96 % to de tect the tested trisomy.

Results: High resolution testing revealed a diagnostic yield of 6.9% and 1.6% in cases of fetal ultrasound anomalies and cases of advance maternal age (AMA), respectively, which is similar to previous studies using low reso lution microarrays. In 3 (0.6%) additional cases with indication AMA an ab erration in susceptibility risk loci was detected.

We found the rate of cases, in which the parents had to be tested for interpretation of unreported copy number variants (3.7%), and the rate of remaining variants of unknown significance (0.4%) acceptably low. Of note, these findings did not cause termination of pregnancy after ex pert genetic counseling. The 0.4% rate of confined placental mosaicism was similar to that observed by conventional karyoytyping and notably involved a case of placental microdeletion.

Noninvasive prenatal testing based on massively parallel sequencing (MPS) of circulating cell free DNA (ccfDNA) from pregnant plasma offers a po werful tool for detecting fetal chromosomal aneuploidies and other copy number variations; however, copy neutral structural rearrangements have proven challenging. We aimed to detect and characterize a balanced fetal specific translocation event by sequencing ccfDNA from maternal plasma. Simulations were used to develop an algorithm which leverages base incre mental changes in mapping characteristics of ccfDNA to identify paired end reads potentially harboring structural rearrangements. We then applied this methodology on high coverage 100bp paired end data from ccfDNA isolated from a 38 year old pregnant donor carrying a fetus with a balanced trans location. Our algorithm identified the known translocation (p,1.21e 8) and discounted the likelihood of others, enabling the base specific localization of the breakpoints. Furthermore, while no evidence of chromothripsis existed, we identified a 6bp deletion present within der(8) which is absent from the der(11) reciprocal rearrangement after de novo assembly of 76 chimeric reads.

We report on a Turkish family where the se cond child, a 36 months old boy, presented with typical MCPH. The parents were first cousins, and the mother was in the 9th week of her third preg nancy. Next generation sequencing of the probandÃ¢ÂÂs DNA showed a homo zygous ASPM mutation, a 1bp insertion in exon 18 causing a frameshift and premature stop codon, c.6513dupA (p. Val2172SerfsX7). Both parents were heterozygous for the mutation. They opted for prenatal diagnosis, and am niocytes DNA showed homozygosity for the mutation. The pregnancy was continued, and the parents declined further examinations. This case illustra tes the power of high throughput sequencing for rapid prenatal diagnosis of MPCH, where phenotypic correlations should eventually help understand how MCPH genes shape various parts of the cortex, central gray matter, and other parts of the encephalon.",2014

Despite the identification of numerous candidate genes in POI women, the genetic origin has been clarified only in about 20% of the pati ents. The patients showing the most severe phenotype, characterized by the absence of pubertal development and primary amenorrhea (PA) and 46,XX ovarian dysgenesis, are indeed rare but the search for genetic variations in this extreme phenotype may be more effective in identifying novel pathoge nic mechanisms. To unveil new POI causative genes we searched for rare high penetrance CNVs involving genes essential for ovarian function in a cohort of 46,XX pa tients affected by PA. Forty three patients were processed by high resolution array CGH. Thirty seven patients were found to bear 98 CNVs not reported to date in healthy subjects according to the Database of Genomic Variants (DGV), and 11 CNVs already reported in DGV but relevant to gene content, for a total of 109 CNVs. Several of these genomic alterations include genes implicated in: meiotic resumption, oogonia maintenance, first polar body extrusion, DNA repair, follicle adhesion/migration regulation, actin remo delling, cholesterol endocytosis, Ca2+ homeostasis. Once characterized by other molecular and bioinformatics approaches, the results of this study are promising to expand the knowledge about the mole cular pathways involved in POI pathogenesis and probably provide the basis for a more accurate genetic diagnosis of POI patients.",2014

Quantitative fluorescent polymerase chain reaction (QF PCR) is an accurate and efficient technique for rapid prenatal diagnosis of trisomy 13, 18 and 21 and aneuploidies of the sex chromosomes. Discordant results between QF PCR and karyotyping have occasionally been reported, mostly due to mosaicism. A 20 year old female underwent chorionic villus sampling at 13 weeksÃ¢ÂÂ ge station because of an increased risk of a chromosomal aberration after first trimester screening. Ultrasound investigation demonstrated no abnormali ties. The results from the QF PCR analysis were interpreted as a possible mosaic 45,X/46,XY because of the low contribution of the Y chromosome. Conventional karyotyping of the LTC demonstrated a non mosaic 45,X. Sin ce no abnormal findings were detected on ultrasound, a confined placental mosaicism was suggested as a possible explanation for the discordant fin dings. A subsequent amniocentesis revealed a normal male genotype with QF PCR. Karyotyping, on the contrary, demonstrated a mosaic pattern with 45,X and a structural rearranged Y chromosome, probably an i(Yp). Addi tional FISH confirmed the presence of an isochromosome of the short arm of the Y chromosome. The case presented here demonstrates that caution should be taken when conflicting results are observed in CVS even if a nor mal profile is obtained with QF PCR in a follow up amniocentesis. This case further illustrate that mosaicism for an abnormal cell line can result in a normal QF PCR profile.",2014

Background: We established a population based surveillance of CM in the Rivne (R) province of Ukraine. The northern half of R or Polissia (P) is polluted by Chornobyl ionizing radiation. Analyses of observations during 2000 2009 demonstrated elevated population based rates of specific CM; that prenatal exposure to alcohol was an unlikely cause as well as WBC Bq counts of pregnant women residing in P that often were above the officially set safe limits (Wertelecki et al., in Congenital Anomalies, 2014 in press).Objectives: determine the degree of persistence of population based rates of CM, patterns of alcohol use during pregnancy and of WBC patterns among pregnant women. Methods: adherence to procedures of the European CM monitoring consor tium (EUROCAT); analysis of CM patterns among 180,559 births in R during 2000 2011; and analysis of WBC obtained from 9,169 pregnant women in R during 2008 2012.Results: persistence of higher rates in P than in non P of conjoined twins, teratomas, neural tube defects, microcephaly, and microphthalmia; less pre valent prenatal exposures to alcohol in P; and persistence of elevated WBC (above 3750 Bq) in 19% of pregnant women residing in P and nearly 0.2% among those residing in non P .Conclusions: Higher rates of specific CM, for the most part blastopathies, and elevated WBC of incorporated 137Cs by pregnant women are persistent in the P region of the Rivne province.

20988,"Introduction: Recurrent miscarriage(RM) is defined as two or more conse cutive pregnancy losses before 20 weeks of gestation which is an impor tant clinical problem, with an incidence of 1% 3% among couples wishing to have children. There are several factors in the etiology of RM. One of the main genetic causes involve in the pathogenesis of RM is balanced chromo somal rearrangements in one or both of partners. In 4% 8% of couples with RM, at least one of the partners has chromosomal abnormality. After chro mosomal abnormalities, thrombophilia was identified as a major cause of RM, with a rate of up to 40%, especially in the first half of pregnancy. Methods: The patients group included 1100 Iranian couples(2200 individu als) referred to Royan Institute between 2004 and 2013. Karyotyping was performed using standard cytogenetic techniques. Besides, thrombotic gene polymorphisms were studied in 128 women who had a normal karyotype .The results were compared with 70 healthy women as control group. Results: Abnormal karyotypes were found in 124 people, 83 women (3.77%) and 41 men (1.86%). The frequencies of FV Leiden, Prothrombin G20210A, MTHFRC677T and MTHFRA1298C mutations in patients were 10.93%,4.68%,43.75% and60.15%, respectively. These frequencies in con trol group were 2.85%,2.85%,34.28% and5.71% respectively.

20989,"I. Vavilov Institute of General Genetics, MOSCOW, Russian Federation. Recurrent miscarriage (RM) is one of the important problems of modern re productive medicine. RM affects approximately 1 Ã¢ÂÂ 5 % of all couples trying to conceive. Various factors have been identified that influence miscarriage, including parental chromosomal abnormalities, endocrine dysfunction, and others. However 50% of cases fail to reveal an identifiable cause and are therefore classified as idiopathic. We investigated the association of polymorphisms in oxidative stress rela ted genes with idiopathic RM. 331 idiopathic RM patients and 197 controls were genotyped for ABCB1 rs1045642, CYP1A1 rs1048943 and rs4646903, COMT rs4680, CAT rs17880664, GCLC rs17883901, GPX4 rs713041, NRF2 rs6721961, SOD2 rs4880, and OGG1 rs1052133.

20992,"Introduction: Recurrent Pregnancy Loss (RPL) is defined as the occurrence of two or more consecutive pregnancy loss prior to 20th week of gestation. There are several leading causes of RPL including uterine anatomical de fects, genetic factors, infectious, immunological, environmental and blood dyscariasis. However, despite in a large number of cases no cause has been identified and is classified as idiopathic. Recent studies have implicated miRNAs in endometriosis, preeclampsia, infertility and RPL. Therefore; the aim of the present study was to investigate the association of miR 196a2C>T (rs11614913) with RPL. Methods: We conducted a case control study of 185 Iranian women: 85 pa tients with at least two unexplained consecutive pregnancy losses and 100 healthy controls with at least one live birth and no history of pregnancy loss. Patients with recurrent pregnancy losses due to anatomic, hormonal, chromosomal, infectious, autoimmune, or thrombotic causes were excluded from the study group.

Methods A questionnaire was mailed to all DNA diagnostic laboratories assessing: 1) Number of independent muta tion positive families identified until January 2013 2) Number of PNDs per formed for these syndromes until that date One sided Fishers exact test was used to compare uptake of PND for Rb with the other five tumor syndromes. Results 11.8% of mutation positive Rb families used PND, whereas uptake for the other syndromes was between never and 6.5%. For Rb PND was used both by couples with a 50% risk and by healthy couples with a child with a de novo mutation (2 3% risk). Overall uptake for PND was significantly higher for Rb than for FAP , HBOC and NF2. If just Rb couples with a 50% risk were taken into account, only a significant difference was found between Rb and FAP and HBOC. Conclusion Large differences in the use of PND between tumor predisposing syndromes were observed.

Study Design: Blood samples were prospectively collected from pregnant women at 21 US sites in the Comparison of Aneuploidy Risk Evaluation (CARE) study (clinicaltri als.gov NCT01663350). Patients undergoing serum screening for fetal aneu ploidy were followed to birth. Sex chromosome status was classified blindly by NIPT and compared to clinical outcome based on newborn physical ex amination, or karyotype if performed. Sensitivity, specificity and exact 95% confidence intervals based on the Clopper Pearson method were calculated. Results: Sex chromosome classification by NIPT and outcomes were avai lable for 1,948 subjects. 1,935 (99.3%) were classified as XX or XY by NIPT . Sensitivity and specificity for predicting female were 97.7% (CI:96.6 98.6) and 99.2% (CI:98.4 99.6), respectively, and 99.2% (CI:98.4 99.6) and 97.7% (CI:96.6 98.6) for predicting male.

Psychological help was available in all cases if needed. Results: In 36 cases out of 2108 ongoing pregnancies a SL was found. 1. Two couples with an increased risk for aneuploidy and no US abnormali ties opted for TOP . Both couples already had Ã¢ÂÂa bad feelingÃ¢ÂÂ about the preg nancy before testing. They received psychological help. Pathological exami nation (N,1) revealed no structural abnormalities. 2. For parents with fetal US abnormalities the SL was usually considered as less important. The US abnormalities were the reason for TOP . 3.The inherited nature of SL seemed reassuring. Conclusions: In 5,5 % (2/36) of the SL cases the pregnancy was terminated due to the presence of the SL. Further follow up of the families and their children is needed to evaluate the significance of prenatal diagnosed SL, to offer early intervention when neurodevelopmental disorders emerge and to evaluate the psychological impact of prenatally discovered SL.",2014
21000,"Genomic imprinting is one of the most important epigenetic mechanisms of fetal growth regulation. Our studies demonstrated that multilocus methyla tion defects (MLMD) at imprinted genes may be responsible for pathology of early embryonic development. The aim of the present research was analysis of origin of MLMD in first trimester spontaneous abortions (SA). Chorionic villus samples (CVS) and extraembryonic mesoderm (EM) were collected from 217 SA from women who underwent abortion procedures. Induced abortion (IA) with normal karyotype (n , 60) were investigated as a control group. The DNA methylation patterns of 7 imprinted genes were analyzed in both tissues using MS PCR, including analyses of 51 imprinted genes from 15 SA and 4 IA by GoldenGate Methylation Cancer Panel I microarray. Compa rative analysis of epimutations distribution between studied tissues allows the identification its somatic or germinal origin. Presence of epimutations in both tissues indicates about mistake reprogramming in the primordial germ cells during gametogenesis. Whereas tissue specific compartmentalisation of epimutations allows suggesting independent sporadic epigenetic events in various embryonic germ layers after its divergence. No epimutations were found in the 60 IA samples. Somatic MLMD in SA occurred more frequently than germinal epimutations (129 epimutations per 1808 alleles vs. 32/904; p<0.001). Multiple somatic epimutations were found more frequently in the EM (52/904; 31/904) than in the CVS (32/904; 14/904; p<0.05). Multiple hypomethylation in both tissues occurred more frequently than hyperme thylation (96/1808; 33/1808; p<0.001). Thus, abnormalities of imprinting maintenance in the EM cells derived from epiblast progenitors are asso ciated with fetal loss in first trimester.",2014

Mosaicism for chromosomal structural rearrangements (Rea) is rare. There is much to learn about the timing and mechanisms of Rea formation and maintenance, and clinical manifestation. The question as to whether the proportion of abnormal cells in cultured blood is significant remains open. A recent study showed a strong female preponderance among carriers of mosaicism for Reas with pericentromeric breaks indicating female specific instability in early embryos (Kovaleva NV. AJMG,136A:401 13). Objectives: (i) Comparative analysis of the male/female ratio in carriers of gonadal mo saicism (GM) for balanced and unbalanced Reas, (ii) comparative analysis of the proportion of cells with unbalanced Rea in blood cultures of asympto matic and affected carriers. Method: Review of mosaicism for normal line/ structural Rea cases of known sex identified from the literature. Results: (1) Among carriers of GM for balanced Rea (all asymptomatic) there was a ty pical male predominance, 18M/15F, unlike the strong female predominance among carriers of GM for unbalanced Rea (both asymptomatic and affec ted), 9M/34F, p<0.001. (2) Only one of eight male carriers with poor repro ductive history was reported to have sterility, the others had partners with spontaneous/habitual abortion. (3) Seven of eight (88%) affected carriers of unbalanced Rea displayed a high proportion (Ã¢ÂÂ¥50%) of abnormal cells compared to 2/27 (8%) in asymptomatic carriers, p<0.01. Conclusions: A strong female prevalence among carriers of GM for unbalanced Rea suggests male specific selection against abnormal cells rather than impairment of male gametogenesis. A high proportion of abnormal cells detected in cultu red T lymphocytes is associated with clinical manifestation of chromosomal imbalance.",2014
21002,"Background Children born after in vitro fertilisation (IVF) with or without intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) are at increased risk for congenital anomalies. Recent publications suggest that the underlying parental sub fertility is mainly responsible for this risk increase, rather than the IVF/ICSI procedures, but it is unclear how. Our study aimed to identify whether offspring of subfertile couples are at increased risk for a de novo mutation or microdeletion. Materials and methods Data were used from the birth defects registry Eu rocat Northern Netherlands. We included malformed foetuses and children born between 1997 2010 (N,5709). Of those, 5249 were born to fertile couples and 460 to subfertile couples (83 after IVF, 95 after ICSI, 282 concei ved naturally after a time to pregnancy >12 months). We analysed whether parental subfertility was associated with de novo mutations or microdele tions. Results From the 5709 malformed cases, 156 (2.7%) had a monogenic condition resulting from a de novo mutation and 61 (1.1%) had a de novo chromosomal microdeletion. Parental subfertility was not associated with de novo mutations (OR 0.88, 95%CI 0.47 1.63) or microdeletions (OR 1.04, 95%CI 0.41 2.60). Subgroup analyses showed that IVF or ICSI alone were not associated with a de novo event either. Adjustment for paternal and ma ternal age did not change the results. Conclusion Parental subfertility, IVF and ICSI are not associated with de novo mutations or microdeletions in offspring. These results suggest that the previously established increased risk of congenital anomalies after IVF/ICSI is not explained by an increase in de novo events.

Prenatally sSMC are present in about 0.075% of the tests and postnatally in 0.044% of live born children. An overall risk of an abnormal phenotype is about 30%.We report on a 31 year old woman (first pregnancy, after IVF) referred for genetic counselling because of increased foetal nuchal translucency (5,5mm at CRL 55,9mm) and increased risk of trisomy 21 (1:11) and trisomy 18 (1:207) in first trimester combined prenatal screening. Ultrasound scan ning at 17th week of gestation revealed no heart defects but an increased nuchal fold, left sided diaphragmatic hernia and hydronephrosis. Cytogenetic studies of amniocytes showed a karyotype as follows: 48,XX,+mar1,+mar2. ParentsÃ¢ÂÂ karyotypes were normal. To determine the origin of the markers, array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) was used (Agilent SurePrint G3 Human CGH Microarray Kit 4 x 180K platform). Te trasomy of the region 13q31.3 to 13q34 arr[hg19] 13q31.3q34(92507936 115092648) was showed. The pregnancy was terminated at 18th week of gestation. Post mortem ex amination revealed dysmorphic facial features, head and body dispropor tion (head diameter: 8cm, CRL 12,5cm), wide neck, ambiguous genitalia. No other malformations of the internal organs, except listed above, were found. It is known that a risk of an abnormal phenotype associated with de novo sSMC derived from chromosome 13 (or 14, 21, 22) is about 7%.

21004,"Recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL) is a heterogeneous condition affecting up to 5% of women of reproductive age. Thrombophilias (acquired and inherited) have been postulated as one of the causes of RPL. Here we examined the prevalence of nine thrombophilic gene polymorphisims among women with history of recurrent miscarriages and fertile controls. The study included 70 women with history of at least two early pregnancy losses (before 20 th ge station week) and 30 fertile controls with no miscarriages. We investigated mutations in genes responsible for cloating and fibrinolysis, including FV Leiden, FV H1299R, FII G20210A, MTHFR C677T and A1298C, F XIII V34L, PAI 1 4G/5G and EPCR H1 and H3 haplotypes using reverse PCR Vienna lab CVD StrippAssays. Our results showed no statistically significant diffe rence in prevalence of specific gene mutations between two tested groups. However, prevalence of heterozygous mutations as well as total number of mutations (homozygous and heterozygous) was significantly higher in RPL group than in control group (40% vs 24% and 26% vs 15% respectevly, p <0,01). Each woman with RPL had at least three mutations in examined genes, while the average number of mutations in control group was 1.75. Several studies have proposed that risk for RPL may be associated with ad ditive effect of several mutations in genes involved with coagulation process rather than to some specific mutations. Our findings confirm these assump tions. Pregnancy itself represents a protrhrombotic state, which combined with multiple thrombophilic gene polymorphisms may contribute to adver se pregnancy outcome.",2014
21005,", Istanbul Medical Faculty, Istanbul, Turkey. Since trisomy 16 (T16) is a lethal chromosomal abnormality, it is very rarely diagnosed in ongoing pregnancies, even in the first trimester. We present ten new T16 cases detected in chorionic villous samples. Re ferral indication was increased first trimester screening test (FTST) risk in eight cases, with additional pathological ultrasound (US) findings in two, pathological US in one, and positive triplet test results in the other. Patholo gical US findings included intrauterine growth retardation, generalized ede ma, cystic hygroma, omphalocele, oligohydramnios, echogenic intracardiac focus, choroid plexus cyst, and hyperechogenic bowels. Combined risk of FTST in eight cases ranged between 1:2 to 1:62. PAPP A levels were decreased in six cases (range 0,05 0,29 MoM). ÃÂ²hCG levels were over 2,10 MoM in five cases. T16 was detected by karyotyping using direct preparation and/or long term cell culture (LTCC) techniques in all cases, showing mosaic status in only one. Two cases (one unsuccessful DP , and one with normal DP results) were further investigated with I FISH using centromeric chromosome 16 probe, and T16 mosaicism was demonstrated. Eight cases were followed up by amniocentesis. Mosaic T16 was detected in only one of six by karyotyping, and I FISH indicated mosaicism in four cases and normal results in two. Our results are compatible with the literature, showing that the most sen sitive screening test for T16 is the FTST , with the most reliable parameter being PAPP A. I FISH studies are helpful in the clarification of low level mo saicism in AF cells, when T16 was found in chorionic villous samples.",2014

The commercially available PrenaTestÃÂ® has been introduced in Euro pe in August 2012 and exhibits sensitivities and specificities over 99%. The laboratory experiences from routine application of NIPT are reported and test accuracy, limitations as well as patient profiles are discussed. Within the past eighteen months about 8,000 successful PrenaTestÃÂ® ana lyses have been reported, with 98.0% negative results. 1.7% were positive for trisomy 21, 0.4% positive for trisomy 18 and 0.1% positive for trisomy 13. According to ad hoc feedback from ordering specialists there were one false negative result for trisomy 18 and 13 false positive results (one T13, ten T18 and two T21) up to now. Further analysis revealed that one dis cordant positive T21 case was caused by a fetus papyraceus as determined by investigation of the placenta after birth, the other discordant T21 case was reported back by the responsible doctor as a known case of a vanishing twin. For one discordant positive T18 case, the fetus had a euploid karyo type after amniocentesis, but placental material exhibited 80% cells with trisomy 18 in FISH analysis. It is intriguing that the majority of discordant results of NIPT and invasive diagnosis seem in fact to be consequences of fetal vs. extra fetal cytogenetic discrepancies or due to undiscovered vanished twins.

Since the discovery of cell free fetal DNA in 1997 by Dennis YM Lo, the main goal was formulated a reliable method for non invasive fetal aneuploidy detection. The arrival of next generation sequencing technologies finally gave scientists a proper tool to reach this goal. Today, so called large next generation sequencing instruments are used for the so called non invasive prenatal aneuploidy testing. Few years ago, so called benchtop next genera tion sequencers were introduced, which allowed researchers worldwide to start adopting wide range of novel methods benefiting from next generation sequencing. However, they were generally considered not to be sufficiently parallel for non invasive aneuploidy test. In our study, we used one of benchtop next generation sequencers, the Mi Seq by Illumina, to test its ability to detect aneuploidy. Plasma DNA from pregnant was isolated, fragment libraries were prepared and sequenced in multiplex setup. Data was analysed using in house pipeline. A set of 20 samples (average read count 2 870 322 with SD 603 708) high risk group pregnancies with confirmed euploid fetus was used for training of our ana lysis pipeline. Analysis of testing set including 5 samples with T21 fetus re sulted in 100% specificity and 100% sensitivity. Based on our results we be lieve that performance of benchtop next generation sequencers is sufficient for non invasive prenatal aneuploidy testing. In addition, the inherently hig her flexibility of benchtop systems could be of benefit for short turnaround and low sample throughput demands.

In order to exclude a balanced rearrangement of the parents, conventional chromosome analysis was performed. The mother showed the same dupli cation as the foetus. A SNP array confirmed the cytogenetic result. The mother presented without major dysmorphic signs and showed no in tellectual disability. She had finished basic education. Pregnancy was continued due to missing ultrasound abnormalities and the inheritance of the maternal duplication.

21012,", San Carlos, CA, United States. Objective: To determine the ability of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) based non invasive prenatal testing (NIPT) to identify unrecognized vanishing twin pregnancies that could otherwise confound NIPT results. Method: 30,795 consecutive reported commercial samples that were recei ved for NIPT for fetal whole chromosomal aneuploidies; known multiple gestations were excluded. Cell free DNA was isolated from maternal blood samples, amplified, and sequenced. Sequencing results were analyzed using the NATUS algorithm to determine the fetal chromosomal copy number and presence of additional fetal haplotypes. Clinical follow up for cases with ad ditional fetal haplotypes is reported here. Results: 130 (0.42%) cases with additional fetal haplotypes were identified, indicative of fetal triploidy or molar, vanishing twin, or undetected twin pregnancy. Clinical confirmation was available for 76 cases (58.5%); inclu ding 31 (40.8%) vanishing twin, 37 (48.7%) viable twin, 2 (2.6%) molar pregnancies, 3 (3.9%) triploid pregnancies, and 3 (3.9%) non triploid preg nancies. Of the 5 vanishing twin losses with a known date of demise, 100% of losses occurred in the first trimester, and up to 8 weeks elapsed between the loss and detection by NIPT .Conclusions: This SNP based approach successfully identified previously unrecognized vanishing twin, viable twin, molar, and triploid pregnancies. Vanished twins have been identified in the literature as a significant cause of false positive results in NIPT . As vanished twins are more likely to be aneu ploid, and residual cfDNA could bias NIPT results, the unique ability of this method to identify additional fetal haplotypes has the potential to decrease the false positive rate.",2014

PCR analysis of microdeletions in the AZFa, AZFb and AZFc regions of the human Y chromosome is an important screening tool. The aim of this study was to analyse type of microdeletions in men with fertility disorders in Slovakia. We evaluated 123 patients with azoospermia and with normal karyotype. All patient samples were analyzed cytogeneti cally. For PCR amplification of sequence tagged sites (STS) of the AZFa, AZFb and AZFc regions of the Y chromosome was used Devyser AZF set. For all markers in one multiplex PCR reaction fluorescently labeled primers were used. For automated visualization and identification of the STS markers we used genetic analyzer 3500xL (Applied Biosystems). We reported 9 cases of deletions in the AZF region (7,32%).

In addition to TYR, OCA2, TYRP1, SLC45A2 , a locus in 4q25 (OCA5) and two new genes, SLC24A5 (OCA6) and C10ORF11 (OCA7) were recently discovered. Ocular (OA1) and syndromic albinism are also known. When stu dying 400 patients, we found 36 % OCA1, 25% OCA2, 2 % OCA3, 11% OCA4, 1.25% OCA6, 0% OCA7, 6% OA1 et 1% HPS1 . Deletions represent 5.6% of the anomalies. In two patients we found a complex rearrangement of OCA2 that comprised the deletion of exons 2 to 19, followed by the reinsertion, after reshuffling, of most of the deleted segment in intron 1 of the gene.17.5% of patients remain without molecular diagnosis. A first hypothesis is that mutations are located in the introns or regulatory regions of the genes. We undertook the sequencing of the entirety of the OCA1 4 genes to search for alterations not only affecting the exons. A second hypothesis is that new OCA genes remain to be discovered. We have sequenced the exome of 11 patients. In our diagnostic laboratory we have used NGS to analyze the 6 OCA, OA1 and HPS1 genes. This was efficient in terms of both finding mutations and rapidity. We are designing a larger panel including all syndromic albinism genes. The extensive analysis of all albinism genes will allow us to better characte rize gene interactions in this disease that may not be purely monogenic.",2014

Anophthalmia/microphthalmia (A/M) is a genetically heterogeneous birth defect for which the etiology remains unknown in more than 50% patients. A/M can occur without other structural eye defects (simplex A/M), or can be present with other ocular findings (complex A/M), such as anterior segment dysgenesis (ASD). We used exome sequencing (ACE ExomeTM, Personalis, Inc., 18 exomes; UCSF Genomics Core, 20 exomes; 6 were run twice) to se quence DNA from 32 children with A/M or other developmental eye defects for pathogenic mutations. In 19 patients with simplex A/M, we identified mutations in STRA6 (1 patient), RARB (1 patient; p. Arg387Cys), GDF6 (1 pa tient; p. Ala249Glu) and OTX2 (1 patient; p.

Putative causative variants were identified in 3 out of 4 patients with other developmental eye defects a homozygous mutation in GCNT2, p. Tyr347Cys, in a female with cataracts and microtia and a de novo mutation in COL4A1, p. Gly773Arg, in a female with cataracts and cardiomyopathy. In a male with a chorioretinal defect, microcephaly, seizures and sensorineural deafness, we identified a maternally inherited splice site mutation and a paternally inherited mis sense mutation, p. Ala507Ser, in PNPT1 which is critical for mRNA import into mitochondria and has not been associated with eye defects. In one child with ASD, no mutation was identified. Our overall detection rate for A/M was 6/28 (21%), illustrating high genetic heterogeneity and the need for further gene discovery.",2014
21020,"Bardet Biedl syndrome (BBS) is characterized by truncal obesity, polydac tyly, hypogonadism, developmental delay, learning disabilities, progressive retinopathy, renal disease and susceptibility to diabetes mellitus. Although BBS is mainly transmitted in an autosomal recessive manner, few families exhibit a tri allelic mode of inheritance. To date, 16 different BBS genes (BBS1 BBS16) are known and BBS1 and BBS10 show the highest mutation frequency in BBS patients. Six unrelated patients evaluated by standard ophthalmologic examination and with a clinical diagnosis of BBS were analyzed by targeted re sequencing of 130 retinopathies related genes on HiScanSQ Illumina platform (mean coverage 500X). Bioinformatic analysis identified a mean of 1100 sequence variants per sample. Filtering pipeline (exonic function, frequency, predic tion and inheritance model) leads to distil a mean of 10 candidate variants per sample. The candidate variants were independently validated by Sanger sequencing and segregation analysis was performed. We identified two known causative deletions in BBS9 (c.1877_1880del) and BBS7 (c.712_715del) genes and a novel frameshift deletion in BBS10 (c.804_805del). Morever, a patient is compound heterozygote for two novel variants in BBS10 (c.1677_1678insA and c.1220T>C); one patient present a homozygous variant in BBS2 gene (c.209A>G) and one novel heterozygous variant (c.538C>T) in BBS3 gene. The last patient has two variants in BBS12 gene both in homozygous status [c.1044del (novel) and c.61T>C (descri bed)].NGS approach has enabled us to detect variants in BBS genes.

21021,"The neuronal and cell biological mechanisms underlying vertebrate olf action have been studied in considerable detail, but there is a gap in our understanding of the molecular genetic basis of olfactory monogenic disor ders. Congenital general anosmia (CGA) affects <0.1% of the general popula tion, and appears in isolated or syndromic forms. We have recruited a large cohort of isolated CGA, with 66 affected families of Jewish origin. We applied whole exome sequencing to 43 selected individuals from 8 multiply affected families. We identified in three members of one family with a rare X linked mutation in the TENM1 (teneurin 1) gene, a neuronal signal transducer that functions in synaptic partner matching between olfactory sensory neuro nal axons and target projection neurons in drosophila. The mutation affects a highly conserved Proline residue in one of the YD domains of TENM1. In another family we identified candidate variants in the genes FGFR1 (hete rozygous mutation) and SEMA3A (heterozygous mutation). Affected indivi duals in this family obligatorily carry both mutations, suggesting a di genic model of inheritance. Both FGFR1 and SEMA3A are implicated in KallmannÃ¢ÂÂs syndrome, where GnRH neuronal migration developmental abnormalities typically lead to syndromic anosmia, associated with sterility. Our patients are unusual in having isolated anosmia. All mutations are currently under further scrutiny.

21022,"Hearing impairment is the most common sensory impairment in humans, affecting 2:1,000 births. At least 50%of the cases are inherited. Non syndro mic hereditary hearing loss accounts for the 70% of the hereditary hearing loss. It is a genetically heterogeneous disorder. The single nucleotide guanine deletion (35delG) of the GJB2 gene coding for connexin 26 was shown to be the main genetic cause of autosomal recessive deafness among Europeans. The purpose of our study was to evaluate the prevalence of GJB2 mutations among affected individuals from Turkey. To provide appropriate genetic testing and counseling to families, we searched fifty patients presenting with autosomal recessive non syndromic hearing loss from Turkey for variations in GJB2 gene by direct sequencing. Mutati ons were detected in 9 out of 28 people from 20 different families (9/28, 32 %). Four different mutations were identified; three of them were previously identified (35delG, V27I, E114G). The remaining one alleles, K221N was no vel variants which determined Ã¢ÂÂuncertain significanceÃ¢ÂÂ in different database. However, it is reported disease causing variant by Ã¢ÂÂMutation Taster Data baseÃ¢ÂÂ. The most common mutations were 35delG followed by V27I with an allele frequency of 21 and 7 %, respectively. There is no correlation between mutation types and clinical findings of patients. In conclusion, we determined GJB2 gene mutations responsible for 32 % of autosomal recessive non syndromic hearing loss in Turkish people. This is higher than earlier studies which reported that the overall frequency of GJB2 mutations in comparable families in Turkey is 18.9%.",2014
21023,"We report a boy affected by bilateral sensorineural deafness and palmo plantar hyperkeratosis. The pedigree suggests an autosomal dominant pat tern of inheritance with variable expressivity. Molecular analysis of GJB2 was negative and GJB6 deletions were also excluded. GJB6 encodes connexin 30, which is highly expressed in the inner ear and in keratinocytes. There fore, we sequenced the entire coding region of this gene in the proband and identified the c.175 G>A mutation, causing a substitution of glycine 59 with an arginine residue. The same missense mutation had been previously reported in a single patient affected by post lingual deafness and palmo plantar hyperkeratosis (Nemoto Hasebe et al, 2009). The G59R mutation affects a highly conserved amino acid, it was absent in 100 healthy ethni cally matched controls and segregates with the phenotype in our family. The analysis by molecular modelling revealed that the residue is located at the top of the channel formed by the hemiconnexons. All these findings strongly indicate a pathogenetic role for the novel variant. To explore the functional consequence of the missense mutation, we expressed the mutated version of GJB6 in HeLa cells lacking connexins. We showed that GJB6 mutated pro tein is localized to the plasma membrane only when co expressed with the wild type form. This model was employed to test the electrophysiological properties of the connexons formed by both the mutated and the wild type connexin 30.ABSTRACTS POSTERS ESHG 2014 | MILAN, ITALY | WWW. ESHG.

The lack of knowledge on the molecular basis of Normal Hearing Function (NHF) and Age related Hearing Loss (ARHL), prompted us to develop a combined multiphase strategy using approx. 3000 individuals from isolated populations of Europe, Caucasus and Central Asia. Starting from our past experience on GWAS meta analysis combined with expression studies (Gi rotto et al. 2014), the following strategy was designed: PHASE1: GWAS me ta analysis for common tag SNPs and common functional variants, PHASE2: replication in independent cohorts, PHASE3: SKAT gene based test for rare functional variants, PHASE4: Whole Exome Sequencing (WES) in a selected subgroup of 250 ARHL cases/controls. During PHASE1 the following stron gly significant associations were identified: ITFG2 (p,6.92E 11), PCDH20 (p,4.71E 10), SLC28A3 (p,2.39E 09). The last two belong to gene families already known as being involved in hearing loss and expressed in the coch lea. During PHASE2 four SNPs within the PCDH20 gene were replicated at nominal level (p<0.05) in the 1958 British Birth Cohort. Applying PHASE3, the SKAT gene based test for rare functional variants (0.001<MAF<0.05) revealed highly suggestive associations (ranging from 7.97E 06 to 1.90E 05) for the following genes: PTPRCAP , FN1, EAF1, METRNL, PDP2, ARRDC1, HDGF, TMOD1.Finally, thanks to PHASE4 (carried out in collaboration with CRG, Spain), WES data are now available to identify population disease specific rare variants.

In present study, we used targeted genomic enrichment and massively parallel sequencing to identify the cause of ARNSHL in probands from 94 families segregating recessive deafness. In eight probands, we identified MYO15A mutations as the cause of ARNSHL. Of the eight mutations, 6 were present in the homozygous state, 2 in compound heterozygous state and of them 7 were novel.

Target enrichment and sequencing was performed using the Illumina TruSeq Custom Enrichment and HiSeq2000. In total 307 variants were identified in the 124 different patients. In order to deal with the large amount of variants, a classification system was set up to assign the most plausible disease causing variant to each patient. Variants with a MAF below 0.003 were classified according to the variant type and predictions based on different prediction programs, in five groups ranging from defi nitely pathogenic (class 5) to not pathogenic/no clinical significance (class 1) at all.

Background: Hereditary sensorineural hearing impairment (HSHI) is a ge netically heterogeneous disorder worldwide. Mutations in the GJB2 gene are a frequent cause of hereditary SNHL. Individuals that are homozygous for the GJB2 gene mutations manifest a wide spectrum of clinical data that ranges from moderate to profound SNHL; this suggests the participation of epigenetic and environmental factors in the phenotypic expression Objec tive: To describe three novel homozygous mutations in the GJB2 gene with HSHI. Materials and methods: Three subjects with prelingual HSHI were in cluded in the study. Genomic DNA was extracted by conventional methods and all exons of GJB2 gene were analyzed through PCR and the DNA was sequenced on an ABI 3730XL automated sequencer.

Until now, WES has been performed with genomic DNA from affected indi viduals of two consanguineous families with profound deafness. Analysis of these data revealed a novel homozygous mutation in MYO7A gene in one family but co segregation study failed to confirm this variant as the only cause of HL in this family. Additional clinical investigation revealed that an intra familial phenotypic variation and existence of both syndromic and non syndromic HL in this family is possible. Further studies to find the other variants which may be associated with HL in this family, the data analysis of the second family and also WES of remaining families are underway.",2014

Non syndromic hearing loss (NSHL) is one of the most common hereditary diseases with incidence higher than 1:1000. It is characterized by high gene tic heterogeneity as causal mutations in more than 70 genes were found to be associated with it. Altough mutations in single gene GJB2, are the most prevalent worldwide in remaining cases screening for causal mutation will be expensive and time consuming by conventional gene by gene approach. Therefore simultaneous sequencing of multiple genes with utilization of next generation sequencing (NGS) should be the right solution. In our pilot study 5 samples with familial incidence of autosomal dominant or recessive non syndromic hearing loss without causal mutations in GJB2 gene were analyzed. The NGS was performed on IonTorrent PGM with use of customized Haloplex assay covering coding sequence of 32 most frequently mutated NSHL associated genes. In 3 of 5 cases candidate causal mutations were identified and its presence was verified with Sanger sequencing. The detected mutations were p. H455Q in KCNQ4, p. G662E in MYO1A and p. T1866M in TECTA. According to our results the multiparallel resequencing of panel of NSHL candidate genes could significantly improve genetic diagnosis of this geneti caly heterogeneous hereditary disease. Nevertheless, the lack of information about functional consequencies of low frequency variants could complicate the variant validation process and lead to false positive results.

21039,"Inherited nonsyndromic sensorineural hearing loss (NSHL) is characterized by a high level of genetic heterogeneity, making extremely challenging to obtain a molecular diagnosis with traditional screening methods. Whole exome sequencing (WES) has been recently introduced as an alternative approach to search for alleles underlying Mendelian disorders and has been successfully applied for gene/mutation discovery. In this study, we used WES to identify the pathogenic mutations responsible for NSHL in three families (NSHL6, 11, and 12), with a recessive inheritance pattern and at least two affected siblings. A total of 9 individuals were subjected to WES using the SeqCapEZ Exome capture kit (Roche) and the HiSeq 2000 sequencer (Illumi na). In particular, the NSHL6 patients were compound heterozygous for two novel mutations within the TMPRSS3 gene (DFNB8/10 locus). Both variants segregate with post lingual, bilateral, high frequency NSHL and affect evo lutionary conserved amino acids located within the TMPRSS3 catalytic do main. In the NSHL11 family, two novel missense variants were found in the heterozygous state in OTOGL, a gene that was only recently associated with NSHL (otogelin like protein, DFNB84 locus).

21040,"Pendred Syndrome (PDS) is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by progressive sensorineural hearing impairment and goiter. PDS is asso ciated with temporal bone abnormalities ranging from isolated enlargement of the vestibular aqueduct (EVA) to Mondini dysplasia. Hearing loss is pre lingual in the majority of the cases; a minority of patients has a progressive hearing loss later in life. EVA and PDS are caused by mutations in the SLC26A4 gene. The SLC26A4 gene is expressed in the non sensory epithelia of the inner ear. Additionally the genes FOXI1 and KCNJ10 may also be responsible for PDS and inner ear malformations. The FOXI1 gene is involved in the transcriptional control of the SLC26A4 gene. The KCNJ10 gene encodes for a K+ channel located in the stria vascularis. In this study we analysed 167 patients with PDS and EVA hearing loss to accomplish a phenotype genotype correlations for PDS related deafness. Individual exon and intron transitions of the SLC26A4, FOXI1 and KCNJ10 genes of patients were sequenced. Audiometric thresholds were performed, and radiologically, the vestibular aqueduct midpoint and opercular width were measured. In the analysed patients with PDS, a total of 34 different SCL26A4 mutations were detected, mutations could not be detected in 64 % of the cases. FOXI1 and KCNJ10 analyses reveal no mutation. The present results obtained in patients with PDS indicate that this pheno type is likely to be complex. Moreover, analysis of FOXI1 and KCNJ10 genes in our cohort suggests a minor implication of these two genes in the pheno type of EVA and PDS.",2014
21041,"Background: Mutations in the SLC26A4 gene cause both Pendred syndro me [sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL), enlarged vestibular aqueduct (EVA), and goiter] and autosomal recessive nonsyndromic hearing loss (ARNSHL) at the DFNB4 locus. Pendred syndrome is the most common type of syn dromic HL. Materials/Patients and Methods: We performed comprehensive clinical and genetic evaluations of 15 patients from four unrelated families from the Ardebil Province in western Iran. After testing STR markers to confirm linkage to the SLC26A4 locus, we sought to identify genetic mutations in SL C26A4 by Sanger sequencing all 21 exons, exon intron boundaries and the promoter region of this gene. Results and Conclusions: A known frameshift mutation (965insA, p. N322Fs7X) in exon 8 was identified in all four families. Three families were homozygous for this mutation and one family was compound hetero zygote (L597S/965insA). To date, this mutation has been reported only in the Iranian population, so we investigated the possibility of a founder effect. Haplotypes were constructed by genotyping seven single nucleotide poly morphisms throughout the SLC26A4 gene, thus identifying a single haplo type that co segregated with the 965insA mutation. We conclude that this mutation originates from a common founder in the west province of Iran.",2014
21042,"Perrault syndrome (PRLTS) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder characte rized by ovarian dysgenesis and premature ovarian failure (POF) in females, and by progressive hearing loss in both genders. Recently, mutations in four genes (i.e. HSD17B4, HARS2, CLPP , and LARS2) were found to be responsib le for PRLTS, although they do not account for all cases of this genetically heterogeneous condition. In this study, we used whole exome sequencing (WES) to identify the patho genic variants responsible for PRLTS in an Italian pedigree with two affected siblings (one female and one male). All five family members were subjected to WES using the SeqCapEZ Exome v2 kit (Roche) and the HiSeq2000 plat form (Illumina). Data analysis highlighted compound heterozygosity, in both patients, for two novel missense variations, p. Thr300Met (c.899C>T) and p. Glu638Lys (c.1912G>A) within LARS2, encoding the mitochondrial leucyl tRNA synthetase,. The segregation of the two mutations in the pedigree is compatible with the autosomal recessive inheritance of the disease. Both Thr300 and Glu638 residues are evolutionary conserved, and are respec tively located within the editing domain and immediately before the KMSKS sequence, a unique signature of the catalytic domain of class 1 aminoacyl tRNA synthetases. The identified mutations were confirmed to be absent in an in house database of about 3500 ethnically matched control exomes. Apart from the original report in 2013, to our knowledge, this is the first study confirming the role of LARS2 mutations in PRLTS pathogenesis.

21043,"Plateau iris configuration (PIC) is a unique subtype of angle closure glauco mas presenting in younger patients. PIC has been recognised as one of the anatomical mechanisms of angle closure development along with papillary block. The diagnosis is always based on gonioscopic and ultrasound biomi croscopy (UBM) findings. PIC associated anterior chamber characteristics include a normal central anterior chamber depth (ACD), a flat iris plane, an iris root that angles sharply forward, and anteriorly positioned or large ci liary processes. Peripheral iridotomy is proposed as a treatment. Post irido tomy complications, such as persistent angle narrowing or occlusion with intraocular pressure elevation, give rise to the plateau iris syndrome (PIS). An autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance with incomplete penetrance was proposed by Etter et al. in 2006 because of a higher prevalence of PIC in first degree family members. To our knowledge, no familial case has been reported to date. Here we described a multiplex family of seven affected members in two ge nerations. Two members have PIC and five have PIS with early onset and se vere prognosis for some of them. Whole exome sequencing was performed in five of the cases. Among the about 50 candidate variants left after filtering out by segregation, frequency and pathogenicity, the four more relevant ones according to their function were validated by Sanger sequencing in the two remaining affected members. Further experimental investigations and/or sequencing of additional families with a similar phenotype are nee ded to highlight the causative gene.",2014

Primary Open Angle Glaucoma (POAG) is the most common form of disease, affec ting 8 million people. The risk factors for POAG include genetic background. TNF alpha polymorphisms were studied in different populations regarding their influence on susceptibility of POAG. We aimed to investigate two TNF ÃÂ± polymorphisms regarding susceptibility to POAG. To our knowledge, this is the first study of TNF polymorphisms ABSTRACTS POSTERS ESHG 2014 | MILAN, ITALY | WWW. ESHG. ORG 83Back to inde x in Romanian POAG patients. We assessed 258 subjects (112 POAG patients and 146 healthy unrelated matched controls) for 857C/T (rs1799724) and 308 G/A (rs1800629) TNF alpha polymorphisms. These were genotyped by Real Time PCR (Taqman SNP Genotyping Assays C_2215707_10 and C_7514879_10 respectively, Applied Biosystems, USA). Statistical analysis was performed using the SNPStats program for genetic association studies (http://bioinfo.iconcologia.net/SNPstats); p values Ã¢ÂÂ¤0.05 were considered significant. All studied groups were in HWE for both polymorphisms. The frequencies of minor alleles 857T and 308A were similar in POAG patients and con trols (0.22/0.10 and 0.21/0.13 respectively). There was no significant diffe rence in SNPs regarding the allele carriage or genotype frequency between POAG and control subjects. Three main haplotypes were constructed with similar frequencies in patients and controls 857C/ 308G/, 857T/ 308G and 857C/ 308A: 0.683/0.661; 0.218/ 0.205 and 0.98 / 0.133 respective ly. There was no significant association between the global haplotype and POAG (p value , 0.5).Conclusion: TNF alpha polymorphisms ( 857C/T and 308G/A) seem not to influence susceptibility of POAG.

21045,"Monogenic diseases of the retina and vitreous affect approximately 1 in 2000 individuals. They are characterized by tremendous genetic heterogeneity and clinical variability of symptoms involving more than 20 different clinical phenotypes and mutations in more than 200 genes. Clinical manifestations of retinal degenerations (RD) range from mild retinal dysfunctions to seve re congenital forms. A detailed clinical diagnosis and identification of the underlying mutations are crucial for genetic counseling of affected patients and their families, for understanding genotype phenotype correlations and developing therapeutic interventions. We make use of WES and have established a reliable and efficient high throughput analysis pipeline of next generation sequencing (NGS) data to identify disease causing mutations in RD. Our data indicate that this ap proach enables us to genetically diagnose approximately 56% of the pa tients (N,28) with mutation(s) in known disease associated genes. Thus, 44% of the cases, that do not carry mutation(s) in a known gene, are cru cial for identification of novel candidate genes and biological pathways un derlying the disease phenotype. Amongst identified mutations, 47% were previously described in the literature while 53% are novel. The types of mutations included missense mutations (47.4%), frameshift insertions or deletions (26.3%), stop gains (15.8%) and mutations predicted to interfere with splicing (10.5%). In conclusion, WES can rapidly identify mutations in various families affected with different forms of RD. Functional studies of the identified mutations are needed to understand the underlying disease mechanisms, which in future might aid in the development of therapeutic approaches.",2014
21046,"In inherited retinal dystrophies (RD) genetic heterogeneity is a well known feature. Therefore, we used next generation sequencing (NGS) technology as a tool to identify known as well as unknown mutations in RD. More than 150 genes associated with RD were selected from literature or databases. A custom target in solution enrichment was used, followed by sequencing on either the SOLiD 5500xl or the Illumina HiSeq 2500 plat form. Variants were annotated using transcript, variant, medical as well as population frequency databases. Identified mutations were validated using Sanger sequencing. We analyzed 300 patients with all forms of RD including syndromic forms such as Usher syndrome and Bardet Biedl syndrome. The detection rate of solved cases was 56.7%. Interestingly, in 54% of the solved cases we were able to detect mutations which were not previously described in literature at the date of the medical report. 70% of these cases show exclusively a new mutation in case of dominant or x linked inheritance and two new mutati ons in case of recessive inheritance. 30% show one new and one previously described mutation. Therefore, we conclude that NGS is the most promising tool to identify known as well as unknown mutations for this genetically highly heteroge neous disease entity. New mutations were found in 47 different genes. Ge nes most frequently affected by mutations were USH2A and EYS followed by RPGR, PRPF31 and CDHR1 .

21047,"Retinal degenerations (RD) and other genetic diseases are often caused by splice site mutations. This type of mutation accounts for approximately 20% of all pathogenic sequence variants associated with retinal degeneration. Previously, we reported the identification of an X linked RD patient that sho wed skipping of exon 10 in the RPGR mRNA. To treat this mutation induced splice defects, we applied mutation adapted splice factors. In case of the spli ce factor U1snRNA, the adaptation yielded an increase in its affinity towards the mutated splice site. This novel gene therapeutic approach was highly efficient in increasing the amount of correctly spliced RPGR transcripts in minigene splicing assays and patient derived fibroblasts. In this study, we aimed at evaluating the efficacy of the U1 based therapy on the protein level. We established an assay to locate the RPGR protein in patient derived and control skin fibroblasts. In control fibroblasts, we found that the RPGR protein locates along the primary cilia including basal body, transition zone and axoneme. In contrast, patient derived cells showed mis localization of the RPGR protein restricted to the basal body and transition zone. Upon treatment with mutation adapted U1, localization of RPGR along the axoneme was significantly increased compared to control treatments. We conclude that the efficacy of the U1 based gene therapy is sufficient to correct not only misspliced transcripts but also their translated proteins. Thus, the adaptation of U1snRNA is a promising technique to treat patients who carry pathogenic splice defects.",2014

GRID2 encodes an ionotropic glutama te receptor known to be selectively expressed in cerebellar Purkinje cells. Here, we demonstrated GRID2 mRNA expression in human adult retina and retinal pigment epithelium. In addition, Grid2 expression was demonstrated in different stages of murine retinal development. GRID2 protein expression was observed in both murine and human retina, more specifically in photo receptor inner segments, the outer plexiform layer and ganglion cell layer.

In the highly consanguineous Saudi population, autosomal recessive forms of IRD are thought to account for the overwhel ming majority of cases. Consanguinity is known to increase the frequency of recessive disorders since it increases the coefficient of inbreeding, which is a measure of the percentage of the genome that is identical by descent. Homozygosity mapping, targeted candidate gene analysis and whole exome sequencing were used to identify the causes of IRD in the Saudi population. Mutations in RP1 were found to be a common cause of recessive RP in the Saudi population.

Retinitis pigmentosa (RP) is a heterogeneous group of inherited retinal dys trophies ultimately characterized by the loss of photoreceptors leading to blindness. The molecular diagnosis of RP has long been hampered by the lar ge genetic heterogeneity of this group of disorders. The clinical application of next generation sequencing (NGS) techniques may overcome, in part, the se limitations. In this study, we conducted whole exome sequencing (WES) to uncover the genetic cause of arRP in a consanguineous Spanish family, in which genotyping and resequencing microarrays failed to identify the gene tic defect. This strategy allowed the detection of one rare homozygous muta tion located in exon 1 of C2ORF71 gene (c.1795T>C, p. Cys599Arg). Although this variant has been previously annotated (rs377190272), it has only been detected in heterozygosity in one control individual out of 6304 exomes from the Exome Variant Server database, being probably an asymptomatic carrier. Moreover, the variant co segregated with the disease in the exten ded family and was absent in 400 matched chromosomes. Clinically, patient with mutation p. Cys599Arg shows signs of typical RP and resembles other patients with missense mutations in this gene. Taking into account the high prevalence of carriers of deleterious mutations in RP genes among the con trol population, and the growing number of experiments in which new va riants identified by exome sequencing are reported, identifying real novel mutations is an increasingly difficult task.

Molecular diagnostics for RP patients by Sanger sequencing is hampered by genetic and clinical heterogeneity. Next generation sequen cing (NGS) technology provides a new approach for RP genetic testing, allo wing for the screening of other known retinal disease genes in addition to RP genes, particularly important due to their clinical and genetic overlap.

Results: Ophthalmologic examination revealed typical features of RP in both families. In the first family a homozygous missense variant, c.3269G>A;p.(Arg1090Gln), was identified in SNRNP200, which previously was impli cated in autosomal dominant RP (adRP) and shown to impair splicing. In the second family a missense mutation, c.995G>A;p.(Gly332Asp), was iden tified in DHX38, which encodes the pre mRNA splicing factor PRP16 and previously has not been associated with arRP . The DHX38 variant shows a lod score of 3.25, which is highly suggestive of linkage. Segregation analysis indicated that both variants segregated with RP in respective families, in an autosomal recessive manner. In silico analysis supported the causality of the p.(Arg1090Gln) and p.(Gly332Asp) variants. Conclusions: Since the SNRNP200 variant p.(Arg1090Gln) appears only to be causative when present homozygously, we hypothesize that it is a hypo morphic mutation.

Results: the exon 2 fragment of RS1 gene failed to amplify in the proband; given the strong suspicion of a dele tion a confirmation was made by MLPA and SNP array: all affected males were positive for exon 2 deletion of RS1 gene. Carrier females were also identified. SNP array analysis showed a deletion of less than 7 kb including exon 2. Conclusion: this is the first report of a deep characterization of a whole exon deletion in the RS1 gene, accounting in 10% of XLRS.

21057,"One of the most common genetic diseases in human is hearing loss (HL). The majority of cases are nonsyndromic (70%) and 1 5% are nonsyndromic X linked. Most cases are due to mutations in a single gene. Nevertheless, DNA diagnostics for hearing loss are challenging, since it is an extremely hetero geneous trait. Although more than 70 causative genes have been described for the nonsyndromic hearing loss alone, diagnostic application of the sci entific progress has lagged behind. Some previous reports have shown that Ã¢ÂÂnext generation DNA sequencing techniquesÃ¢ÂÂ have the potential to offer a novel testing platform that could test all known genes in a sensitive, specific and cost efficient manner. In this study, whole exome sequencing (WES) for direct genetic diagnosis in NSHL was used.

Orsola Malpighi Hospital, University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy. 11ÃÂ hydroxylase deficiency (11ÃÂ OHD) represents the second most com mon cause of Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia (CAH). It is caused by muta tions in the CYP11B1 gene localized in 8q21, 40 kb distant from its highly homologous CYP11B2 gene codifing for aldosterone synthase. Pathologi cal alleles derived from the asymmetric recombination of these two genes have been described. The formation of a chimeric CYP11B2/CYP11B1 gene leads to 11ÃÂ OHD; instead the chimeric CYP11B1/ CYP11B2 gene causes the glucocorticoid remediable aldosteronism (GRA). As the detection of these rearrangement is still laborious or indirect, our objective was to project a synthetic probe set for multiplex ligation dependent probe amplification (MLPA) analysis in order to simplify the detection of these chimeric genes and other variation in the copy number of these genes. We disegned a set of 8 specific probes for both CYP11B1 and CYP11B2 genes to be used with the commercial control kit SALSA MLPA P300 Human DNA reference (MRC Hol land). The methods was tested on 15 control samples and then applied to 6 patients with the suspition of 11ÃÂ OHD. The analysis with the CYP11 probe set has led to the identification of one copy number variation in an adult pa tient with adrenal rests misdiagnosed as 21 hydroxylase deficiency and not properly treated. He resulted compound heterozygous for a novel chimeric CYP11B2/CYP11B1 gene, with the breakpoint region locolized within intron 2, and the known A306V mutation.

21060,"ADPKD is the most common genetic nephron pathology in humans, af fecting about 1/1000 individuals. Aim of the present work was to define genetic variation of PKD1 and PKD2 in Italian patients affected by ADPKD. Analysis of PKD1 and PKD2 variation would allow to: confirm the diagno sis in clinically uncertain/atypical cases; offer genetic counseling in at risk families; exclude the presence of a mutation in related donors for kidney transplantation; define gene variability in Italian patients. 576 subjects has been analyzed with a semi automated Sanger protocol: 298 unrelated pati ents belonging to families and 171 relatives; 72 patients with no familiarity and 35 cases with no data about familiarity. In 90% of the 405 probands, variants were present: PKD1 80%; PKD2 4%; PKD1+PKD2 6%. 84.5% of the identified variants have never been described. An average of 12 SNPs/pati ent in PKD1 and 2 SNPs/patient in PKD2,was observed. By combining re sults for truncating and known variants we classified variants as pathogenic in 65.4% (265/405) of patients. For unclassified variants, a prediction was attempted according to PKDB criteria. Concordance of the results obtained with SIFT , AGVGD and PolyPhen2 allowed calling of 18 likely neutral and 12 highly likely pathogenic variants.

21061,"Background: Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease (ADPKD) pa tients carry a germline mutation in PKD1 or PKD2 , leading to thousands of kidney cysts. It is poorly understood why a rapid progression of the disease is preceded by a lag phase of several decades. Studies in which Pkd1 is inac tivated in large percentages of cells in animal models, led to the presump tion that inactivation of the remaining allele initiates cystogenesis, and that the progression can be accelerated by renal injury. To mimic human ADPKD, we lowered this percentage and found important characteristics of cysto genesis that have not been described before. Methods: The percentage of Pkd1 deficient cells in Tamoxifen inducible kidney specific Pkd1 deletion mice was controlled by varying the tamoxifen dose, visualized with repor ter mice and quantified by eMLPA. Several renal injuries were applied. Cyst progression was followed by MRI analysis and PKD related signaling was analyzed by Immuno histochemistry. Results: Interestingly, no pathologi cal changes occurred for six months after scattered Pkd1 deletion and re nal injury did not trigger rapid PKD. However, in the following 3 4 months, clustered cyst formation led to a severe human like PKD phenotype. This shift was preceded by increased pSTAT3, pCREB, pERK1/2, LCN2 and Ki 67 expression near the initial cysts. Conclusions: Our data argue against the presumption that renal injury is the major trigger for cystogenesis but suggests that initial cysts themselves, by imposing persistent stress on sur rounding tissue, triggers a Ã¢ÂÂsnow ballÃ¢ÂÂ effect driving the formation of new cysts. In addition, our model mimics human ADPKD more precisely and can be used for pre clinical testing.",2014

The gene encoding AAT is the highly polymorphic SERPINA1 gene, found at 14q32.1. Mutations in the SERPINA1 gene can lead to AAT deficiency (AATD) which is associated with a substantially increased risk of lung and liver disease. The most common pathogenic AAT variant is Z (Glu342Lys) which causes AAT to misfold and polymerise within hepatocytes and other AAT producing cells. A group of rare mutations causing AATD, termed Null or Q0, are characte rised by a complete absence of AAT in the plasma.

21063,"Chromosome microarray (CMA) analysis typically focuses on coding DNA (RefSeq and OMIM genes). Although non coding intergenic and intronic va riants may be critical in disease pathogenesis, copy number variants (CNV) in these regions are usually interpreted as variants of unknown clinical significance. We present a case of a lethal neonatal condition in which the pathogenic CNV lies in a distant, upstream non coding region. It highlights the importance of relevant clinical information for CMA interpretation, and the importance of the analysis of flanking regions if an identified CNV does not initially appear pathogenic. A term female, with a prenatal diagnosis of AVSD, presented with severe neonatal respiratory distress out of keeping with her cardiac issues. The clinical picture and early lethality suggested congenital surfactant deficiency (CSD). Sequencing of a CSD gene panel was normal. CMA analysis revealed a de novo 1.5 Mb deletion at 16q24.1. None of the 16 RefSeq genes mapping within the deleted region appeared cau sative. However, this deletion is located 157 kb upstream of FOXF1, a gene responsible for congenital alveolar capillary dysplasia with misalignment of pulmonary veins (ACDMPV). The observed deletion encompasses a recently characterized distant regulator/enhancer of the FOXF1 gene. The pathologi cal diagnosis of ACDMPV was confirmed posthumously.

21064,"Background Polycystic kidney disease (PKD ) can be inherited as an auto somal dominant (ADPKD ) or an autosomal recessive trait (ARPKD) . ADPKD is one of the most common genetic diseases in humans affecting all ethnic groups worldwide with an incidence of 1 in 500 to 1 in 1,000. ADPKD is ge netically heterogeneous and can arise from mutations in two genes, named PKD1 and PKD2 . Mutations of PKD1 located on chromosome 16p13.3 are responsible for 85% of cases. Aim Although there is no hotspots reported in PKD1 , most mutations are seen in the downstream exons of this gene. So, we developed a clinical assay for PKD1 gene analysis using sequencing of 16 exons from 31 to 46 in 22 patients. Material and Method This study was carried out with a total of 22 patients. Genomic DNA was extracted from blood lymphocytes (5ml of whole blood) with standard methods and frag ments were amplify using PCR. Screening of PKD1 mutations was performed by direct Sequencing. Result Sequencing result of exons 44 and 45 showed one completely pathogenic mutation causing Gln4005Arg change. Two no vel non synonymous variation including Arg4091Glu and Val4035Ilu and five likely neutral SNP including rs10960, rs3087632, rs3087632, rs10960, rs3087632, rs3087632 are detected.

21065,"Autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease (ARPKD) is a severe form of PKD with typical occurrence in neonates and infants. It is characterized by cystic dilations of the collecting ducts and congenital hepatic fibrosis. Peri natal mortality has been estimated to account 30 50% of ARPKD neonates and the majority of patients develop renal failure within 5 years, however presentation of ARPKD at later age and survival into adulthood have been also described. The aim of this work was to establish molecular diagnostics of ARPKD which could be used in Ã¢ÂÂat riskÃ¢ÂÂ families, as fetal ultrasonography has limited reliability in early pregnancy and some abnormalities typical for ARPKD become evident after 20 weeks of gestation. ARPKD is caused by mutations in PKHD1, whose longest transcript comprises 67 exons. Con ventional mutational detection methods are therefore time consuming and relatively expensive. For this reason next generation sequencing has been chosen as a suitable method. After the setting up of NGS for PKHD1 gene, the analysis of 9 infants/children and 1 fetus from interrupted pregnancy, all with clinically suspected ARPKD, was carried out. Two mutations were found in 5 patients and one mutation in 3 patients. No mutation was iden tified in two patients, which could be caused by misdiagnosis. Interesting combination of p. G2705fsX and p. S2861G in cis appeared 3 times in our group of patients.

The intricate interplay between genetic background and environmental factors is believed to be at the basis of this progressive disea se leading to chronic kidney failure and associated with high incidence of upper urinary tract uroepithelial cancer. DNA methylation is the most studied primary epigenetic mechanism that is involved in processes such as cancer, genomic imprinting, tissue differentia tion etc. Epigenetic alterations could be a major contributing factor to BENÃ¢ÂÂs elusive etiopatogenesis. ÃÂÃÂ°terials and methods: We performed whole genome DNA methylation ana lysis on DNA blood samples from 159 affected individuals and 170 healthy controls assigned to 8 DNA pools based on gender and ancestral origin (Bul garian and Serbian). After determining the methylation status of ca.27000 CpG islands throughout the whole genome (Agilent DNA methylation array 1x244k) we defined the differently methylated regions (DMRs) between patients groups and respective control groups. We then compared DMRs across different ancestral and gender groups. Results: Analysis of the common DMRs between patient control pairs re vealed that genes involved in major biological processes appear to be af fected in BEN cell adhesion and cytoskeleton organization/regulation of cell cycle 14.8% of DMRs in both Bulgarians(BG)/Serbians(SER), carci nogenesis and metastasis 7.41%(BG)/8.8%(SER) and immune response 14.8%(BG)/6.4%(SER) respectively.

The results of molecular biological investigations propose that BEN is a multifactorial disease with genetic predisposition to environmental risk agents. Exome sequencing of 22 000 genes with Illumina Nextera Exome Enrichmen kit was performed on 22 DNA samples (11 Bulgarian patients and 11 Ser bian patients). Software analysis was performed via NextGene, Provean and PolyPhen. The frequency of all annotated genetic variants with deleterious/damaging effect was compared with those of European populations. Then we focused on non annotated variants (with no data available about them and not found in healthy Bulgarian controls).There is no statistically significant difference between annotated variants in BEN patients and European populations. From non annotated variants with more than 40% frequency in both patientsÃ¢ÂÂ groups, we nominated 3 genes with possible deleterious/damaging variants CELA1, HSPG2 and KCNK5.Mutant genes (CELA1, HSPG2 and KCNK5) in BEN patients encode proteins involved in basement membrane/extracellular matrix and vascular tone, tightly connected to process of angiogenesis.

Of 82 patients with Coffin Siris syndrome carrying an ARID1B variant and examined for renal anomalies that have been described in the literature to date, 6 (7%) presented with a non severe CAKUT phenotype. The causative ARID1B mutations detected in patients with Coffin Siris syndrome so far were all heterozygous trunca ting variants. Here, we report a rare homozygous ARID1B missense variant detected by whole exome sequencing in a patient with bilateral cystic dys plastic kidneys, bilateral vesicoureteral reflux grade IV, and a septal myo cardial tumor. Stage 4 chronic kidney disease was diagnosed at 6 months of age, arterial hypertension developed, and pre emptive kidney transplan tation was performed at age 3.5 years.

However, unlike all patients with heterozygous truncating ARID1B mutations, our patient had normal intelligence. Interestingly, whole exome sequencing also revealed a rare deleterious heterozygous MTOR missense variant inherited from a healthy mother in our patient. mTOR is regulated by TSC1/TSC2, encoded by genes that when mutated can cause tuberous sclerosis associated with renal cystic disease and myocardial tumors.

Most patients are sporadic, however some CIPO cases show a fa milial clustering suggesting genetic components. The aim of this study was to identify a CIPO cause in a consanguineous family with several affected members. Results: Whole exome sequencing in the affected individuals revealed a novel homozygous mutation, p.622 Ala>Thr in RAD21, cohesin complex subunit regulating cell replication and gene expression. RAD21 screening in 33 sporadic CIPO patients did not show coding mutations. RUNX1 expression, a RAD21 target, was decreased in the patientÃ¢ÂÂs cell line. Rad21 morpholino knockdown in zebrafish embryos resulted in incomplete or absent expression of Runx1 , in severe reduction of enteric neurons and delayed intestinal transit. These defects could be rescued only by wild type Rad21 cDNA, indicating that the mutation found in the CIPO pedigree extin guishes RAD21 functionality. Several binding sites for RAD21 were present in apolipoprotein A/C gene cluster and its altered binding to the regions dysregulated apolipoprotein expression levels. We studied APOB promoter and identified two RAD21 putative binding sites. EMSA assays showed that RAD21 wild type, but not mutant, binds these regions. We therefore measu red APOB protein levels that were increased in all CIPO patients, including the syndromic patient carrying the RAD21 mutation.

Studies of familial FSGS have been instrumen tal in identifying podocytes as critical elements in maintaining glomerular function. Exome sequencing in members of an index family with dominant FSGS revealed a nonconservative, disease segregating variant in the PAX2 transcription factor gene. Sequencing in probands of a familial FSGS cohort revealed seven rare and private heterozygous single nucleotide substitu tions (4% of cases). Further sequencing revealed seven private missense variants (8%) in a cohort of individuals with congenital abnormalities of the kidney and urinary tract (CAKUT). As predicted by in silico structural modeling analyses, in vitro functional studies documented that several of the FSGS associated PAX2 mutations perturb protein function by either af fecting proper binding to DNA and transactivation activity, or altering the interaction of the transcription factor with repressor proteins, resulting in enhanced repressor activity. Thus mutations in PAX2 contribute to adult onset FSGS in the absence of overt extrarenal manifestations. We expand the phenotypic spectrum associated with PAX2 mutations, which have been shown to lead to CAKUT as part of papillorenal syndrome. PAX2 mutations can cause disease through haploinsufficiency and dominant negative effects, which could have implications for tailoring individualized drug therapy in the future.",2014

Hirschsprung disease (HSCR) is a disorder of the enteric nervous system (ENS) and is characterized by the absence of enteric neurons along a va riable length of the intestine. HSCR most commonly presents sporadically, although it is familial in 5 20% of the patients. The sporadic form of the disorder is believed to be a genetically complex disease. To assess the role of de novo mutations in sporadic HSCR, we performed exome sequencing on 20 HSCR patients, predominantly females with long segment HSCR and their unaffected parents. We identified and confirmed 24 de novo mutations (18 SNVs, 6 Indels) in 17 different genes (1.2 per trio). Non synonymous de novo mutations were identified in RET in 8 out of 20 patients, corroborating previous findings that RET is the major genetic contributor in long segment HSCR. A replication study in independent HSCR patients, gene burden tests and functional analysis in both cell lines and zebra fish are currently being conducted. Interestingly, some of the ge nes harboring de novo mutations are members of pathways involved in the development of the ENS and the encoded proteins interact with known key signaling molecules. We will present all data which will enable us to make conclusion on whether, de novo mutations in genes other that RET also con tribute to the development of sporadic HSCR.",2014

Hirschsprung disease (HSCR) is a majority cause of chronic constipation in children. HSCR is an inherited disease and germline mutations are fre quently identified in RET and EDNRB. However, defining causality of mu tations in this genetic complex disorder is difficult. Therefore, in this study we combined sequence analysis of RET and EDNRB with functional studies to determine causality. We screened a total of 61 HSCR children and iden tified 8 rare RET coding variants (R79W, R144H, P270L, R694Q, A756V, G533S, Y1062C,D489N) and one possible splice site variant. No rare variant in EDNRB were identified. The mutation frequency (15%) is comparable to previous studies. Four missense variants and one possible spice site variant have never been reported before. Four of the nine arose de novo, while the remaining variants are all inherited from an unaffected parent. One patient harbor two RET coding variants, one coming from each unaffected parent. Functional studies showed that 7 out of 8 coding RET variants resulted in significant lower expression of the phosphorylated RET protein. Only 4 RET variants (R144H, R694Q, A756V, Y1062C) resulted in significantly lower expression of phosphorylated ERK, a downstream component of the RET pathway, when compare to wild type RET . The possible splice site variant (IVS 1880 4A>G) did not disturb the splicing process and, therefore, is not considered pathogenic. Our data suggest that 7 of the 9 identified RET vari ants are pathogenic and that not all rare RET variants are pathogenic, hence functional studies are essential to prove pathogenicity.",2014
21076,"The recent improvements of next generation sequencing techniques allow relatively rapid and cheap identification of new gene mutations in patients with familial hypomagnesemia. However, translating the genetic findings into functional assays to examine the function of the affected genes remains challenging because of inadequate cell models, the absence of an Mg2+ ra dioisotope and limited availability of animal models. For example, we have identified new mutations in the gene CNNM2 in five families suffering from mental retardation, seizures, and hypomagnesemia. For the first time, a recessive mode of inheritance of CNNM2 mutations was observed and mutations in CNNM2 are associated with mental disability. Using stable Mg2+ isotopes, we demonstrated that CNNM2 increases cel lular Mg2+ uptake in HEK293 cells and that this process occurs through regulation of the Mg2+ permeable cation channel TRPM7. In contrast, cells expressing mutated CNNM2 proteins did not show increased Mg2+ uptake. Knockdown of cnnm2 isoforms in zebrafish resulted in disturbed brain de velopment and reduced body Mg content. These phenotypes were rescued by injection of mammalian wild type Cnnm2 cRNA, whereas mammalian mutant Cnnm2 cRNA did not improve the zebrafish knockdown phenotypes. Altogether these data show that CNNM2 is fundamental for brain develop ment, neurological functioning and Mg2+ homeostasis. By establishing a novel Mg2+ transport assay using stable Mg2+ isotopes and the loss of function zebrafish model, we provide a unique system to ex amine the function of novel genes in Mg2+ homeostasis. These new in vitro and in vivo models may aid to explain the function of electrolyte transpor ters in the future.",2014
21077,"By definition, complex diseases are caused by many different genes, but this might hold true only at the population level. We hypothesize that within fa milies with a high disease burden, complex diseases can arise from only a few high effect risk variants. Assuming that all or most affected family mem bers share the genomic region(s) that harbor the risk variant(s), whole ge nome sequencing is the most precise method for determination of identical by descent segments to narrow down the search space for disease genes. Family genomics is especially powerful in multi generation pedigrees. In some of the pedigrees we analyze diseased individuals are separated by more than 10 meioses each of which narrows the number of candidate alle les by approximately half, per MendelÃ¢ÂÂs law of segregation. Family genomics furthermore permits identification of sequencing errors and detection of rare variants with high confidence. In addition to our identical by descent detection tools we have created an analysis workflow to identify and score variants according to their inheri tance pattern, population frequency and predicted function. We are current ly analyzing over 200 families in over 30 studies that cover a wide range of diseases, from rare congenital diseases to common neurodegenerative and chronic inflammatory diseases. We present here our methods for identifying high confidence candidate variants for inflammatory bowel disease in fami lies with high disease burden. ABSTRACTS POSTERS ESHG 2014 | MILAN, ITALY | WWW.

21078,"Congenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract (CAKUT) comprise a range of structural malformations and constitute the principal cause of end stage renal disease in children. Although several genes have been linked to CAKUT pathogenesis, the genetic background remains unclear in many patients. We performed whole exome sequencing in the patientÃ¢ÂÂs DNA (Su reSelect, Agilent / SOLiD5500Ã¢ÂÂ¢ System, Life Technologies). Through whole exome sequencing we identified a novel hemizygous dinucleotide frames hift deletion in the X linked retinitis pigmentosa GTPase regulator (RPGR) gene of a male patient with unilateral kidney dysplasia. This mutation was confirmed through Sanger sequencing and was found to be inherited from the mother. Mutations in RPGR are frequently reported in patients with pro gressive retinal degeneration, however its potential role in kidney pathoge nesis has not previously been observed. At present, we investigate the effect of RPGR dysfunction on kidney development in vivo, by generating zebrafish mutants using transcription activator like effector nucleases (TALENs). Sub sequently, complementation assays will be performed to study the specific effect of the human RPGR mutation in this vertebrate system. Also, we aim to characterize both wild type and mutant RPGR in vitro, using patient derived cell lines isolated from urine and IMCD3 (murine inner medullary collecting duct) 3D cellular spheroids. To conclude, by identifying novel players in the aetiology of CAKUT , we will enhance our knowledge on the molecular net works underlying normal and disrupted kidney development. Identification of the genetic aetiology of CAKUT will improve DNA diagnostics and genetic counselling for CAKUT patients.",2014
21079,"Introduction: With the advent of high resolution ultrasound scanners and the offer of a 20 week ultrasound scan to all pregnant women in Denmark, a suspicion of abnormal kidneys in the fetus is raised more frequently now than earlier. The prognosis of a fetus with abnormal kidneys is often not known, which complicates decision making and causes anxiety to parents. Methods: A population based cohort of fetuses diagnosed with abnormal kidneys in the period 1st of January 2007 31st of December 2012 and a population based matched comparison cohort of foetuses examined in the 20 week screening programme were established. A national query identified fetuses with cystic kidneys, echogenic kidneys, multicystic kidneys, renal agenesia and/or severe hydronephrosis. Severe hydronephrosis was included in the query to avoid missing cases of multi cystic kidneys, as the primary finding may have been interpreted as hydro nephrosis. All Danish departments of obstetrics and fetal medicine use the same soft ware for prenatal diagnostics and ultrasound examination. These data were merged into a national dataset of around 1000 pregnancies. Prenatal fetal data were linked to their mothersÃ¢ÂÂ data using the mothersÃ¢ÂÂ civil registration numbers. This allows unambiguous individual level linkage to all relevant data sources in Denmark, including the Danish National Patient Registry and medical journals. Results: The prevalence of the various types of abnormal fetal kidneys, the prevalence of terminated pregnancies and measures of prognosis will be discussed. This study may facilitate that parents having a fetus with kidney abnormalities can be counselled based on valid and comprehensive data on prognosis.",2014
21080,"Congenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract (CAKUT) comprise a spectrum of structural malformations. CAKUT occur in 1:500 live births and form the most common cause of end stage renal failure in children. We aim to identify rare mutations in CAKUT candidate genes and elucidate involve ment in CAKUT aetiology. After in solution enrichment (SureSelect, Agilent), 208 candidate genes were sequenced (SOLiD5500 TM, Life Technologies) in 460 sporadic CAKUT patients. All genes were known to play a role in human CAKUT or to disrupt nephrogenesis in animal models. We demonstrated coverage depth of 120X and 65% enrichment efficiency on average. After variant calling, filtering was performed based on sequencing depth (Ã¢ÂÂ¥15X) and allele frequency, excluding common variants. We identified 47 indels, 20 nonsense, 22 essential splice site mutations, as well as 150 novel missense variants in 82 genes that were predicted to be pathogenic. Of these, 71 va riants in 39 genes were previously reported in The Human Gene Mutation Database as causal mutations for kidney related disorders. The variants are currently being validated in patients and parents by Sanger sequencing. Pre liminary data show that the majority of variants are inherited, except for a well known frameshift variant in PAX2 and a novel variant in LZTS2 , which occurred de novo. We conclude that our approach provides knowledge on the frequency of known disease causing mutations and underlines the hete rogeneity of CAKUT . Results indicate the value of including novel genes in an NGS based genetic test for CAKUT , facilitating early diagnostics and genetic counselling for CAKUT patients and their relatives.",2014

For decades, clinically ill defined autosomal dominant renal diseases ori ginating from tubular cells and leading to tubular atrophy and interstitial fibrosis were reported. Patients exhibit mutations in at least 4 genes: UMOD, HNF1B, REN, MUC1, but are clinically indistinguishable all associated with renal fibrosis and renal failure the 3rd and 6th decade of life. In contrast to what the frequently used term Ã¢ÂÂMedullary Cystic Kidney DiseaseÃ¢ÂÂ (MCKD) implies, development of medullary cysts is neither an early, nor a typical feature, as analyzed by MRI. We now investigated 10 such families. In two large families we performed genome wide linkage and haplotype analyses confirming linkage to a known 3.4 Mb locus MCKD1 locus on chromosome 1q21. Targeted genomic sequen cing of the complete linkage locus in affected and healthy individuals of the se two families and affected individuals of further families failed to uncover any segregating variant in any of the genes, including MUC1. The VNTR regi on in the coding sequence of the MUC1 was masked in these analyses due to its high GC content and repetitive nature. After the recent publication of one MUC1 VNTR insertion mutation we established SNaPshot minisequencing confirming this MUC1 mutation in 4 families. Further 3 families carried an UMOD mutation, leaving 3 families unsolved to date. On the basis of clinical and pathological characteristics we propose the term Ã¢ÂÂ Autosomal Dominant Tubulointerstitial Kidney DiseaseÃ¢ÂÂ (ADTKD) as a new name for this entity.

Medullary sponge kidney (MSK) is a rare, developmental congenital disease characterized by diffuse ectasia or dilation of precalyceal collecting tubules. It is generally considered a sporadic disorder, but an apparently autosomal dominant inheritance has also been observed. The diagnosis of MSK is ra diographic: typical pictures reveal collections of contrast medium in dilated papillary ducts, giving the appearance of a blush or linear striations in the mildest cases, or of bouquets of flowers when cystic dilation of the coll ecting ducts is seen. We previously described the association of MSK with mutations in ATP6V1B1 and ATP6V0A4, responsible of distal renal tubular acidosis (dRTA), a condition characterized by hypokalemia, hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis, nephrocalcinosis, nephrolithiasis, osteomalacia and rik kets. In this disorder the ÃÂ± intercalated cells in the collecting duct are unable to secrete H+ and to acidify urine. The aim of our study was to investigate, on the basis of family history and clinical presentation at various ages, the relationship between MSK and dRTA: we studied first the possible role of the B1 and a4 apical subunits of the H+ATPase pump (at present 8 patients show pathogenetic variations in these two subunits) and afterwards whe ther other genes could be causative of this condition. We investigated, by high throughput sequencing, 25 patients classified as having MSK and we studied, in addition to the role of the above mentioned genes, other genes encoding proteins expressed in the tubules and genes implicated in the coll ecting duct system development. We will show the results of this new pilot study.",2014

Genetic testing for MODY has become a routine procedure allowing to set up proper treatment and discri minate from type 2 diabetes (T2D) whose symptoms are often overlapping. We analysed, in the last 5 years, more than 300 Italian families with MODY/T2D diagnosis by direct sequencing of genes GCK, HNF1ÃÂ±, HNF4ÃÂ±, IPF1 and HNF1ÃÂ², and only about 40% of the cases resulted positive. Mutations in GCK gene account for up to 80% for all Italian MODY cases according to literature data. We then reanalysed the negative subjects through Next Generation Sequen cing technology. We excluded common, non coding and synonymous gene variants, and performed in depth analysis on filtered sequence variants in a pre defined set of 102 genes implicated in glucose metabolism. We found, in association with known heterozygous SNPs associated with diabetes, rare and pathogenetic variants, demonstrating that this approach leads to a ge netic diagnosis in most of patients. For example, we identified new variants in the RFX6 gene and in two of these cases we also detected rare variants in WFS1 and ABCC8.

Molecular diagnostic analysis of hetero geneous renal disorders has long been hampered by the size and numbers of genes involved, but has become feasible with the advent of Next Generation Sequencing (NGS). We set up and implemented an NGS based test in our ISO15189 certified laboratory to enrich and sequence 376 genes known to be causal in or associated with kidney and urinary tract disorders. Based on the enrichment 23 disease related genepanels covering 175 genes were formed, including renal cysts (50 genes), Bardet Biedl syndrome (14 genes), Joubert syndrome (21 genes), nephronophthisis (15 genes), congenital ano malies of the kidney and urinary tract (40 genes) and nephrotic syndrome (16 genes).

There are important unexplai ned inter individual variations in the incidence and severity of acute pan creatitis episodes in LPLD patients. Several genes involved in proteolytic networks are associated with pancreas and lipoprotein functions and could influence pancreatitis risk in LPLD. Objective: To evaluate the association between two genes regulating serine proteases, chymotrypsin C (CTRC) and serine peptidase inhibitor kazal type1 (SPINK1 ), and recurrence of hospita lizations for acute pancreatitis among LPLD subjects. Methods: CTRC and SPINK1 have been sequenced in a sample of 38 LPLD patients and 100 con trols. In LPLD, 18 (47%) presented a history of recurrent (Ã¢ÂÂ¥5) hospitalizati ons for acute and severe abdominal pain, whereas 8 (21%) had not yet been hospitalized for this condition. Comparisons between studied groups were done with chi square tests and multinominal regression analyses. Results: Gene sequencing identified 15 SNPs. Genotype stratified analyses in LPLD subjects and controls suggested an epistasic association between rs545634 (CTRC) and rs11319 (SPINK1) SNPs combination and recurrence of hospita lizations (p<0.001) in LPLD. Regression analyses, controlling for age, gender and smoking status, suggest that the risk of frequent and recurrent hospita lizations for acute pancreatitis is significantly increased in LPLD in presence of this CTRC SPINK1 SNPs combination (OR , 41.4 [CI: 2.0 848.0]; p ,0.016). Conclusion: These results suggest that modifier genes involved in protease pathways could influence the trajectory of pancreatitis risk in LPLD.",2014

ResultsMost pathogenic mutations were identified in ABCB11 (56%), followed by ATP8B1 (32%) and ABCB4 (12%); including 73% missense mutations, 17% truncating mutations, 7% splice mutations and 3% small deletions. Response to pharmacological therapy was insufficient in 87% of patients, thus, biliary diversion and/or liver transplantation was performed in 75%.

Perioperative complications observed in patients with missense mutati ons were mild and included bleeding and coagulation problems (n,2). Life threatening complications (organ rejection requiring retransplantation, death) occurred in two patients with at least one truncating ABCB11 muta tion. Severe long term complications were observed in 3 ATP8B1 mutations carriers including severe diarrhea, renal failure, deafness and polyneuro pathy.

Despite the advances in the study of PHP molecular determinants, about 30% of patients still lack a molecular diagnosis and, in the last years, inde pendent groups found in a subset of PHP/AHO patients causative defects classically associated to diseases with partially common phenotype, such as deletions of 2q37.2 associated with the AHO like syndrome (or brachydac tyly mental retardation syndrome, BDMR).In this study, we screened by a multiplex ligand dependent probe amplifica tion (MLPA) assay targeting the chromosome region 2q our series of AHO/PHP pts negative for GNAS defects (n,56) and we detected 3 different de letions of 2q37, overlapping but smaller than those previously described.

In order to determine the cause of PPDS, we performed whole exome se quencing (WES) in a family with two children affected with hypothyroidism, developmental delay, positive perchlorate test and absence of inner ear mal formation on CT scan. Parents were healthy and non consanguineous and direct sequencing of SLC26A4 was normal in both patients. WES was performed in both patients and their father. Variants were ranked by segregation, allele frequency, protein change and degree of conservation to assess likelihood of causation. Both patients were found to be compound heterozygous for missense mutations (Y453D and W233C) in TPO and the father was heterozygous for the Y453D mutation. In silico prediction tools determined a deleterious mutational impact of both variants on protein function. Sanger sequencing confirmed the muta tion segregation and found that the mother was heterozygous W233C. The latter mutation was novel and both were absent in the control population. TPO encodes thyroperoxidase which catalyzes key reactions in thyroid hormone synthesis and mutations in TPO are responsible for thyroid dy shormonogenesis 2A. Mutations in TPO have been reported in 4 patients with hypothyroidism and deafness in a series of Israeli patients with iodide organification defect (Tenenbaum Rakover, 2007) but their phenotype was not described as PPDS. These cases together with the present report suggest that mutations in TPO can be responsible for pseudo PDS.",2014

The findings suggest that not only a loss of function mutation of URAT1 but also the dominant negative effect cause renal hy pouricemia via loss of uric acid absorption, partly due to protein misfolding caused by accumulation of URAT1 protein in the endoplasmic reticulum.

SHORT syndrome is defined by its acronym: short stature (S), hyperextensi bility of joints and/or inguinal hernia (H), ocular depression (O), Rieger ab normality (R) and teething delay (T). We and others recently identified the PIK3R1 gene, encoding for the regulatory subunits of phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase (PI3K) and playing a key role in insulin signaling, as responsible of SHORT syndrome. In total, 22 cases with a PIK3R1 and a variable phenotype have been reported. Only 15/22 patients presented at least 3 of 5 signs of the SHORT acronym. Indeed, the Rieger abnormality was found in less than half patients (8/21), but other ophthalmological manifestations such as hyper metropia can be present. Hyperextensibility of joints and/or inguinal hernia (3/18) were also rarely reported. At contrary, some features not part of the acronym are found at a high frequency: facial dysmorphism was typical with enophtalmia (20/20), lipodystrophy (19/19), insulin resistance (11/12), as well as diabetes mellitus in adolescence or adulthood (8/11). In conclusion, clinical reappraisal of SHORT syndrome at the light of the PIK3R1 gene dis covery permitted to revise the diagnostic criteria for SHORT syndrome. The presence of lipodystrophy and insulin resistance permit to classify SHORT syndrome among the rare syndromic forms of insulin resistance.",2014

Moreover, albuminuria and eGFR reduc tion are independent predictors of CVD. The aim of this study is to explore the relationship between SNPs and CVD and impaired renal function phenotype in Verona Newly Diagnosed type 2 Diabetes Study (VNDS) patients. We studied 45 CVD and 44 eGFR and/or CKD predictors SNPs in 529 GAD Ab negative subjects, (meanÃÂ±SEM age: 58.8ÃÂ±0.41 years; BMI: 30.0ÃÂ±0.22 kg/m2; FPG: 7.17ÃÂ±0.08 mmol/L; HbA1c: 6.86ÃÂ±0.05%). The association analysis was performed on 5 phenotypes: 3 CVD phenotypes (carotid arteries ultra sound, lower limb arterial ultrasound, ECG) and 2 kidney disease pheno types (eGFR, microalbuminuria). For both genetic risks was generated a ge netic load score (GLS), by summing up the number of risk alleles carried by each patient. Both GLS were considered in the analysis as natural values and as tertiles. Cardiovascular GLS was not associated with any of the cardiova scular phenotypes (p , 0.30 0.70). Nephropathic GLS, was not associated with albuminuria, while was significantly associated with decreased eGFR, with the score expressed both as natural value (p <0.01) and as tertiles (re spectively: 84.3ÃÂ±1.3, 81.7ÃÂ±1.5 and 78.9ÃÂ±1.5 ml/min/1.73 m2 p<0.02), even after age, sex, BMI, antihypertensive therapy and HbA1c adjustment.

Hemiagenesis of the thyroid (TH) is a rare congenital malformation presenting developmental failure of only one thyroid lobe, and an incidence of 1/2000 for general population. Majority of cases are sporadic, but the reported familial cases are suggestive for existence of genetic, heritable con tributors. Molecular background of the disorder remains unclear. The aim of the project was a screening for abnormalities in genes playing an important role in thyroid organogenesis. A microarray and exome sequencing approa ches were employed to identify novel genetic factors contributing to the disorder. Thirty nine TH patients participated in the study. The genetic ana lysis were conducted in all patients and encompasses sequencing of TPO, PAX8, FOXE1, NKX2 1 and TSHR genes as well as copy number investigation using Multiplex Ligation Dependent Probe Amplification (MLPA). The MLPA analysis did not reveal any unbalanced rearrangements. In selected cohort of patients a missense mutations in PAX8 and TBX1 sequences were found. Microarray examination resulted in identification of a several regions poten tially involved TH aetiology. Two genomic regions show recurrence in the cohort of sporadic, unrelated TH patients. This is a first report presenting comprehensive screening of genes contributing to severe forms of thyroid dysgenesis, in TH patients. Mutations in those genes confirm their impor tance for organ development but cannot explain the abnormal phenotype and bilobation disturbance for majority of TH sporadic cases.

Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) due to 21 hydroxylase deficiency is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by cortisol with/without aldosterone deficiency, and androgen excess. The severity of clinical mani festations depends on the degree of 21 hydroxylase impairment caused by mutations in the CYP21A2 gene. Its classic form has an overall incidence of 1 per 15000 live births. CYP21A2 is flanked by the TNXB gene, encoding the extracellular matrix protein tenascin X. Both, haploinsufficiency and complete loss of tenascin X have been associated with phenotypes similar to Ehlers Danlos syndrome (EDS). A significant portion of CAH patients pre sents deletion of mostly one CYP21A2 allele, and up to 13% of these might be a contiguous deletion extending into TNXB. We report two brothers (20 and 29 years old) with classic CAH and homo zygous deletion encompassing CYP21A2 and TNXB, who were evaluated for clinical evidence of EDS: both present skin hyperextensibility, joint hyperm obility and clinical history of multiple joint subluxations, without evidence of atrophic scars or other classic EDS features. The younger brother under went surgery for inguinal hernia and rectal prolapse during adolescence. Cardiac ultrasound examination revealed bicuspid aortic valve, mild aortic dilatation and mitral valve insufficiency in the older brother; cardiologic follow up was advised. The parents, heterozygous carriers of the contiguous deletion of CYP21A2 and TNXB, donÃ¢ÂÂt show clear features of EDS. To our knowledge, bicuspid aortic valve has not been observed in CAH with tenascin X related EDS yet.

Renal and urinary system malfor mations with their posterior complications such as urinary tract infections or proteinuria have been recognized to increase in patients with TS. In this retrospective study we report a detailed clinical history and analyzed renal and urinary system pathology in 32 girls with TS observed between 2000 2010. All 32 TS patients were evaluated by renal and collecting system utra sonography and if structural renal or urinary malformations were found, cystourethrography and centellography (DMSA or DTPA) was used. Patients mean age at renal and urological studies was 9,8 years (2 18 years). The cytogenetic findings in 32 patients with TS were: classic : 45,X in 18 pati ents (56,25%), mosaic and structural aberrations of X chromosome: in 14 patients (43,75%). The prevalence of renal and urinary system pathology was 43,75% ( 14 patients) . The most frequent findings were urinary system malformations 21,87% ( 7 patients) , associated with renal malformations 9,38% ( 3 patients), while 4 patients ( 12,5%) had renal malformations alo ne. Horseshoe kidney, malrotation or other position abnormalities, dupli cation of the collecting system, and different ureterovesicular obstruccion were found.

The aim of this study is to further define the genetic interplay between co gnate genes from metabolic and inflammatory pathways on the likelihood of developing T2DM in adulthood and to relate the association of certain ge netic profiles with defined biological and clinical endpoints. Method: Eight hundred carefully characterised T2DM cases were recruited. Anthropome tric and biochemical parameters, including serum high sensitivity C Reac tive protein (hsCRP) levels were determined, and genotyping of 43 cognate genes carried out. Neonatal cord blood samples were used as the control reference population in this study. Results: Ten polymorphisms in meta bolic/inflammatory pathways showed significant association with T2DM. Three loci showed significant association with lipid profile, body weight and hsCRP levels. hsCRP levels demonstrated a strong positive correlation with body mass index. Genetic score analysis showed that combining multiple genetic markers results in higher relative risks. The functional significance of these polymorphisms is being further evaluated using targeted siRNA mediated silencing in cultured monocytes. Conclusion: A panel of ten candi date genes has consistently demonstrated significant association with type 2 diabetes and metabolic syndrome in the Maltese population. These gene variants serve functional roles in inflammation and adipose tissue function. A recruited cohort of untreated newly diagnosed T2DM serves to identify and explore genotype phenotype association. The strong effect sizes of the se alleles could be used to develop personal genetic susceptibility profiles for T2DM leading to personalization of care and prevention of chronic com plications.",2014
21103,"The basis of conception of genetic sex determination was initially, at least in mammals, limited to a form of chromosomal currency. However, the pre sence of an entire Y chromosome is not essential for the development of the male phenotype and transfer of the SRY gene alone could be a sufficient condition. Critically, mutations in the SRY gene are linked with XY female sex reversal in mice and humans indicating that SRY is essential for male deve lopment. It appears that the only role of SRY is to upregulate the SRY related HMG box containing gene 9 (SOX9) bipotential gonads, which results in Ser toli cell differentiation and, ultimately, in testes differentiation. XX male sex reversal is rare and in most cases is the result of translocation of the SRY gene to the X chromosome during male meiosis. However, a recent report by Cox et al. [2011] described a family, two brothers and an uncle, with 46, XX male sex reversal who lacked the SRY gene and had a 600 kb duplication upstream of SOX9. We report on a case of a 38 infertile male (sent by the fertility unit) with azoospemia and hypergonadotrophic hypogonadism a 46 XX male sex reversal (without SRY). A 244K aCGH in the proband showed a novel and apparently, de novo duplication within SOX3 gene (at Xq27.1 chro mosomal region) in a complex genomic rearrangement.

Mu tations in COL4A3/COL4A4 (autosomal recessive/dominant), and COL4A5 (X linked) have been identified as underlying cause. Compared to ATS, auto somal dominant TBMN is characterized by hematuria, minimal proteinuria and preserved renal function. Dominant mutations have been identified in COL4A3 and COL4A4.A cohort of 167 patients and 49 relatives were genetically tested and clini cally evaluated. In 145 patients mutations were identified, 65 of them were novel. 54% resp. 88% of the ATS patients showed only one mutation in CO L4A3 or COL4A4. Three TBMN and eight ATS patients (COL4A3 or COL4A4) had hearing loss, but only two of the ATS patients carried two mutations. An ATS patient with one mutation in COL4A4 showed no hematuria, but pro teinuria, ESRD, and hearing loss. Two patients (COL4A5) showed isolated proteinuria. 26% of the ATS patients (COL4A5) had hearing loss and 43% of these presented the mutation at the 5Ã¢ÂÂ end of the gene. This study comprises one of the largest genotype phenotype correlation in European ATS and TBMN patients. A large number of novel mutations were detected. Many patients had only one heterozygous mutation in CO L4A3/COL4A4. This might be explained either by an autosomal dominant inheritance, the possibility of missed mutations, its function as a modifier additionally to so far unidentified causative mutations, or a combination of these possibilities. Interestingly, ATS/TBMN patients can also be affected by isolated proteinuria and TBMN patients rarely develop hearing loss.",2014

We designed a protocol to improve the referral and manage ment strategy for this particular patient group. Methods We report data on patients (n,167) referred to the department of clinical genetics to exclude rare genetic connective tissue disorders such as the Ehlers Danlos syndro me.

The low density lipoprotein receptor related protein 4 (LRP4) controls the ac tions of sclerostin which is a known inhibitor of the Wingless (Wnt)/Beta (ÃÂ²) catenin pathway involved in bone formation. Objective: To evaluate the effect of two non synonymous coding polymor phisms rs6485702 (A>G) and rs2306033 (C>T) in relation to Bone Mineral Density (BMD) and different low trauma fractures in Maltese postmenopau sal women. Methods: Research subjects were 1045 women subdivided in three BMD groups if without history of fragility fracture: normal, osteopenic or osteo porotic. Women with a fracture history were classified as cases. Genotyping was performed by polymerase chain reaction and restriction fragment length polymorphism. Associations with BMD and fracture were analysed using odds ratios (OR) determined by logistic regression and adjusted for age. Results: Homozygosity for the rs6485702 A allele was associated with a lower BMD at the lumbar spine, LS (OR,2.2 [95% confidence interval 1.1 4.4] p,0.03) relative to research subjects with a normal BMD. Heterozygotes for this allele had a lower BMD at the femoral neck, FN (OR,1.5 [1.1 2.2] p,0.02). The G C haplotype was strongly associated with LS BMD (p,0.004) and to a lower extent FN BMD (p,0.04). No association with fracture risk was seen (p>0.05). Conclusion: The LRP4 rs6485702 variant plays a role in BMD regulation in Maltese postmenopausal women. This polymorphism is located in the ÃÂ² propeller domain which is thought to interfere with the binding of sclerostin and hence will not affect Wnt signalling.",2014

To identify functional susceptibility variants, we investigated this locus using a targeted DNA sequencing approach. A 700kb region containing four genes (RIMS2, DCSTAMP , DPYS, and LRP12 ) was cap tured using the Haloplex target enrichment kit followed by DNA sequencing using the Illumina Hiseq2000 platform. A total of 244 samples were sequen ced (143 unrelated cases without SQSTM1 mutation, 40 controls, 48 familial cases and 13 controls). Variants passing quality control were subjected to multiple filters to include missense variant, those in the 5Ã¢ÂÂ or 3Ã¢ÂÂUTR or those predicted as functional by the ENCODE database. In DCSTAMP, we detected two novel variants (1 missense and 1 in 3Ã¢ÂÂUTR) that were not present in our controls or publicly available databases including 1000 genomes. The no vel missense mutation was detected in 3 cases and showed transmission in familial cases.

This identified compound heterozy gous nonsense (p. R208X) and missense (p. T221I) mutations in DYNC2LI1 segregating in the family. DYNC2LI1 is ubiquitously expressed and interacts with DYNC2H1 to form the dynein 2 complex important for retrograde in traflagellar transport. The hypothetical protein caused by the nonsense mutation lacks the coiled coil domain involved in protein interaction and dimerization. The mutation p.

Mutations in both DYNC2LI1 interacting partners DYNC2H1 and NEK1 are associated with Jeune/ATD/SRP III and SRPS II/ATD, respectively. The in termediate phenotype in the patient can be explained by its dimerization with DYNC2H1 and the suggested interaction between DYNC2LI1 and the basal body protein NEK1.

21114,"Background and objectives: Skeletal dysplasia are usually dominant disor ders due to heterozygous mutations in COL2A1 mutations. To report on four cases carrying two COL2A1 mutations. Methods: Bidirectional Sanger sequencing of the whole COL2A1 gene. Results: Four patients carrying two different mutations were identified in a series of 136 skeletal dysplasia. Patient 11 carried a p. Thr1439>Met paternal allele and a de novo c.1267 2A>G. This latter may explain that she presented with a more severe form of Kniest dysplasia than her affected father. The p. Ala145Val, predicted as benign, might not be contributive, as the p. Gly405Asp alone was shown as sociated with SEDC (Meredith SP , 2007). The association of p. Arg137His and p. Gly213Val seems to induce a different phenotype than previously obser ved in a patient carrying a heterozygous p. Gly213Val (Kannu M, 2011).Conclusion: We report here the first cases of COL2A1 skeletal dysplasia with either compound heterozygous (recessive) or complex alleles. Recessive forms of type 2 Stickler syndrome were previously associated with COL11A1 (Richards AJ, 2013). ParentsÃ¢ÂÂ samples from families 41, 47, and 49 are under evaluation to phase the mutations and define whether they are de novo. a Barat Houari M, unpublished data, b Unger S 2001, c Meredith SP 2007, d Kannu P 2011, e Score Family IDPhenotype (MIM number) Mutation 1 Score(e) Mutation 2Score (e) 11 Kniest dysplasia (156550)c.1267 2A>G (a)68%p.

21115,"Congenital myopathy disorders (CMDs) are heterogeneous inherited di seases of muscle characterized by a range of distinctive histologic abnor malities. We have studied a consanguineous family with a non progressive congenital myopathy. In order to pursue a molecular diagnosis in this family, we performed genotyping on four patients, their parents and a healthy sib ling using the Affymetrix GeneChip Human SNP5 array. We determined the genotype calls by using Affymetrix GeneChip Genotyping Analysis Software (GTYPE) and KinSNP software. Based on the consanguinity in the family, we hypothesized homozygosity by descent of a recessive mutation as the likely cause of the disorder. Therefore, we searched for homozygous regions con sistent with linkage. Three homozygous blocks (on chromosomes 6, 10 and 14) shared by the three affected individuals, heterozygous in the parents, and not homozygous in the unaffected sib were identified. Exome sequen cing revealed a highly suggestive mutation in a gene not previously repor ted to be associated with myopathy in humans. The variation segregated as expected in the family, it did not appear in dbSNP , evs or the 1000 genome project, nor was it found in 134 Bedouin control individuals.",2014
21116,"Introduction Next generation sequencing (NGS) offers a valuable tool for the diagnostics of connective tissue disorders (CTDs), in view of the large size of most of the genes involved and the complex spectrum of, often over lapping, phenotypes, which makes differential diagnosis difficult. Recently, we designed a platform for the targeted analysis of CTDs, including Mar fan syndrome, Ehlers Danlos syndrome, Osteogenesis imperfecta, Stickler syndrome and related disorders. In total, 42 genes were included. Based on the associated phenotypes, six gene panels were defined. Material and methods A solution based target enrichment kit was designed to capture all exons and flanking splice sites of 42 genes. Data were analysed using an in house pipeline (based on freely available software) and Cartagenia. In total, 309 gene panels were analysed on 290 patients referred to our Dia gnostics. The aortic/arterial aneurysms/dissections and the Ehlers Danlos syndromes were the most requested gene panels (90%). Results (Likely) pathogenic mutations were identified in 14.5% of the patients. In most of these patients DNA findings confirmed the clinical diagnosis or were in line with the proposed differential diagnosis. Altogether, NGS strongly facilitated pinpointing the correct diagnosis. Importantly, in a few cases NGS led to a different diagnosis, which had not been considered based on clinical pre sentation. Conclusions The CTDs NGS platform offers advantages in terms of time efficiency, in view of the complex spectrum of phenotypes and the difficult differential diagnosis. This methodology helps preventing misdia gnosis, especially in young patient with incomplete phenotypic expression. The clinical phenotype of certain CTDs will possibly expand in the future.",2014

Sagittal craniosynostosis (sNSC) is a highly prevalent craniofacial malforma tion, with a widely unclear etiopathogenesis. A possible involvement of the BBS9 gene, encoding a protein located in the transition zone of the primary cilium, has been proposed as a result of the first GWAS carried out in 2012. Through microarray genome wide expression profiling we have shown an altered expression of cilium associated genes, including BBS9, in calvarial tissues and cells of sNSC patients. We aimed at investigating the role of BBS9 in the aberrant osteogenic phenotype of calvarial cells isolated from sNSC patients, through gene expression analysis, immunofluorescence, gene si lencing, and differentiation assays. BBS9 expression was significantly upre gulated in cells isolated from fused sutures (syn cells) compared to cells isolated from matched patent sutures (control cells), and increased upon 5 days of osteogenic induction. Confocal microscopy showed that: syn cells produced less primary cilia compared to control cells; BBS9 expression was spread throughout the cytoplasm in syn cells, while appeared organized in polarized structures surrounding the cilium basal body in control cells. Upon BBS9 silencing in syn cells, the expression of osteo specific transcrip tion factors (RUNX2 and OSX), and of SMO (key molecule of the hedgehog pathway), were significantly down regulated. The osteogenic potential of BBS9 silenced syn cells decreased and reverted to the physiological beha viour observed in controls. Our results suggest a functional involvement of BBS9 and primary cilium signalling, in the aberrant osteogenic signalling occurring at the site of premature suture closure in sNSC, proving a possib le novel role of this molecular machinery in osteogenesis and craniofacial malformations.",2014

The aim of this study is to describe the inventory of structural chromosomal ab errations identified through cytogenetic and molecular cytogenetic testing (as a part of the diagnostic algorithm) in a sample of complex CRS patients. The possible role of the genes involved in the genomic rearrangements in CRS etiopathogenesis have been investigated in vitro, using gene expression analysis, immunofluorescence and gene silencing assays, on calvarial stem cells isolated from CRS patients. In our center we have enrolled 253 patients affected by CRS, including 13 cases with complex phenotypes that did not resemble any clear known syn drome. In 9 out of 13 cases, standard cytogenetics and array CGH allowed evidencing a chromosomal structural mutation, encompassing. multiple alternative genomic loci (2p, 9q, 2q, 22q, 8q, 9, 10, 5, 17, and 7p, among others). Genes involved in craniofacial development have been mapped to those loci enabling a biological interpretation of the abnormalities.

Cuore, Rome, Italy, 3Latium Musculoskeletal Tissue Bank, Rome, Italy. The etiopathogenesis of midline nonsyndromic craniosynostosis remains still largely unclear. We attempted to clarify this issue using microarray comparative gene expression profiling. Among the differentially expressed genes, we focused particularly on the hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase (HPGD) gene, which encodes the prostaglandin E 2 (PGE2) catabolizing en zyme, whose pathway is known to be involved in osteogenic differentiation. Mutations in this gene result in primary autosomal recessive hypertrophic osteoarthropathy and craniosteoarthropathy. Total RNA and calvarial cells were isolated from calvarial specimens of both sutures and synostoses of NSC patients, collected during surgery. RNA was used for exon level mi croarray analysis; gene expression and alternative splicing events were con firmed using real time PCR and RT PCR. For functional validation, calvarial cells isolated in primary culture were treated with scalar concentrations of PGE2; after 10 days of treatment cells were alternatively lysed to extract RNA or stained with Alizarin Red to analyze osteogenic differentiation. Gene expression profiling allowed the identification of 114 significantly modula ted genes and 150 alternatively spliced genes, including HPGD. Exon level analysis of HPGD revealed that the gene encoding the active isoform of the enzyme was significantly downregulated in synostosis derived tissues. Upon PGE2 treatment, cells isolated from synostoses displayed a higher amount of osteogenic differentiation compared to patent suture derived cells, as a result of the reduced HPGD levels. The results of this study may provide the original description of an impairment in the PGE2 signaling pathway in the pathogenesis of premature suture fusion in NSC patients. Translational im plications may further derive from these data.",2014
21120,"Introduction According to literature, the genetic cause of craniosynosto sis can be identified in approximately 24% of the patients. Often, mutations are found in FGFR2, FGFR3 and TWIST1. But mutations are also identified in many other genes (like IL11RA , TCF12 and ERF ). Those genes can be sequenced all in parallel by Next Generation Sequencing (NGS), leading to more complete diagnostics. Methods Syndromic craniosynostosis was defi ned as multisuture or unicoronal synostosis, familial craniosynostosis, or as craniosynostosis in combination with other congenital malformations and/or mental retardation. According to protocol, these syndromic craniosyn ostosis patients were tested by single gene testing for mutations in FGFR2, FGFR3, and TWIST1. If these genes tested negative, other genes were analy zed if applicable. In addition, a subgroup of 8 families (15 patients, 11 cli nically unaffected relatives) and 8 isolated patients were sequenced by NGS and checked for mutations in known craniosynostosis genes. Results Of our patient cohort, 705 patients were tested by single gene testing. Mutations were found in 280 patients. By NGS, mutations were identified in TCF12 (1 patient, 1 unaffected carrier, 1 relative), IL11RA (1 patient, 2 relatives), ZIC1 (three patients, 1 relative) and in IDS (1 isolated patient). Conclusion By single gene testing, mutations were identified in only 15% of the syndromic craniosynostosis patients. Possibly, because the group of tested patients was defined differently, but also because only a subset of genes was tested. By NGS of a small cohort, mutations were identified in additional genes in 6/23 patients, illustrating the power of parallel sequencing.",2014
21121,"Brooke Spiegler syndrome (BSS; OMIM 605041) is an autosomal dominant condition characterized by skin appendageal neoplasms including cylin dromas, trichoepitheliomas, and/or spiradenomas. In 2000, the gene locus for BSS was mapped to 16q12 13, and, in the same year, variants of the cy lindromatosis gene (CYLD) were identified in BSS, familial cylindromato sis (FC; OMIM 132700) and/or multiple familial trichoepithelioma type 1 (MFT1; OMIM 601606). The gene codes for an enzyme with deubiquitinase activity. To date, a total of 81 different disease causing mutations have been published for the CYLD gene. A summary of recurrent mutations identified in Hungarian patients and a review of published mutations is presented in this update. Comparison of clinical features in affected families with the same mutation strongly confirms that identical mutations of the CYLD gene can give rise to different phenotypes, making genotype phenotype corre lations difficult. Variable expression of the phenotype associated with the same CYLD mutation may reflect the influence of other genetic and/or envi ronmental factors. Most mutations are frameshift (43%), nonsense (24%), splicing (16%) and missense ones (12%), but there are some reported rare variants as well (5%). The vast majority of the mutations (99%) are located between exon 9 20, which encodes the 3rd Cap Glycin and the ubiquitin specific protease domains of the CYLD protein, suggesting that these do mains are important for CYLD deubiquitinating activity.

Medical Genetics, Torino, Italy, 6Department of Pediatrics and Clinical Genetics, Academic Medical Center, University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam, Netherlands. We report on a girl with widespread, rapidly progressive ectopic calcificati ons detected shortly after birth. Calcifications became present around most joints, involving tendons and ligaments, but no internal organs or skin, and eventually caused almost complete immobility of the child at 2 years. Labo ratory evaluation failed to identify autoimmune disorders as well as calcium metabolism or other biochemical abnormalities; molecular studies did not identify any mutation in disease genes known to be involved in ectopic cal cifications. Further analysis identified a de novo insertional translocation (IT). Array CGH analysis showed a 2p13.3 duplication which was validated by qRT PCR. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) confirmed the rear rangement, a der(X)ins(X;2)(q26.1;p13.3). The two breakpoints were cha racterized at nucleotide level by inverse PCR. The duplication on chromoso me 2 encompassed nine coding genes, seven completely duplicated and two (ANTXR1 and MXD1) partially duplicated. ANTXR1 is interrupted in IVS10; the MXD1 coding sequence is maintained, but its 3Ã¢ÂÂ UTR is almost comple tely lost. The chromosome 2p13.3 duplication is inserted into a gene desert on chromosome Xp26.1, between ARHGAP36 and IGSF1 genes. We suggest the phenotype in our patient is due to a likely gain of function mechanism. We hypothesize that the de novo insertional translocation causes a fusion transcript or an altered regulation of a gene by position effect. Further stu dies are in progress to identify the pathogenic mechanism triggering this unique phenotype. ABSTRACTS POSTERS ESHG 2014 | MILAN, ITALY | WWW. ESHG. ORG 101Back to inde x",2014
21123,"Recently mutations in FKBP14 have been identified in patients with a no vel variant of Ehlers Danlos syndrome (EDS) characterized by progressive kyphoscoliosis, myopathy and hearing loss (MIM #614557). This disorder shares many clinical features with the kyphoscoliotic type of EDS (EDS VIA; MIM 225400) such as congenital hypotonia, progressive kyphoscoliosis, hy perelastic skin and hypermobility of joints. However, there are also some distinctive features like myopathy and hearing loss. While an increased ratio of urinary lysyl pyridinoline (LP) to hydroxylysyl pyridinoline (HP) is dia gnostic for EDS VIA, measurement is normal in patients with EDS caused by mutations in FKBP14 . Here we report on an 8 year old girl born to first cousin parents, who pre sented with severe congenital hypotonia, psychomotor retardation, severe muscle weakness, progressive scoliosis, severe joint hypermobility of fin gers, wrists and toes, soft skin, easy bruising, bilateral clubfoot, prominent heel and pes planus, normal hearing, nasal speech and dysarthria. Because of a suggestive clinical history by absence of hearing impairment our in itial clinical diagnosis was EDS VIA, but normal LP/HP in urine ruled out this condition. Therefore we sequenced FKBP14 and detected a novel ho mozygous c.143T>A substitution in exon 1 causing a p. Met48Lys mutation. Hearing loss, was consistently reported in the initial cohort of patients with this novel form of EDS, in whom nonsense mutations were found. It is com pelling to hypothesize that absence of hearing impairment in our patient might reflect a partial loss of function of FKBP14 caused by the identified p. Met48Lys missense mutation, thus suggesting a possible genotype phe notype correlation.",2014
21124,"Proteoglycans are important components of cell plasma membranes and ex tracellular matrices. They are composed of glycosaminoglycan (GAG) chains attached to a core protein through a tetrasaccharide linker region. The addi tion of the third residue in this linker is catalysed by galactosyltransferase II (ÃÂ²3GalT6), encoded by B3GALT6.We recently identified bi allelic mutations in B3GALT6 in several individu als from independent families with a severe autosomal recessive pleiotropic connective tissue disorder characterized by skin fragility, delayed wound healing, joint hypermobility and contractures, muscle hypotonia, intellec tual disability and a spondyloepimetaphyseal dysplasia with bone fragility and severe kyphoscoliosis. To characterize the function of ÃÂ²3GalT6 we em ployed zebrafish as an in vivo model. Whole mount in situ hybridization of zebrafish embryos showed high b3galt6 expression levels in brain, retina, pharyngeal arches and notochord epithelium, corresponding to tissues that are affected in the human patients. A morpholino based approach was used to characterize the developmental effects of b3galt6 knockdown in zebrafish embryos. Complete knockdown of b3galt6 is lethal, but partial knockdown results in an abnormal pharyngeal cartilage phenotype and a notably redu ced head and eye size. These morphological changes were accompanied by a significant reduction in the total amount of sulfated GAG chains. In conclusion, our results emphasize a crucial role for ÃÂ²3GalT6 in GAG syn thesis and development. Ongoing and future experiments aim to extensively analyze the changes in GAG composition as well as to further characterize the way in which these changes impact embryonic development of e.g. carti lage and heart using different fluorescent transgenic reporter lines.",2014
21125,"Different forms of Ehlers Danlos Syndrome (EDS) exist, with specific pheno types and genes associated. Vascular EDS, caused by mutations in COL3A1 , is characterized by a fragile vasculature with a high risk of catastrophic vas cular events at young age. Classic EDS, characterized by fragile, hyperexten sible skin and joint laxity, is caused by mutations in COL5A1 and COL5A2 . To date, vessel rupture in four unrelated classic EDS patients with a confirmed COL5A1 mutation was reported. In the current report, we describe a familial form of clinically vascular EDS, diagnosed in a mother and her two sons, who all three died at an early age from arterial ruptures. Diagnostic Sanger sequencing failed to detect a CO L3A1 mutation in the eldest son, our index case. Next, our probands DNA was analyzed using a next generation sequencing approach targeting ap proximately 550 genes (possibly) linked to vascular disease (VASCULOME project). This revealed a heterozygous pathogenic mutation in COL5A1 , re sulting in an essential glycine substitution in the triple helix domain, ne arby the C terminus of the protein (c.4610G>T; p. Gly1537Val). This novel mutation was present in DNA isolated from autopsy material of his brother. No autopsy material was available from the mother, but the mutation was excluded in her parents, siblings and in the father of her sons, suggesting that the COL5A1 mutation occurred in the motherÃ¢ÂÂs genome de novo. This is the first describtion of familial vascular EDS with a pathogenic mu tation in COL5A1 . We conclude that this mutation can give a similar vascular EDS phenotype as a COL3A1 mutation.",2014
21126,"Dermatan 4 O sulfotransferase 1 (D4ST1) deficient Ehlers Danlos syndro me (DDEDS), caused by recessive loss of function mutations in CHST14, is a recently delineated form of EDS [DÃÂ¼ndar et al., 2009; Malfait et al., 2010; Miyake et al., 2010; Kosho et al., 2011], characterized by a unique set of cli nical features consisting of progressive multisystem fragility related mani festations (skin hyperextensibilty and fragility, progressive spinal and foot deformities, large subcutaneous hematoma) and various malformations (facial features, congenital multiple contractures). Multisystem connective tissue fragility is caused by impaired assembly of collagen fibrils through loss of dermatan sulfate (DS) replaced by chondroitin sulfate in the decorin glycosaminoglycan sidechains. Complete loss of DS in patientsÃ¢ÂÂ urine sug gests systemic loss of DS to be the basis of the disorder. Because the pa tients suffer from progressive multisystem fragility related complications, appropriate disease modeling is indispensable in view of developing etiolo gy based therapy. In this study, we report phenotypic features of knockout (Chst14 / ) mice. Frozen sperm from Chst14+/ male mice were obtained from the Mutant Mouse Regional Resource Center, Chst14+/ mice were re produced, and Chst14 / mice were generated. Complete loss of DS in urine from Chst14 / mice was demonstrated, suggesting these mice to reflect gly cobiological abnormalities in DDEDS. Chst14 / mice lacked congenital mul tiple contractures, but showed perinatal lethality, reduced postnatal weight gain, mild facial asymmetricity, thoracic kyphosis, and reduced grip power and skin tenacity, compared with Chst14+/+ or Chst14+/ mice. These fea tures could be therapeutic targets for etiology based therapy such as AAV vector mediated gene therapy. ABSTRACTS POSTERS ESHG 2014 | MILAN, ITALY | WWW. ESHG. ORG 102Back to inde x",2014
21127,"Metacarpal 4 5 fusion (MF4; MIM%309630) is a rare congenital malforma tion of the hand characterized by the partial or complete fusion of the 4th and 5th metacarpals. The anomaly occurs either as an isolated trait or part of a genetic syndrome. Recently, using whole exome sequencing (WES), we have uncovered the genetic cause of isolated MF4. WES was performed on samples form a single trio of Polish ethnicity, i.e. sporadic male proband pre senting with isolated MF4 and his unaffected parents. The study revealed a nonsense mutation (c. C535T; p. R179X) in exon 3 of the FGF16 gene, which maps to chromosome Xq21.1. The result was than confirmed by Sanger se quencing. The link between FGF16 gene mutations and MF4 was further supported by the identification of two other truncating FGF16 mutation in two unrelated male probands. Sanger sequencing showed that one index case carried a nonsense mutation (c. C470A; p. S157X), whereas the other harbored a truncating frameshift variant (c.474_477del; p. E158DfsX25). Two out of three mothers of the probands were available for testing. Upon assessment, they were clinically and radiologically unaffected and both car ried FGF16 heterozygous mutations. All of the FGF16 disease causing va riants identified by us were located in the last exon (exon 3) of the gene, therefore they are unlikely to result in a nonsense mediated decay. Our study shows that truncating mutations of FGF16 are associated with X linked re cessive metacarpal 4 5 fusion and provides evidence for the involvement of FGF16 in the fine patterning of the human skeleton of the hand.",2014
21128,"Giant cell tumor of bone (GCT) is an aggressive bone tumor caused by the uncontrolled proliferation of the spindle like stromal cells which promote osteoclast like giant cells formation responsible for the osteolitic lesions. A recent study showed that GCT is due to recurrent somatic mutations in H3F3A gene in the stromal cells. We analysed a cohort of giant cell tumor of bone for the presence of H3F3A mutations identifying somatic mutations in 38 out of 44 cases (86%). In contrast, the analysis of patients with PagetÃ¢ÂÂs disease of bone (PDB) associated with giant cell tumor did not show any mutation in H3F3A gene, at both somatic and germline level, suggesting a different genetic background. We recently reported an extended Italian fa mily in which 4 out of 14 PDB affected members developed multiple GCTs at pagetic skeletal sites. Clinically, all affected members had polyostotic PDB, but subjects developing giant cell tumors showed an increased disease se verity with a reduced clinical response to bisphosphonate treatment and an increased prevalence of bone pain, deformities, and fractures. Whole exome sequencing, in this family identifies a missense mutation in a novel uncharacterized gene. Additional genetic analysis in 7 independent affected patients with the same clinical phenotype, discloses the same mutation in all patients, strongly suggesting that this clinical phenotype is due to a founder effect. Therefore, we conclude that the GCT phenotypes associated or not with PDB are due to mutations in different genes, suggesting that different molecular signatures are responsible for these two phenotypes.",2014
21129,"Nonsyndromic cleft lip with or without cleft palate (nsCL/P) is one of the most common congenital malformations worldwide and considered to be of multifactorial etiology. NsCL/P shows considerable phenotypic variability and can be subdivided into nonsyndromic cleft lip only (nsCLO) and nonsyn dromic cleft lip and palate (nsCLP). Genome wide and replication studies have recently led to the identification of 15 nsCL/P susceptibility loci. However, a number of additional genetic risk factors still await elucidation. Here we used data from a recent genome wide meta analysis (Ludwig et al. 2012, Nature Genetics) and combined these with results from an independent European trio cohort (n,793). In tegration of subgroup information on nsCLO or nsCLP revealed rs1258763 on chr. 15q13 as a novel genome wide significant locus associated with ns CLP (P,1.04ÃÂ10 08). The associated region maps in intergenically, between the Gremlin 1 (GREM1) and Formin 1 (FMN1) genes. GREM1 is a known antagonist in bone morphogenetic protein pathways which are relevant to craniofacial genesis. Sequencing the entire GREM1 coding region in 196 pa tients and 196 controls did not reveal a causal variant, however, a significant overrepresentation of rare variants within patients was observed (P,0.02). Analyses of murine Grem1 expression during embryonic craniofacial deve lopment might suggest a functional role of Grem1 in lip and secondary pala te formation. Notably, the top variant rs1258763 has previously been shown to influence variation in facial morphology (Boehringer et al. 2011, EJHG, Liu et al. 2012, PloS Genetics).Our results demonstrate that increasing sample sizes and precise phenoty pic information might help identifying further risk loci for genetically com plex traits.",2014

Methods Direct genomic PCR using primers in the NEMO gene was used ABSTRACTS POSTERS ESHG 2014 | MILAN, ITALY | WWW. ESHG. ORG 103Back to inde x to test for the classical exon 4 10 deletion. Sequence analysis of NEMO was performed using standard Sanger sequencing. X inactivation was measured using a methylation sensitive restriction enzyme. An Affymetrix Cytoscan HD array was used to detect copy number variations (CNVs) according to the manufacturerÃ¢ÂÂs protocol. Results The classical NEMO exon 4 10 deletion was detected in one patient and her mother. In another patient, a 130 kb interstitial gain in chromosome 17q25.3 was identified, containing five genes (CD7, SECTM1, GPR14, TEX19 and OGFOD3). There was no skewed X inactivation. The fourth patient was not molecularly investigated. Discussion We show four female patients with a clinical IP phenotype and different genetic defects. NEMO deletions impair NF kB activation, causing IP cells to be highly sensitive to apoptosis. Interestingly, a novel 130 kb gain of chromosome 17q25.3 was identified in another patient, including SECTM1. SECTM1 is shown to induce IFN ÃÂ³ production in vitro; IFN ÃÂ³ stimu lates apoptosis. We hypothesize that a dosis effect, caused by the SECTM1 duplication, induces cell death and thereby causes IP . This finding suggests heterogeneity of IP and supports the role of apoptotic pathway CNVs in this disorder.",2014

21132,"Inguinal hernia repair is one of the most frequently performed gastrointesti nal surgical procedures. Over 700,000 groin hernias are repaired annually both in the United States and Europe. Males are seven times more likely than females to develop a hernia and have a 27% lifetime risk of developing an inguinal hernia. Risk factors that have been associated with developing in guinal hernias include male gender, aging, pulmonary disease with chronic cough, and other conditions that cause constant increase of intra abdominal pressure. Connective tissue disorders, such as Ehlers Danlos and Marfan syndromes, and systemic collagen subtype imbalances have also been as sociated with increased risk of hernia. Furthermore, several studies have demonstrated that a positive family history is an important risk factor for the development of primary inguinal hernia. The aim of this study was to investigate a multiplex Estonian family with inguinal hernia in four generations. Whole exome sequencing was carried out in three affected family members and subsequent mutation screening using Sanger sequencing was performed in 8 family members (five affected and three unaffected). A heterozygous missense mutation p. Lys29627Thr was identified in the highly conserved A band of the titin gene (TTN ). The mutation co segregated with the disease in the family, and was not present in 875 ethnically matched control subjects.",2014
21133,"A girl born to healthy non consanguineous parents and her three year younger brother showed at birth moderate to severe respiratory insuffici ency which required long term tracheostomy in the boy. Both neonates were large with plump facial features, narrow thoracic cage with radiogra phic bell shaped configuration. Diastasis of the abdominal wall musculature and signs of distal arthrogryposis were mild in the girl and pronounced in the boy. Neuromotor development was delayed with independent walking achieved at 18 months and at 5ÃÂ½ years respectively. The mild intellectual disability in the boy, who has persisting contractures at the wrists and an kles, may be correlated with bouts of therapy resistant hypoxia during the NICU admission of six months duration. At night he still needs mechanical support with airflow. The clinical and radiographic pattern in both sibs was compatible with pa ternal UPD 14. However, an imprinting defect was ruled out using microsa tellite marker analysis. Recently, the ladyÃ¢ÂÂs complaints about long lasting re spiratory infections and physical tiredness prompted reexamination of this family. SNP array analysis using an Illumina Cyto SNP 12v2.1 chip detected a microdeletion on chromosome band 14q32.2 in both sibs. The deletion with a minimal size of 64 kb encompasses the lncRNA genes MEG3 and MEG8 and several miRNAs. Each of these genes is subject to maternal imprinting. The mother is mosaic for the same microdeletion. Molecular analysis regarding exact size, gene content and degree of methylation is ongoing and bound to contribute to more insights into the disease mechanisms involved in this imprinted region.",2014
21134,"Limb reduction defects (LRDs) are usually unilateral and affect 8 newborns per 10000 livebirths. Several authors hypothesized that vascular accidents may account for a substantial proportion of LRDs, however the basis of such events in the fetus remains unknown. Over the past two decades, a number of genetic thrombophilia risk factors (TRFs) have been identified and asso ciated with the increased risk of peri/postnatal occlusive disease and with a higher rate of pregnancy loss. Mutations c. G1691A(p. R506Q) in F5 and c.*97G>A in F2 genes represent one of the most commonly tested genetic TRFs. In this study, a cohort of 45 proband mother pairs, in which the child manifested unilateral LRDs, was recruited for the analyses. The patients were clinically evaluated and blood of the probands and their mothers was subjected to both F5 and F2 testing. We found either F2 or F5 heterozygous variant (or both) in 6 mothers (13.3%) and in 4 probands (8.9%). At least one individual carried a single (or both) mutation(s) in seven proband mo ther pairs (15.6%). Within this group one proband and one mother carried both mutations. F5 and F2 are identified in a control population with the frequency of about 1 2%. Based on our findings, we hypothesize that there is an excess of genetic TRFs in probands affected by unilateral LRDs and in their healthy mothers in comparison with control population. This may con tribute to the higher risk of antenatal vascular accidents and consequently to LRDs. Further studies based on bigger samples are needed to support our findings.",2014

21136,"Marfan syndrome is an autosomal dominant disorder of connective tissue with skeletal, ocular and cardiovascular system involvement. Sequencing of the fibrillin 1 (FBN1) gene has a 70 90% mutation detection rate in patients with Marfan syndrome. The goal of this study was to establish a diagnostic workflow for rapid and reliable mutation detection in the FBN1 gene. Exons and flanking regions of the FBN1 gene were amplified in 65 ampli cons using published and newly designed primers. Our workflow was based on the followings: 1) exons containing homopolymer regions (n,16) were tested by Sanger sequencing method because of the well known high error rate of pyrosequencing based next generation sequencing (NGS) in such re gions, 2) all other amplicons were sequenced using NGS (Roche GS Junior), where coverage criterion was above 40x. Pathogenic mutations detected by NGS method were confirmed by Sanger sequencing. Eleven families (15 patients) were tested with a mutation detection rate of 8/11 unrelated patients. 7 missense (6 of them affecting cystein residues) were found and one base pair deletion causing frameshift. 5 novel mutations were detected. By combining NGS and Sanger sequencing methods reliable diagnostic workflow could be established for Marfan syndrome.",2014
21137,"Melorheostosis is an uncommon, relatively benign, sclerosing bone disea se, characterized by long bones hyperostosis, resembling flowing of cand le wax. Skin and subcutaneous tissue can be involved. The disease may be asyntomatic (incidental X ray diagnosis, finding of the typical hyperostosis pattern) or cause pain, joint stiffness or deformity. Melorheostosis is spora dic and pathogenesis is largely unknown. Occasionally in the same family we observe individuals with melorheostosis and osteopoikilosis, disease characterized by multiple round foci of increased bone density. LEMD3 gene mutations have been revealed in osteopoikilosis and Buschke Ollendorff Syndrome (BOS), an association of skin lesions, as connective tissue nae vi, and osteopoikilosis or melorheostosis. Sporadically LEMD3 mutations have been identified in Melorheostosis. Recently it has been suggested that LEMD3 mutation somatic mosaicism cause Melorheostosis. Most reports describe single cases or are focused on orthopedic management; only few and small series have been reported in medical literature and molecular analysis data are available only for few patients. We present clinical and radiological information of 23 patients with Melorheostosis (14), BOS (2), osteopoikilosis (3) or with findings of similar disease (4). Among patients with isolated melorheostosis until now analyzed, none has LEMD3 germ line mutation. Instead, we identified mutations in all BOS patients and in 2/3 patients with osteopoikilosis. No mutation has been identified in cases with unclear diagnosis. These results confirm literature data, indicating that LEMD3 germline mutations are not a major cause of isolated melorheosto sis and are mainly associated to BOS or osteopoikilosis. Further studies are needed to understand molecular bases of Melorheostosis.",2014
21138,"Marfan syndrome (MFS), an autosomal dominant connective tissue disorder, is mainly due to fibrillin 1 (FBN1) gene mutations. MFS primarily affects the skeletal, ocular and cardiovascular systems. The vast majority of MFS cases are caused by point mutations in FBN1 with only 1 2% due to large deleti ons. Transposons are abundant in the human genome and retrotransposons have been reported to cause disease by inserting into genes. We describe the detection of an intragenic FBN1 deletion by chromosomal microarray analy sis (CMA) in a child with mildly dilated aortic sinus. Breakpoint sequencing showed that the deletion was due to a SVA retrotransposition. The child was first seen at 4 years of age. Echocardiogram showed a mildly dilated aortic sinus. He had a history of muscular VSD (closed spontaneously) and trivial mitral regurgitation. Phenotypes include frontal bossing, anteverted ears, pink striae and joint hyperlaxity. He also had a learning disability and at tention deficit. CMA with an Agilent 1M array detected a 36 kb deletion at 15q21.1 which is predicted to result in a deletion of exons 7 9 of the FBN1 gene. Long range PCR confirmed the deletion of exons 7 9 of the FBN1 gene and the insertion of a MAST2 SVA transposon. CMA confirmed a diagnosis of MFS in a child who had a few MFS clinical symptoms but who did not fulfil the Ghent criteria. This diagnosis will enable appropriate surveillance, pati ent management and genetic counselling. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of MFS caused by retrotransposition.",2014
21139,"Purpose: Genetic skin diseases (genodermatoses) represent a broad and heterogeneous spectrum of mainly rare conditions. Overlapping pheno types additionally often hamper clear clinical diagnosis and straightforward genetic testing. As a precise genetic diagnosis is crucial for counseling of patients regarding the course of the disease, prognosis, recurrence risk, and therapeutic approach, we have developed a diagnostic panel based on Next Generation Sequencing (NGS).Method: 241 genes were selected from the OMIM database and literature. After customized target enrichment, NGS was performed using the HiSeq 2500 platform (Illumina), followed by bioinformatics analysis. Variants with minor allele frequencies < 5 % were selected for further investigati on. Validation of relevant variants was performed using Sanger sequencing. Results: We subdivided the genodermatoses panel according to the most relevant phenotypes, e.g., ichthyosis, epidermolysis bullosa, ectodermal dys plasia, connective tissue defects, dyskeratosis congenita, albinism, and skin disorders associated with malignancy. In a pilot study we have identified clear pathogenic mutations within the genes ALOX12B , TP63, PLOD1, and ABCC6. The preliminary data indicate high detection rates: in 22 % of the cases we identified clearly pathogenic mutations, in 33 % likely pathogenic variants were detected, and 44 % remained unsolved. Conclusion: We have developed a comprehensive panel based diagnostic NGS tool for diagnosing genetic skin diseases. This highly reliable and very cost efficient diagnostic panel enables us to molecularly diagnose patients with clinically heteroge neous and also very rare skin diseases. Furthermore, it contributes to a bet ter understanding of genotype phenotype correlations. ABSTRACTS POSTERS ESHG 2014 | MILAN, ITALY | WWW. ESHG. ORG 105Back to inde x",2014
21140,"Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) and Legius syndrome (LS) are autosomal dominant disorders caused by germline mutations in NF1 or SPRED1 gene respectively. The NF1 phenotype partially overlaps the most benign of LS that can be just molecularly distinguished. Appearance of typical NF1 fea tures, like neurofibromas and Lisch nodules, is age related thus pigmentary manifestations (cafÃÂ¨ au lait macules and/or freckling) can be the only clini cal sign of NF1 in early childhood, making difficult to distinguish NF1 and LS. The occurrence of serious NF1 complications (i.e. MPNST , brain gliomas) emphasizes the usefulness of an early differential diagnosis. To address a proper diagnosis, we applied a specific clinical workflow and a compre hensive genetic test in a cohort of 149 children. Pigmentary manifestations were considered as the main sign combined with presence of typical NF1 features and/or affected first degree, and with the age at medical examina tion. 128 (85.9%) had a clinical diagnosis of NF1. For 17 (11.4%) NF1 vs LS was undistinguishable and 4 (2.7%) had a diagnosis of familiar occurrence of pigmentary manifestations. A causative mutation was found in 122/128 patients (95.3%) confirming NF1 clinical diagnosis. 11 patients with am biguous diagnosis carried NF1 mutations (64.7%), 2 carried SPRED1 mu tations (11.8%). Among those thought to be LS, 3 had mutation in SPRED1 (75.0%), one in NF1 (25.0%). Children with just NF1 pigmentary manife stations would be clinically followed for long time waiting the age related appearance of most typical features. Thus an early molecular diagnosis might be very useful, considering that the milder LS phenotype require a less intensive follow up.",2014

Diagnosis of Neurofibromatosis I (NF1) is typically based on clinical criteria, with genetic testing being performed only in a fraction of cases. We review ed the records of NF1 patients referred to our clinic to explore what factors may have conditioned the choice to undertake genetic testing. Among 100 consultants attending for a family/personal history of NF1 in the period December 2002 to December 2013, clinical data were available for 94 patients: 68 patients satisfied the criteria for the clinical diagnosis of NF1 and in 44 of these (65%) NF1 gene analysis were performed, leading to mutation detection in 26 cases (60%). Tested patients differed from unte sted patients by median age at diagnosis (12 versus 23 years) and number of criteria satisfied (Ã¢ÂÂ¥3 in 75% of tested and 30% of untested), while the rate of familial cases did not differ between the two groups (27% among tested, 26% of non tested). Moreover, the rate of patients tested has increased in the years, from the 33 50% in the period 2003 2005 to the 50 100% of pati ents tested in the period 2006 2013. In conclusion, genetic testing was more likely to be undertaken in patients diagnosed in childhood and in those with a more severe phenotype, especially in recent years. Indeed NF1 analysis is demanding but has been improved across the years, which makes genetic test now more accessible.",2014

OCA results in reduced or absence of pigmentation in the hair, skin, and eyes. Type 1 OCA (OCA1) results from tyrosinase (TYR) gene mutation and is a se vere disease type. This study investigated TYR mutations in a Chinese cohort with OCA1. Methods: This study included two parts: patient genetic study and prenatal genetic diagnosis. Thirty OCA1 patients were subjected to ana lyze TYR gene mutation. Ten pedigrees were included for prenatal genetic diagnosis. One hundred unrelated healthy Chinese individuals were charac terized for controls. The coding sequence and the intron/exon junctions of TYR were analyzed by bidirectional DNA sequencing. Results: Twenty mu tations were identified, four of which were novel. In these thirty OCA1 pati ents, twenty five patients were TYR compound heterozygosity; two patients carried homozygous TYR mutations and three were heterozygous. Among the ten prenatal diagnostic fetuses, three fetuses carried compound hetero geneous mutations; seven carried no mutation or only one allele mutation in TYR and appeared normal at birth. Conclusion: We identified four novel TYR mutations and showed that molecular based prenatal screening to de tect TYR mutation in a fetus at risk for OCA1 provided essential information for genetic counseling of at risk couples.",2014

We report on a 60 yrs. patient with short stature (< 2nd centile), sponta neous eruption of 7 teeth only, fusion of C1 to C4 vertebrae with partial occipito atlantal fusion. Two of her seven siblings presented oligodontia. Standard chromosome analysis in the proband showed a mosaic karyoty pe 45,X[3]/46,XX[27], which may relate with the short stature. Array CGH (60K, Agilent Technologies) showed a Ã¢ÂÂ¼1 Mb duplication encompassing chromosome 7p spanning eight genes (ISPD, SOSTDC1, LRRC72, ANKMY, TSPAN13 , AGR2 and AGR3 ): (arr[hg19] 7p21.2p21.1(15,926,980x2,15,99 4,233 17,074,396x3,17,222,770x2). Real time PCR on available members showed the duplication segregated in the two siblings with oligodontia, but it was absent in one healthy sister. We hypothesize that oligodontia is asso ciated with the duplication of SOSTDC1 (OMIM* 609675), which is a mem ber of the sclerostin family. The protein acts as a bone morphogenetic pro tein (BMP) antagonist. Mice overexpressing Sostdc1 have a reduced number of teeth, whereas Sostdc1 / show an increased number of teeth number and anomalies in teeth morphology. The gene has been demonstrated to ant agonize Wnt signaling in mice. Interestingly, WNT10A mutations have been associated with oligodontia in humans. In conclusion, we speculate that the duplication of SOSTDC1 at chromosome 7p21.2p21.1 may increase its pro tein level leading to oligodontia in our family. SOSTDC1 could be a new can didate gene to be screened in isolated oligodontia.",2014
21144,"PagetÃ¢ÂÂs disease of bone (PDB) is a common bone disease with strong gene tic component. Previous studies have identified a PDB susceptibility locus on chr10p13 tagged by rs1561570 which is located within the OPTN gene (Albagha et al, Nat Genet 2011). OPTN encodes a protein that plays a role in multiple cellular processes including autophagy and NF KB signalling but its role in bone metabolism is yet unclear. Here we investigated the 10p13 locus by targeted DNA sequencing of a 650kb region surrounding the rs1561570 which includes seven genes. A total of 260 samples were sequenced inclu ding unrelated cases and controls, 60 familial cases and controls. All cases were negative for SQSTM1 mutations. Target capture was performed using Haloplex kit followed by DNA sequencing using the illumina Hiseq2000 platform. Variants passing quality control measures were filtered to include only rare coding (MAF<0.01 in 1000Genome) or regulatory variants (as pre dicted by ENCODE). No disease specific missense mutations were detected in any of the seven genes located in this region including OPTN . However, we identified a novel rare variant located in the OPTN promoter which was found to alter NF KB transcription factor binding site. This novel variant had a high call quality (Q>4200, read depth >150) and was not present in the public databases including 1000 genomes and showed transmission from an affected father to an affected daughter and the unaffected mother did not carry this mutation. In conclusion our data suggest that rare regulatory variants within OPTN influence PDB susceptibility.",2014

Nonsyndromic cleft lip with or without cleft palate (nsCL/P) has a genetical ly complex etiology. In recent years, several genome wide significant suscep tibility loci for nsCL/P were identified, most of them by genome wide asso ciation studies. However, most studies have been performed in populations from Europe and Asia, and few data are available concerning genetic sus ceptibility to nsCL/P in Arabic populations. The present study investigated a newly recruited nsCL/P sample from Yemen. Twenty four single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) representing all 15 currently known nsCL/P risk loci were genotyped in 242 nsCL/P cases and 420 healthy controls. Single mar ker association analysis revealed significant associations for four loci (8q24, 9q22, 10q25, 13q31). The strongest association was for the European high risk locus at 8q24 (P corrected , 5.09x10 4; heterozygous odds ratio (ORhet) , 1.74, 95% confidence interval (CI 95% CI) , 1.22 2.47, homozygous odds ratio (ORhom) , 2.47, CI 95% , 1.55 3.93). Five additional loci (1q32.2, 3q12, 8q21, 17q22, 20q12) showed nominal significance that did not withstand correction for multiple testing. Two loci (1p36, 2p21) failed to reach no minal significance but displayed a trend towards association with P < 0.1. Although the four remaining loci (1p22, 3p11, 15q22, 17p13) failed to reach nominal significance, the risk alleles were in the same direction as in the dis covery studies. Our results suggest that four of the 15 analyzed nsCL/P risk loci which were identified in European and Asian ethnicities significantly confer risk for nsCL/P in Arab populations.",2014
21146,"Bone morphogenetic protein 1 (BMP1) is an astacin metalloprotease with manifold roles in morphogenesis and diverse substrates. Besides its role as procollagen C proteinase for the major fibrillar collagens (types I, II and III) and its participation in N propeptide removal of the minor fibrillar colla gens (types V and XI), BMP1 is involved in the proteolytic trimming of mul tiple other substrates including a.o. small leucine rich proteoglycans (e.g. decorin). Mutations in BMP1 have recently been identified in three families with a severe, autosomal recessive form of osteogenesis imperfecta (OI). We report novel, bi allelic mutations in two unrelated adult patients with severe OI, characterized by severe osteoporosis with numerous fractures, short sta ture with limb deformities and severe kyphoscoliosis. Biochemical analysis of secreted (pro)collagens showed defective type I procollagen C propepti de processing. Immunofluorescent staining of type I and V collagen secreted by the patientsÃ¢ÂÂ dermal fibroblast cultures showed a reduced and abnormal collagen deposition in the extracellular matrix (ECM). In addition, the redu ced BMP1 activity was shown to result in deficient proteolytic trimming of decorin, an important regulator of collagen fibril organisation, leading to the retention of its propeptide. Ultrastructural analysis showed marked variabi lity in collagen fibril diameter and uneven interfibrillar spaces. Overall, this indicates that BMP1 defects result in disturbed collagen deposition in the ECM. Besides the defective procollagen processing, it is likely that deficient cleavage of other BMP1 substrates contributes to abnormal ECM assembly and signalling, and as such to the phenotypic severity.",2014

The clinical spectrum is strongly heterogeneous with a wide intrafamilial and interfamilial variability; a continuum ranging from nearly asymptomatic individuals with occasional fractures, normal stature and lifespan, to lethal phenotypes characterized by severe skeletal fragility, deformity and growth deficiency. Affected patients may also show blue sclerae, hearing deficit, dentinogenesis imperfecta, cardiac lesions and joint hyperlaxity. Actually more than 1100 COL1A1/A2 distinct variants associated with dominant OI have been identified without hot spot regions; most of the mutations are glycine substitutions followed by splice site alterations and nonsense mutations. Despite the identification of many mutations, few ge notype phenotype correlation studies have been performed and there are no unambiguous and clear indications. To evaluate whether the severity and specific clinical manifestations of disease are linked with a specific genetic background we performed a ge notype phenotype correlation study analyzing an Italian case study of 300 patients. All patients have a clinical and radiographic diagnosis of OI from mild to lethal perinatal forms, according with Sillence clinical classification.

The mutations of these genes affect collagen type I synthesis (chains A1 and A2) and the vast majority of the mutations in these two genes follows AD pattern of inheri tance.

The clinical features of 4,5 year old boy represented a very low stature (18 cm below 3.Percentile), history of both femurs and upper arm fractures in early in fancy, slight skeletal deformities and disproportions, inability to stand or walk without support, slightly blue scleras and dentinogenesis imperfecta. Mental status was age appropriate. Although the parents initially denied any health problems (both were 160 cm tall and healthy), after repeated questioning they admitted a history of possible femur and arm fractures in young age (the mother) and one fractu re after fall (the father).

21149,"Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) type V is caused by a recurrent dominant mu tation (c. 14C>T) in IFITM5 , which encodes BRIL, a transmembrane ifitm like protein strongly expressed in osteoblasts, while type VI OI is caused by recessive null mutations in SERPINF1 , encoding pigment epithelium deri ved factor (PEDF). We identified a 25 year old woman with severe OI, with normal serum PEDF but absent PEDF secretion by cultured osteoblasts. Her SERPINF1 sequences were normal despite bone histomorphometry typical of type VI OI. Whole exome sequencing of the proband, parents and an un affected sibling revealed a de novo IFITM5 mutation in one allele of the pro band, causing a p. S40L substitution in the BRIL intracellular domain. IFITM5 expression was normal in proband fibroblasts and osteoblasts, as was BRIL protein level in proband osteoblasts on western blot and in permeabilized proband osteoblasts by microscopy. Notably, SERPINF1 expression was de creased in proband osteoblasts and PEDF was barely detectable in conditio ned media of proband cells. Expression and secretion of type I collagen was similarly decreased in proband osteoblasts, confirming this OI as collagen related. Osteoblasts with the S40L mutation also had decreased expression of ALP and osteocalcin, as seen in primary PEDF defects. In contrast, osteo blasts from classical type V OI have increased SERPINF1 expression and PEDF secretion during differentiation. These data suggest (1) that the type V OI and p. S40L BRIL are gain and loss of function mutations, respectively, and (2) that BRIL and PEDF have a relationship that connects the genes for types V and VI OI and their roles in bone mineralization.

Sin ce molecular analysis of COL1A1 and COL1A2 genes were negative for the presence of causative mutations, a SNP array analysis was performed using the Illumina Infinium SNP genotyping platform (HumanOmniExpress 12 chips and BeadStation Scanner) in order to detect regions of homozygosity encompassing genes known to be involved in AR OI. The analysis revealed one homozygous region larger than 2 Mb (chr9:107,793,426 109,935,841) overlapping with the TMEM38B locus and characterized by a 35 Kb homo zygous deletion spanning from marker rs1567368 to rs9408800 and invol ving exons 1 and 2 of TMEM38B gene. A long PCR amplification confirmed this finding. Eventually, we postulated that the deletion was promoted by the presence of repeated sequences in the segments before and after the breaking points.

Background. Osteogenesis Imperfecta (OI) is a heritable disease of connec tive tissue characterized by abnormal bone mineralization and skeletal de formities. Objective. This study investigate the osteoclastogenic potential of unfractioned peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( PBMCs) from OI patients ( mean age 10,44+/ 3,48) who received cyclical neridronate infusions for at least 1 year, untreated OI patients and control subjects. Methods. PBMCs from 6 patients and 6 controls were cultured in presence/absence of M CSF and RANKL. At the end of the culture period, mature multinucleated osteo clasts (Ocs) were identified as TRAP+ cells. By real time PCR we studied gene expression in freshly isolated PBMC. By flow cytometry we characte rized the presence of OC precursors ( CD14+/CD16+) and TNF ÃÂ± expressi on. Results. Spontaneous OC formation, without adding M CSF and RANKL, occurred in PBMC cultures from treated and untreated OI patients. In these patients, the percentage of circulating OC precursors, increased respect to the controls ( 12,5% vs 0,1%, p< 0,01). By real time PCR, we found high levels of RANKL, TNF ÃÂ± and MSCF receptor, as well as decreased OPG levels, thus leading to the increase of RANKL/OPG ratio. High TNF ÃÂ± levels were also found on monocytes through flow citometry. Conclusion.

21152,"We carried out a genome wide association study (GWAS) on skin color in 6,000 Dutch Europeans followed by successful replications in thousands of Europeans from Australia and UK. We identified a total of five distinct geno mic regions showing genome wide significant association with continuous or categorical skin color phenotypes all including known pigmentation genes: 5p13.2 SLC45A2; 6p25.3 IRF4; 15q13.1 OCA2 and HERC2; 16q24.3 MC1R; and 20q11.22 ASIP . The role of 20q11.22 in skin coloration has been much less clear than other genes/regions. In this large region (spanning ~ 1.5Mb), the top associated DNA variant was rs6059655 (P,4.2e 13) in RALY. All other associated SNPs in this region were all in linkage disequi librium with rs6059655 (r2>0.4). Among these are rs1885120 in MYH7B and rs910873 in PIGU that have been previously associated with risk of me lanoma. Additional transcriptional analysis of 20 genes from 20q11.2 in 29 human skin epidermis samples highlighted RALY as well as other regional genes such as EIF2S2, ITCH and GSS with significant (P<0.01) expression differences between light and dark pigmented skin samples. A multivari ate analysis highlighted 9 pigmentation genes (i.e. OCA2 HERC2, IRF4, SL C45A2, MC1R, RALY/ASIP , TYR, BNC2, SLC24A4, and SLC24A5 in a descen ding order) jointly explaining 16.3% phenotypic variance of perceived skin darkness in Europeans. The weighted allele sums showed a spatial pattern that is clearly correlated with latitude in Europe, but much less so in the rest of the world, suggesting that variants responsible for skin color variation between Asians and Africans are not included here.",2014
21153,"We identified PRINS (Psoriasis susceptibility Related non coding RNA Indu ced by Stress) and showed that it is highest expressed in the psoriatic un involved epidermis. According to the results of in vitro experiments PRINS expression is induced by various stessors such as UVB, translation inhibiti on and microbial agents. It has been previously demonstarted by us and by others that keratinocytes of the psoriatic uninvolved epidermis possess an abnormal response to various stressors and respond with hyperproliferati on. Therefore we aimed to understand how the altered expression of PRINS in the uninvolved epidermis contributes to the aberrant stress response of the keratinocytes thus to disease susceptibility. To this end we identified a chaperon protein, nucleophosmin (NPM) as a direct interacting partner of PRINS. We could demonstrate that UV B irradiation induced the shuttling of NPM from the nucleolus to the nucleoplasm and silencing of the PRINS non coding RNA in the UV B irradiated keratinocytes resulted in the retention of NPM in the nucleolus. These results suggest that PRINS is physically and functionally linked to NPM, thus it plays a role in the NPM mediated cellu lar stress response. In an other set of experiments we have demonstrated that PRINS signals independently from the NF kappaB signal trasduction pathway, however its expression was induced when the keratinocytes were treated with the inflammasome activating poly(dA:dT).Our results indicate that the PRINS non coding RNA is part of a ribonucleo complex. Its altered expression in psoriatic uninvolved epidermis could con tribute to the well established aberrant stress response of psoriatic kerati nocytes and as a consequence to psoriasis susceptibility.",2014
21154,"We describe a 40 years old man from Albania with clinically evident hema turia and proteinuria; renal function was normal. The peculiar renal CT fin dings were: small multiple calcifications at the cortical junction bilaterally. The pedigree analysis revealed two sisters affected by an unspecified skin disease; no consanguinity was reported in the family. The clinical genetic examination showed yellowish papules of the skin on the neck. The asso ciation of renal calcifications in a young patient with skin lesions and the recurrence of a skin disease in the family led us to take into account Pseu doxanthoma elasticum (PXE). Therefore an ocular examination looking for signs of the disease was performed and angioid streaks radiating from the peripapillary area without subretinal neovascularization signs were detec ted. Pseudoxanthoma elasticum (PXE), is a rare multisystem disease cha racterized by degeneration and calcification of elastic fibres and blood ves sels. The causative gene is ABCC6, mapped on chromosome 16p13.1, which encodes an ABC transporter protein (ABCC6) expressed primarily in liver and the kidneys. Patients typically develop cutaneous, ocular, cardiovascular and gastrointestinal manifestations. The molecular analysis of the ABCC6 gene detected a homozygous deletion of exons 23 29 (del23_29); this is the most common deletion described in literature associated to PXE, resulting in a premature stop codon with loss of 505 amino acids of MRP6 protein. Although this renal pattern cannot be considered specific for the diagnosis of PXE, we recommend to test PXE when both renal and skin abnormalities are present in a patient.",2014

Psoriatic arthritis (PsA, OMIM #607507) is a chronic inflammatory disorder presenting a highly heterogeneous phenotype and clinical course. PsA is a multifactorial disease associated with psoriasis, affecting the 30% of pati ents with psoriasis vulgaris (PsV).Some genetic risk factors are specific for the arthropaty, other are shared with PsV (HLA Cw*06:02, LCE, TNFÃÂ± and TRAF3IP2). On this subject, dif ferent European studies have recently found several susceptibility genes, which are involved in the inflammatory and immunologic pathways of the disease. To date, no associations between PsA and genes involved in bone metabo lism have been observed. Thus we decided to screen a list of genes involved in bone metabolism and/or osteogenesis. We have carried out this screening in 429 PsA patients and 417 health, 380 PsV cases and 389 controls. A single nucleotide polymorphism rs2897442 (A/G) showed a significant associati on in PsA cases (p , 0.006; OR , 0.73, 95% CI 0.59 0.92). Interestingly , it is not associated to PsV but only in PsA. The rs2897442 is located in the 8th intron of KIF3A gene (5q21), which encodes for a kinesin II complex subunit required for the assembly of primary ciclia and involved in bone formation and in keratinocyte differentiation. Full resequencing of coding and regula tory regions failed to reveal evidence of further association. LD pattern does not reveal significant haplotypes associated to PsA. Immunohistochemistry analyses, as well as replication in an independent data set of patients, are expected to clarify the functional role of KIF3A in the pathogenesis and de velopment of PsA.",2014

Collagenopathies and osteodysplasies constitute a genetically heteroge neous group of diseases with low incidence, representing however an im portant health problem because patients require continuous specialized care, due to their deteriorating quality of life. The molecular diagnosis is essential to confirm clinical suspicion, but is not straightforward due to the high number of candidate genes. NGS targeted re sequencing is a fast and cost effective alternative to Sanger sequencing, as it can sequence all the genes involved in disease development. We designed a NGS targeted re sequencing panel for 229 genes associated with skeletal dysplasias, which spans 1.5Mb comprising coding exons, splice sites and 5Ã¢ÂÂ and 3Ã¢ÂÂ untranslated regions. Once panel was validated for dia gnostic use testing HapMap cell lines, these regions were sequenced in 40 patients with clinical suspicion of these pathologies. Target regions were en riched and captured using the Enrichment SureSelect system (Agilent) and sequenced either with a SOLiD 5500 (Life Technologies) or MiSeq (Illumina) platform. Results were confirmed by Sanger sequencing. The analysis identified 47 variants in 24 patients, of which 8 were classi fied as disease causing and 4 as probably pathogenic. Both types of variants were either truncating mutations or glycine substitutions in collagen genes (essential for collagen structure). The identification of these mutations al lowed the molecular diagnosis and an appropriate genetic counseling in affected families. Targeted re sequencing is especially suited to highly hete rogeneous diseases such as skeletal dysplasias, because it allows the identi fication of mutations in genes whose study by traditional sequencing would be difficult and expensive, increasing diagnostic time.",2014

The clinical phenotype has worsened with age as many other symptoms appeared (asthenia, severe anemia, C3 and C4 decrease; urticari al dermatitis; microscopic hematuria, petechiae; glomerulonephritis; sple nic strokes; interstitial pneumopathy, pulmonary hypertension; mesenteric ischemia). Interestingly, we also observed joint hyperlaxity with a peculiar apparent contractions of interphalangeal joints (manually extendable wit hout difficulties).

21160,"Spondyloenchondrodysplasia (SPENCD) is an AR spondylometaphyseal dysplasia characterized by radiolucent spondylar and metaphyseal lesions, whose patients can also present neurological and immunological changes. It is caused by mutations in ACP5, a gene encoding the tartrate resistant acid phophatase. Considering that just 24 individuals with mutations on this gene were described so far, and the great clinical heterogeneity of this condition, the unusual pattern of a new family prompted us to present the se Brazilian patients. The proband is the third child of non consanguineous parents. At birth he presented mild hydrocephalus, esophageal atresia wi thout fistula, and absence of right kidney. None radiological evidence of skeletal dysplasia was present. At the age of 6 it was observed short stature ( 3SD), mental retardation and skeletal changes compatible with SPENCD. Complementary investigations showed normal CGHa and sequencing of the TRPV4, no calcification in the CNS, and autoimmune hypothyroidism. The radiological evaluation of his sister (19 yo) and his maternal uncle (34 yo) due to mild disproportionate short stature showed similar aspect of the spi ne without, however, other skeletal involvement. The probandÃÂ´s mother has vitiligo without skeletal changes. By direct sequencing of the ACP5 a homo zygous mutation (c.791T>A) was identified in the proband, his sister and his maternal uncle. The parents were heterozygous. We conclude that the proband has a pattern of malformation not associated with the SPENCD dia gnosis; unlike the metaphyseal, spine involvement seem to be permanent; the homozygosity strongly suggest a high inbreeding in this family, and the motherÃÂ´s vitiligo could suggest a heterozygous manifestation.",2014

SHFM occurs either as an isolated trait or part of a multiple congenital anomaly syndro me. The genetic origin of approximately 50% cases is still unknown. The main objective of this study was to identify submicroscopic genomic rear rangements in a group of 30 probands affected by isolated or syndromic SHFM with use of high resolution array based comparative genomic hybri dization (aCGH). All probands were previously screened for the most com mon SHFM related genetic lesions (i.e. 10q24.32 and 17p13.3 duplications, TP63 mutations). Results of aCGH in one family with isolated SHFM showed a pathogenic deletion in SHFM1 (7q21.3) locus, much smaller than typical causative changes identified in this region.

These two syndromes are caused by different types of mutations in the gene: loss of function mu tations (splice site or deletion) have been found in 2 IFAH families, while missense mutations have been found in 2 ARIH probands. We report on the identification of a new homozygous disease causing mutation in ST14 in a girl with diffuse ichthyosiform scaling of the trunk and arms, follicular atro phoderma of both forearms and sparse hair. The screening of ST14 by San ger sequencing revealed a homozygous missense mutation, p. Glu519Gln, inherited by healthy parents, both carriers of the variation described. The mutation is not present in 1000Genomes nor in ESP databases, involves a highly conserved aminoacid and is predicted to be pathogenic by Polyphen2 and SIFT . ST14 encodes the matriptase, a type II transmembrane serine pro tease, expressed predominantly in the epithelial cells of the surface lining epithelium.

The preaxial polydactyly represents a complete or partial duplication of the thumb, usually is unilateral. The thumb duplication is ABSTRACTS POSTERS ESHG 2014 | MILAN, ITALY | WWW. ESHG. ORG 112Back to inde x the most common anomaly of the hand. This congenital anomaly may be isolated and sporadic or expressed with a syndromeÃ¢ÂÂs phenotype. Within the Oberg, Manske, Tonkin (OMT) classification thumb duplications are a failure of formation and/or differentiation affecting the radial/ulnar axis of the hand plate. The primary signal centre involved is the zone of polarising activity (ZPA) in the posterior part of the developing limb bud. Sonic Hedge hog protein, which is expressed in the ZPA, plays a major role in determi ning radial ulnar characteristics. Other morphogens are involved in the de velopment of thumb duplications. Instead for an approach of management the Wassel description is used. Case report. We describe a case of a female newborn with a isolated hand left preaxial polydactyly. The weight at birth was 2050g, 45 cm of lenght and head circumference 33 cm, physical exami nation revealed preaxial hexadactyly with thumb duplication. Extra digit was mild hypoplasic and the patient was unable to move it independently. Radiographs showed extra thumb containing two proximal phalanges (type IV polydactyly, according to the WasselÃ¢ÂÂs Classification). Conclusion. In this condition are recommended to value radiographs of the affected limb to show whether the rudimentary digit contains skeletal elements, and any as sociated non hand anomalies. Surgical reconstruction of the radial polydac tyly is indicated, not only for the obvious cosmetic improvement, but also to obtain a stable, mobile thumb of adequate size and appropriate shape.",2014
21173,"Background: Thrombophilia is a multifactorial disorder which arises from the interaction of acquired and genetic risk factors. Despite the significant effort made to understand the etiology of this disease, there are still a cer tain number of patients suffering from idiopathic thrombophilia. Objectives: The aim of this study was to screen 3Ã¢ÂÂ end of prothrombin gene, which is susceptible for gain of function mutations due to its non canonical sequence elements, in patients with idiopathic thrombophilia and to deter mine its eventual role in the pathogenesis of thrombophilia. Material and Methods: This study was carried out in100 patients with idio pathic thrombophilia and 100 healthy controls DNA variants in the 715bp long region of the 3Ã¢ÂÂend of the prothrombin gene were identified by sequen cing. Results: In our study, we detected two variants: A19911G and C20068T . The frequency of A19911G gene variant was slightly increased in the group of patients compared to controls. Heterozygous carriers of FII C20068T were four times more frequent in the patients (4%) than in controls (1%), but this difference did not reach statistical significance. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that variant A19911G is not a significant risk factor (OR,1.05; 95%CI 0.57 1.93), while C20068T may represent a po tential risk factor for idiopathic thrombophilia (OR,4.12; 95%CI 0.57 1.93). To confirm our results, further studies should be conducted in a larger co hort of patients.",2014
21174,"The role of aortic aneurysm syndromes genes in abdominal aorta aneurys ms (AAA) was investigated by analysing the TGF ÃÂ² pathway genes TGFBR1 , TGFBR2 , SMAD3 , FBN1, EFEMP2, smooth muscle cells genes MYH11, MYLK and ACTA2 and the vascular Ehlers Danlos gene COL3A1 in a large group of familial and sporadic AAA patients. Sanger sequencing was performed of all coding exons and exon intron boundaries of the aneurysm genes in AAA patients diagnosed. Patients with at least one affected first degree relative with an aortic aneurysm were clas sified as familial AAA (fAAA). In silico analysis was used for assessment of the clinical significance of the variants. We found 38 different variants of unknown clinical significance (VUS) in this study population of 72 AAA patients including 56 fAAA patients (78%) and 16 patients (22%) with sporadic AAA. In fAAA one null mutation in COL3A1 and 48 VUS were observed in 26 (46%) patients. In sporadic AAA one de novo TGFBR2 mutation and 11 VUS were observed in 8 (50%) patients. Four VUS (11%) were possibly pathogenic; TGFBR2 c.1234G>A (Val412Met), MYH11 c.760C>T (Arg254Cys), MYH11 c.5697G>C (Glu1899Asp), and MYLK c.3403G>A (Gly1135Arg). Fifteen patients (13 familial and 2 two sporadic) had complex genotypes, including seven in cis variants. Altogether 3% of the AAA patients had a pathogenic mutation and 24 (47%) one or more VUS. The results endorse the genetic heterogeneity of AAA, showing a modest contribution of TGFBR2 and COL3A1 in AAA. In addition a high prevalence of rare VUS suggests involvement of other aneurysm genes in AAA.",2014
21175,"Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is multi factorial disease with life th reatening complications due to mainly asymptomatic course of develop ment. Vascular inflammation induced by oxidative stress contribute to pa thogenesis. Inter individual differences in response to oxidative stress are partially under genetic control. In this study the associations between the functional SNPs and (GT)n repeat length polymorphisms in genes involved in the vascular response to hypoxia/ischemia: HIF1A (hypoxia inducible factor 1ÃÂ±) and HMOX1 (heme oxygenase 1) and the development of AAA were examined. The study encompassed a series of 518 AAA patients, 345 patients with atherosclerotic aortoiliac occlusive disease (AOID) and 498 controls. The HIF1A rs11549465C>T , rs11549467G>A and HMOX1 rs2071746A>T SNP genotyping was performed by using predesigned TaqMan SNP genotyping assays. For simultaneous assessment of the HIF1A and HMOX1 (GT)n poly morphisms, the method based on multiplex PCR with fluorescent labeled sense primers and fragment size analysis using DNA sequencer has been developed. We found, that carriers of the HMOX1 (GT)n repeat long allele (n>27) had increased risk of developing AAA (OR,1.46 for dominant model, P,.034). The frequency of carriers of both HMOX1 risk alleles: rs2071746T and/or long (GT)n repeat in AAAs (58,5%) was higher as compared to AIOD (49,0%, P,.007). On the other hand, the frequency of noncarriers in AAAs was 0.0%, as compared to 1.3% in controls (P,.010) and 0.9% in AIOD (P,.066). In conclusion, HMOX1 gene promoter long (GT)n repeat allele and rs2071746T , allele related to decreased anti inflammatory and antioxidant capacity of heme oxygenase 1, are associated with abdominal aortic aneu rysm.

21176,"Background: Long QT Syndrome (LQTS) is an inherited arrhytmogenic disea se characterized by a prolonged QT interval in association with life threate ning arrhythmias. The LQTS can be congenital (cLQTS) or acquired (aLQTS) as an adverse response to drugs, hypokalemia or bradycardia. Mutations in 13 genes have been associated with cLQTS, while the genetic background of aLQTS remains unclear. The aim was therefore to evaluate if a genetic substrate may contribute to aLQTS. Methods: Through a multicentre study, 211 aLQTS probands were collected from Japan, Italy and France. They were clinically evaluated and divided into 3 groups according to the baseline QTc interval: Ã¢ÂÂtrue aLQTSÃ¢ÂÂ (females QTc<460ms, males QTc<450ms, n,112), Ã¢ÂÂunmasked LQTSÃ¢ÂÂ (females QTc Ã¢ÂÂ¥ 460ms, males QTc Ã¢ÂÂ¥ 450ms, n,74), and Ã¢ÂÂunclassified LQTSÃ¢ÂÂ (without ECG, n,25). Genetic screening of the 5 major cLQTS genes was performed and mutations were compared to those of 875 genotyped cLQTS families. Results: Genetic analysis led to the identificati on of mutations in LQTS susceptibility genes in 27% of aLQTS probands (57/211). In the Ã¢ÂÂtrue aLQTSÃ¢ÂÂ and Ã¢ÂÂunmasked LQTSÃ¢ÂÂ, a mutation was de tected in 23% and 38% of cases, respectively (p,0.04). Interestingly, KCNH2 was the most mutated gene (62% vs 15% of KCNQ1), while the frequency of mutations in the cLQTS population were 39% and 48%, respectively. Con clusions: Genes implicated in cLQTS play an important role also in aLQTS. The likely underlying mechanism would be a critical loss in repolarizati on reserve even in the presence of just a modest QT interval prolongation. KCNH2 mutations seem to have a prominent role.",2014
21177,"AnneÃ¢ÂÂs University Hospital Brno, Brno, Czech Republic. Introduction:Angiotensinogen (AGT) is a key component of the renin angiotensin aldo sterone system that plays a crucial role in blood pressure (BP) regulation. Increased BP is a well known risc factor for various cardiovascular diseases. With the discovery of microRNAs, polymorphisms in 3ÃÂ´ untranslated regi ons (3ÃÂ´ UTR) of known genes became of interest. The aim of our study was to investigate the possible association of rs7079 in 3ÃÂ´ UTR of AGT gene with the outcomes in patients after myocardial infarction (MI).Methods:Total of 652 patients (men) presenting at the emergency room with chest pain with suspicious MI underwent selective coronarography. Diagnosis of MI was confirmed in 571 patients. Peripheral blood for DNA isolation was sampled during hospitalization and the genotypes were determined using TaqMan Genotyping Assay. Results:Statistically significant differences in age at onset of the first MI were obser ved among the genotypes of investigated polymorphism, the homozygote genotypes preseting with MI at younger age (AA/CC vs. AC; 58.3ÃÂ±9.7 years vs. 59.91ÃÂ±9.62 years, p , 0.04). Furthermore, statistically significant asso ciation was found between the occurrence of restenosis and AGT genotypes (p , 0.008). The logistic regression model revealed that the CC and AA ho mozygotes were at the higher risk of restenosis before 45 years of age com pared to AC heterozygotes. Conclusion: Our study shows that rs7079 homozygotes present with MI at younger age and that the risk of restenosis is higher in these patients. This may be par tially explained by altered miR 30 and miR 584 binding to 3ÃÂ´UTR region of AGT , as shown previously.",2014
21178,"Aortopathies are characterized by aneurysms, dissections, dilation, and tor tuosity of predominantly the thoracic aorta (TAA) but also the abdominal aorta. Inherited forms comprising both syndromic and non syndromic enti ties are genetically heterogeneous and phenotypically overlapping. Current ly, mutations in at least 15 genes are known to cause familial thoracic aor tic aneurysms (AAT3 AAT8), as well as dominant and recessive syndromic aortopathies. Molecular testing is impeded by similar phenotypes caused by mutations in different genes and mutations in the same gene leading to a wide clinical variability. In this setting NGS of an aortopathy gene panel offers an efficient alternative to conventional gene by gene Sanger sequen cing. We developed a NGS aortopathy multigene panel encompassing 15 genes (ACTA2, COL3A1, EFEMP2, ELN, FBN1, FLNA, MYH11, MYLK, NOTCH1, PRKG1, SLC2A10, SMAD3, TGFB2, TGFBR1 and TGFBR2). Coding and adja cent intronic regions were analyzed using Nextera Rapid Capture Custom Enrichment and 2x150 bp paired end sequencing on a MiSeq instrument (Illumina). So far, the analysis of 20 patients with both syndromic and non syndromic aortic disease identified eight disease causing mutations in seven patients in the genes COL3A1, EFEMP2 (compound heterozygous), FBN1 (2x), SMAD3, TGFB2 and TGFBR2, representing a diagnostic sensitivity of 35%. Additionally, two rare variants of unknown clinical significance were identified in the MYH11 and TGFB2 gene. Surprisingly, two patients with FBN1 and TGFB2 mutations were clinically diagnosed with vascular Ehlers Danlos syndrome supported by ultrastructural findings of a skin biopsy. In conclusion, patients with aortopathies will benefit from a parallel testing approach enabling efficient and appropriate surveillance and intervention measures.",2014

The objective of this work was to examine the association between ApoE gene polymorphisms and the risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) in Bulgarians. The case control study was carried out on a total of 725 samp les including 104 patients with angiographically verified coronary artery disease,151 patients with myocardial infarction and 470 population controls without data for cardiovascular complications. ApoE gene polymorphis ms were genotyped by High Resolution Melting Analysis. The differences in allele frequency between the CHD patients and controls were evaluated with chi square test. The frequencies of ApoE alleles in the CHD subjects were 0.81 for E3, 0.14 for E4 and 0.06 for E2, and in the control group were 0.84 for E3, 0.09 for E4 and 0.07 for E2. The ApoE4 allele frequency was significantly higher in the CHD patients than in the control group (OR,1.68, p,0.002). The carriers of E4 containing genotypes (E2/E4, E3/E4 and E4/E4) had a higher risk to develop CHD than carriers of E2 and E3 contai ning genotypes (OR,1.72, p,0.004).

21180,"Primary electrical disease (PED) encompasses a diversity of syndromes including the Short QT Syndrome, Long QT Syndrome, Brugada Syndrome, Early Repolarization Syndrome, and Catecholaminergic Polymorphic Ven tricular Tachycardia. Each of these disorders predisposes to ventricular arrhythmias (i.e. polymorphic ventricular tachycardia, Torsade de Pointes, bidirectional ventricular tachycardia) that can degenerate into ventricular fibrillation which often results in sudden cardiac death. These disorders are all genetically heterogeneous and a significant phenotypic and genetic overlap exists. This overlap might be a source of misdiagnosis resulting in negative genetic testing. Therefore we suggest to test these patients for all genes involved in these disorders. We developed and optimized a MASTR (Multiplex Amplification of Specific Target for Resequencing) assay comprising 51 genes involved in PED. The MASTR protocol consists of a multiplex PCR whereby a first PCR is perfor med to amplify all target regions followed by a secondary PCR in which pa tient specific barcodes and sequencing adaptors are incorporated. The PED assay consists of 951 amplicons distributed over 11 multiplexes. Following the MASTR assay, 2x250bp sequencing is performed on MiSeq v2. Next, da ta analysis and interpretation is performed using our local Galaxy instance and our in house developed variant database. For validation purposes, 20 CEPH samples (variants present in 1000G) and 20 positive controls were analysed, and we have achieved 100% sensitivity.

21181,"Dominant mutations in genes encoding desmosomal proteins are reported to cause arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy (AC), an inherited heart muscle disease characterized by lethal ventricular arrhythmias and heart failure, accounting for 15 to 25% of cases of sudden cardiac death in patients <35 years. Recessive mutations are infrequent and most of them cause cardio cutaneous syndromes. We report here the identification of the first founder homozygous desmocol lin 2 (DSC2) mutation in the Italian population, segregating in 4 AC families showing a cardiac restricted phenotype. We performed an exon by exon analysis of the DSC2 gene on 80 unrelated Italian index patients diagnosed affected with AC according to revised 2010 Task Force criteria. We identified the p. D179G homozygous mutation in DSC2 gene in 4 (5%) of them, all originating from the same north eastern Italian region. One of them resulted to carry an additional plakophilin 2 frameshift mutation. Haplotype analysis revealed a conserved haplotype among the DSC2 mutation carriers, strongly indicating a common founder. A severe form of biventricular cardiomyopathy with typical electrical features of AC was diagnosed in all homozygous mutation carriers, whereas hete rozygous family members were clinically asymptomatic. In vitro functional studies on HL 1 cells showed that mutated DSC2 protein correctly localizes at the intercalated discs. In conclusion, this is the first founder homozygous mutation in DSC2 gene invariably associated with a severe AC phenotype in the Italian population. This finding could have important implications for mutation screening stra tegy and risk stratification.",2014

Genetic testing is limited to genes encoding desmosomal components resul ting in a diagnostic yield of about 50%. Aim: The aim of this study is to search copy number variations (CNVs) in the plakophilin 2 gene (PKP2 ) in order to increase the mutational detection in ACM. Methods: Genetic screening for all 5 desmosomal encoding genes was car ried out in 60 unrelated patients with a clinical diagnosis of ACM by Sanger sequencing on a ABI PRISM 3730 (Life Technologies). Genotype negative probands underwent Multiplex Ligation dependent Probe Amplification (MLPA) using SALSA MLPA kit P168 ARVC PKP2 (MRC Holland) and quanti tative Real Time PCR (qPCR) on a Light Cycler 480 (Roche Applied Science) in search of large deletions/duplications in PKP2. Results: 60% of ACM patients (n,36) resulted positive on direct sequen cing, showing 5 mutations in Desmoglein 2 gene (8%), 14 in Desmoplakin (23%), 7 in PKP2 (12%), 2 in Desmocollin 2 (3%), 2 in Plakoglobin (3%) and 6 patients (10%) carried multiple mutations. Additional screening by MLPA in patients without mutations in ACM genes successfully identified a large heterozygous PKP2 deletion, further confirmed by qPCR showing a PKP2 copy number reduction when compared to control samples. Conclusions: This study improved the diagnostic genetic yield in our popu lation by nearly 2% for one gene, highlighting the usefulness of performing additional analysis for CNVs in ACM patients.",2014

Compound/digenic heterozygosity has been identified as one of the most important determinants of malignant arrhythmic outcome in arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy (AC). The impact of two single nucleoti de variations (SNV) in the AC phenotype expression in a small family was assessed. Methods. Autopsy identified a concealed left dominant AC in a 40 years old competitive athlete. Conventional genetic screening for all desmosomal re lated AC genes and parallel exome sequencing was carried out. SNV segrega tion and disease penetrance was further assessed in the family members. Results. By exome and conventional sequencing two SNVs in different desmo somal genes were identified in the proband: one in exon 14 of DSG2, c.2137 G>A (rs79241126, E713K), previously reported in AC cases as an Ã¢ÂÂuncertainÃ¢ÂÂ variant with minor allele frequency (MAF) equals to 0.037; and the other SNV in exon 16 of DSC2, c.2603 C>T (rs141873745, S868F), considered a variant Ã¢ÂÂlikely to be pathogenicÃ¢ÂÂ since can alter the functional properties of the protein, has no available reported MAF and in silico analysis predicted a malignant outcome (Polyphen 2: malignant, SIFT: probably deleterious).Cascade genetic screening showed that all relatives were carriers for only one of the two SNVs. The brother and the sister, SNV carriers, showed a less severe AC phenotype with septal and LV late enhancement at cardiac ma gnetic resonance. Conclusions. The data herein reported confirm that digenic heterozygosity predicts a more severe phenotype and arrhythmic outcome in AC. However, the risk conferred by SNV in family members needs to be evaluated further by follow up studies.",2014

A hot spot of DSG2 missense mutations targets the consensus cleavage site of DSG2 pro peptide (Arg X Arg/Lys Arg) by Kex2 like proprotein converta ses. These mutations are responsible for severe phenotype associating fre quent severe right ventricular dysfunction and left ventricular involvement. In the present work, we aim to explore the pathophysiological mechanisms of these mutations. Methods and ResultsWe performed ex vivo analysis on heart samples from two mutation car riers, and in vitro analysis by expressing wild type (WT) or mutants pro DSG2 GFP fusion proteins in cellular models. First, we demonstrated that all mutations prevented N terminal propeptide cleavage. Using Biacore tech nology, we demonstrated that the presence of propeptide led to the loss of interactions between EC1 domains of cadherins, known to interact to struc ture desmosomes. Uncleaved pro DSG2 mutants were correctly addressed to the intercellular junctions (cellular models) or at the intercalated disks (human tissue). However, we observed at low calcium concentration a mis incorporation of pro DSG2 mutants into desmosomes associated with an EGFR dependant internalization of pro DSG2 mutants and of desmosomal partners (Plakophillin 2 and Plakoglobin) suggesting increased turn over of the unprocessed pro DSG2. Mutants mis incorporation in desmosomes was further confirmed by western blot in cells submitted to cyclic mechanical stress showing an increase in mutant pro DSG2 in the desmosome indepen dent soluble fraction as compared to DSG2 WT . Conclusion Our results strongly suggest a loss in desmosomal adhesiveness due to mis incorporation of uncleaved pro DSG2 mutant into desmosomes that might play a central role in ARVC pathophysiology.",2014
21185,"Aim: Atherosclerotic plaques may vary among individuals, in part due to he ritable factors. However, the genetic architecture of plaque phenotypes is largely unknown. A common variant near PIK3CG on 7q22.3 has previously been associated with carotid plaque presence. Animal models suggest that PIK3CG may play a role in plaque formation through neovascularization. We hypothesized that the PIK3CG variant is associated with intraplaque hemor rhage (IPH) and vessel density in human plaques. Secondarily we focused on characterizing the functional role of genetic variants near PIK3CG in ad vanced human atherosclerosis. Methods: We collected 571 Athero Express Biobank Study patients, and genotyped them using Affymetrix SNP 5.0. After quality control we tested rs17398575 for association to immunohistochemically scored IPH and vessel density, correcting for age, gender and 10 principal components. We used the BiKE cohort to assess the effect of PIK3CG variants on PIK3CG ex pression in circulating monocytes (n,95) and in carotid plaques (n,126).Results: The reported PIK3CG variant, rs17398575 (risk allele A, frequency,0.72), was associated with IPH (OR,1.40 [1.10 1.69 95% CI], p,0.0271) and vessel density (ÃÂ²,0.095 [0.0415 s.e.m.], p,0.0221).The SNP dependent PIK3CG expression demonstrated a differential effect in the vascular wall (p,0.783 for rs17398575) compared to monocytes (p,0.0261 for rs17398575).Conclusion: To our knowledge this is the first report involving the associati on of genetic variants to histological plaque phenotypes in humans.

Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) are a major source of morbidity and morta lity worldwide, including the Azores archipelago where CVD have a higher mortality rate when compared to mainland Portugal. In order to investigate this question, we characterized 15 SNPs in 4 genes and 1 genomic region associated with CVD risk: 4 in PCSK9 (rs11591147, rs11206510, rs562556, rs505151), 4 in APOE (rs405509, rs429358, rs7412, rs439401), 4 in LDLR (rs2228671, rs5927, rs1433099, rs2738466), 1 in USF1 (rs10908821) and 2 in 9p21 (rs10757274, rs1333049). Genotyping was performed by real time PCR using TaqMan Assays in a sample of 170 Azorean and 108 mainland Portuguese healthy individuals. Results demonstrate that allele frequencies were similar in both populations; however, there were statisti cally significant differences for two SNPs: rs10757274 (9p21) and rs405509 (APOE; ÃÂ2, p<0.05). Genotype evaluation of rs1333049 (9p21), the most re plicated risk SNP for CVD, showed that 19.4% and 18.5% of Azoreans and mainland Portuguese, respectively, present homozygosity for this risk allele. Moreover, it is possible to observe that, although there is no statistical signi ficance, Azoreans (9.1%) carry a higher frequency of APOE4 allele compa red to mainland (8.8%). Overall, the results are suggestive of an increased risk for CVDs in Azoreans compared to mainland; however, the joint analysis of all variants is being carried out. Finally, the results validate the need to study regional differences in Portugal, information that should integrate the Portuguese National Health Plan, in order to achieve a more direct and accu rate strategy in terms of prevention and community health.",2014

Background: Brugada syndrome (BrS) is a cardiac channelopathy characte rized by a coved type ST segment elevation in the right precordial leads. The controversy about the value of high intercostal spaces (ICSs) and the num ber of diagnostic leads has been settled by a recent consensus statement. We have tested the validity of the new ECG diagnostic criteria through a multidisciplinary approach, including the molecular one. Methods: We ana lyzed 114 BrS patients with a spontaneous or drug induced type 1 pattern recorded in one or more right precordial leads in 4th, 3rd and 2nd ICSs. The right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT) was localized by echocardiography. Molecular screening of SCN5A was performed through DHPLC and direct sequencing. Results: In total, 23 patients (21%) were carriers of a disease causing mutation. The percentage of mutation carriers (MCs) and the car diac event rate were similar irrespective of the diagnostic ICS (4th vs high ICSs: MCs,23% vs 19%; cardiac event rate 22% vs 28%) and the number of diagnostic leads (1 vs Ã¢ÂÂ¥ 2: MCs 20% vs 22%; cardiac event rate 22% vs 27%) used. The concordance between RVOT anatomical location and the diagno stic ICSs was 86%. Conclusion: The percentage of SCN5A MCs and the car diac event rate are similar regardless of the diagnostic criteria used. The site where the diagnostic pattern is recorded is mainly due to the anatomical location of the RVOT . This study supports the robustness of BrS diagnosis as achieved through the new diagnostic criteria.",2014

In more than 66% of tested families there was an incomplete segregati on of the discovered variant. Revision of all ECG data revealed that some aj maline or baseline ECG negative BrS patients with SCN5A mutations did not meet the stringent diagnostic criteria but demonstrated conduction disease. These results also urge for the need to revise the clinical diagnostic criteria for BrS, in order to stratify BrS patient groups based on more detailed phe notypic data necessary to discover novel major disease associated genes.",2014
21190,"Recent developments of next generation sequencing (NGS) represent a great opportunity to identify new candidate genes in genetically heterogeneous pathologies such as Brugada Syndrome (BrS), an inherited cardiac arrhyth mogenic disorder with a prevalence of 1:5000 in Western countries leading to sudden cardiac arrest in young asymptomatic adults. Until now BrS ge netic background remained elusive, since mutations in known genes cover approximately 30% of patients. We thus aimed at identifying new candidate genes performing targeted NGS in a cohort of 91 BrS patients. The coding regions of 158 genes were sequenced using the Illumina GAIIx platform, yielding a mean target coverage of 99.16% and a mean sequencing depth of 327.22x among the samples. Excluding all common polymorphisms and considering only protein coding variations, we overall identified 98 novel variants in 71 subjects in a total of 70 genes, including missense, nonsense, splice site and INDELs, and 33 clinical rs annotated in dbSNP137. To select more promising BS candidate genes, we then compared the mutational rate of each gene to that observed in repeated random sampling of healthy con trols from 1000 genomes project data. Besides confirming an important role for sodium, potassium and calcium ion channels, our results identified new candidate BrS genes previously associated with other forms of inherited cardiopathies, such as ANK2, RYR2, DSG2, LMNA, suggesting an overlap bet ween different disorders; however, many patients still remained genetically uncharacterized, prompting more extensive studies and suggesting a pos sible multigenic aetiology.",2014
21191,"Genome wide association studies (GWAS) have identified hundreds of sus ceptibility loci for chronic and inflammatory disease phenotypes in humans. There is increasing evidence that chronic inflammation is a crucial driver in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular diseases (CVD), which may be genetical ly determined. To understand the genetic architecture underlying chronic inflammation and CVD we performed a systematic analysis of (1) common risk alleles coming from published GWAS, (2) of protein protein interac tion (PPI) networks informed by (3) gene expression data with a defined molecular target involved in the inflammatory processes promoting CVD, myeloid related protein (MRP) 8. (4) Through analysis of integrated haplo type scores (iHS) and F ST values in HapMap phase 2 data, we investigated whether recent selection pressure acting upon inflammatory genes affected CVD susceptibility loci. Our findings provide significant evidence for a PPI network (P , 0.033), which connects inflammatory and cardiovascular sus ceptibility genes, and establish a genetic framework of inflammatory CVD. 41.59% of PPI genes are associated with immune functions. 28.3% of in tegrated genes can be linked to both, an inflammatory and cardiovascular disease phenotype. Interestingly, CDKN2B, and CELSR2 /PSRC1/MYBPHL/ SORT1, unequivocally replicated CVD loci, are integrated within this network as are several SNPs located in transcription factor recognition sequences, i.e. NFKB1, STAT3, which are key factors in inflammation. Finally, we observed a significant enrichment of inflammatory variants within CVD loci that are targets of selection (P,2.001e 11 in CEU population), suggesting that recent selective sweeps may have affected the genomic architecture underlying CVD.",2014
21192,"The development of new strategies based on next generation sequencing enables the large scale screening of genes involved in rare diseases. We have developed a custom design based on the HaloPlexÃ¢ÂÂ¢ technology (Agi lent Technologies) to sequence the coding regions of 163 candidate genes, including all genes previously linked to cardiac arrhythmias. In total, 570 individuals were included in this study. To validate our design, we first analysed 42 patients with inherited cardiac arrhythmias. Among the 69 genetic variants previously identified in these patients, 68 were detected automatically after HaloPlex library preparation and Illumina se quencing. The undetected variant is a substitution located in a low coverage region. Subsequently, 361 additional patients were analysed (178 patients with Brugada syndrome; 89 patients with early repolarization syndrome; 94 cases of progressive cardiac conduction defects). We also analysed 167 controls, over 65 years of age and showing no signs of cardiac rhythm or conduction abnormalities. The mean coverage was 577X and we found 5 rare functional variants per patient on average. Then, burden tests were performed to detect genes significantly associated to cardiac arrhythmias. This approach also identified potential new disease genes, and replication in an independent cohort is in progress. Our study will lead to a catalogue of mutations in genes linked to hereditary cases of sudden cardiac death. The systematic screening of our cohorts will also guide our future molecular investigations for these diseases and contri bute towards improving the prevention of sudden cardiac death.

21193,"The strength of next generation sequencing (NGS) in both research and dia gnostics is becoming increasingly evident. It can be successfully applied to find causal mutations and confirm the clinical diagnosis in genetic cardio myopathies. However, exome sequencing (ES) show incomplete representa tion and coverage of several exons, leading to clinically relevant mutations being missed. Therefore ES will, at least for now, coexist in clinical genetic diagnostics with other NGS based strategies, such as targeted resequencing. To this end, using an enrichment kit targeting 48 genes associated with he reditary cardiomyopathies and analysing 90+ patient samples, we demon strated that the sensitivity, specificity and robustness of targeted NGS are equal to those of Sanger Sequencing (SS). Subsequently, we constructed an improved kit targeting 55 genes and implemented this into routine dia gnostics. Using this kit, 700+ patients have been analysed, and additional haplotype and cosegregation analyses were performed to further support pathogenicity of potentially causal mutations. Our results show that: (1) our approach results in significant increase in diagnostic yield, as in up to 50% of patients (potentially) pathogenic mutations were identified; (2) critical evaluation of the clinical diagnoses showed that higher diagnostic yields are achieved for patients fulfilling the respective cardiomyopathy subtype crite ria; (3) TTN mutations account for a significant part of the yield; (4) in >10% of cases two or more (potentially) pathogenic mutations were identified; (5) further haplotype and cosegregation analyses support the pathogenicity of a significant number of potentially causal mutations.

21194,"Introduction: Cardiomyopathies (CMPs) are a group of severe, genetically heterogeneous heart disorders with more than 100 disease causing genes reported to date. By enabling comprehensive genetic screening, Next Gene ration Sequencing (NGS) is an appealing diagnostic approach for CMPs. In this study, we apply NGS to a cohort of genetically undiagnosed patients in order to identify the disease causing mutations and characterize the mole cular background of early onset CMP in Finland. By detecting robust geno type phenotype correlations, genetic data can be informative in prioritizing cases to cardiac transplantation. Materials and methods: Our cohort consists of 57 Finnish early onset CMP patients. The clinical presentation is diverse, ranging from heart speci fic muscle diseases to multiorgan syndromes. Nine of the patients were screened for mutations by whole exome sequencing (WES) and 48 by tar geted sequencing using a custom designed panel (HaloPlex) of 117 cardiac genes. Variants were prioritized in respect to frequency and pathogenicity prediction. The candidate mutations were further verified to match the di sease segregation in the family and to be absent in Finnish controls. Results: Mutations were confirmed in four of the WES investigated patients. Among these, screening of family members revealed de novo mutations in three sporadic severe cases. For the patients investigated with targeted se quencing, strong candidate mutations were identified in 14 cases. Conclusions: In the current stage of the study, WES has led to a genetic dia gnosis success rate of approximately 45%, while for targeted sequencing a success rate of 30% is expected. De novo mutations were found to cause CMPs in the early onset cohort under study.",2014

Mitochondrial DNA mutations are involved in development of cardiomyopathy through di sturbing oxidative energy metabolism. It has been shown that various types of cardiomyopathy can be attributed to disturbed mitochondrial oxidative energy metabolism. The goal of our study was to apply next generation se quencing (NGS) technology as a method to detect mtDNA mutations in pati ents with cardiomyopathy. Methods: 18 patients were included in this study. The entire mitochondri al DNA was amplified in two overlapping polymerase chain reaction (PCR) fragments from the Cardiac tissue of the patients undergoing cardiac surge ry. mtDNA was deep sequenced by NGS technology. Results: Six newborns and 12 infant patients with cardiomyopathy were studied using NGS technology and bioinformatics analysis of the sequence data allowed determination of new and reported variation for each indi vidual. Both known and unknown mutations were determined from 18 of patients. Eleven novel mtDNA mutations were identified at seven patients. Three of the patients have novel mutations together with reported cardio myopathy mutations. LHON, Cyclic Vomiting Syndrome with Migraine, Mul tiple Sclerosis, and Breast cancer risk associated mutations also observed at three patients. Discussion: In this report, we provide the results of mtDNA analysis for 18 patients with cardiomyopathy. All patients displayed at least one mtDNA mutation. Sixty mutations were found, and 13 of them were unreported. This study represents the most comprehensive mtDNA mutational analysis in congenital cardiac infant patients.",2014

The present work aimed to study copy number variants (CNVs) in the 22q11.2 region of 87 CHD patients from SÃÂ£o Miguel Island, Azores. The CNVs were searched in all patients using MLPA, according to MRC Holland protocol. Results showed that four (4.6%) out of 87 CHD patients presented CNVs, which were confirmed by aCGH in patients 1 and 2, and by FISH in patients 3 and 4. Patients 1 and 3, both affected with a ventricular septal defect, carried a de novo 2.5 Mb deletion of the 22q11.2 region, whe reas patient 2, with an atrial septal defect, carried a de novo 2.5 Mb micro duplication (2:1). Finally, patient 4 showed a 2.5 Mb triplication (3:1) and presented dysmorphic facial features, cognitive deficit, and aortic stenosis, a clinical feature not reported in the first case described in the literature. In terestingly, the evaluation of this patientÃ¢ÂÂs parents revealed that her non af fected father had a 2.5 Mb microduplication (2:1). Now we are investigating by microsatellite analysis the mechanisms responsible for microduplication and triplication. In summary, the present study allowed the identification of very rare dele tion and microduplication syndromes in Azorean CHD patients. Moreover, we report the second patient with a 22q11.2 triplication, whose clinical fea tures increase the symptoms that could be present.

In this study we investigated the frequency of 22q11 microdeletion among patients with congenital heart defect and clinical features of 22q11.2 deletion syndrome. The study population was 57 individuals who underwent detailed clinical evaluation including assessment of cardiac morphology, facial appearance, lymphocyte immunophenotyping, presence of cleft palate and hypocalce mia/hypoparathyroidism screening. All tested patients have had congeni tal heart defect. Fluorescence in situ hybridization and multiplex ligation dependent probe amplification analysis revealed 22q11.2 microdeletion in 42.1% of studied patients. Cardiac malformations observed in patients with 22q11.2 deletion were tetralogy of Fallot, pulmonary artery atresia, com mon arterial trunk, interrupted aortic arch, ventricular septal defect and mi tral stenosis. Echocardiography accompanied by contrast computed tomo graphy scan and magnetic resonance angiography revealed malposition of branch pulmonary arteries in two patients with 22q11.2 microdeletion.

21201,"Genome wide association studies (GWAS) usually point to genomic regions of interest in relation to a trait, but seldom directly identify the causal or functional variant. In a two stage GWAS [Salvi et al, Hypertension 2012, PMID: 22184326], we revealed the association between rs3918226 polymorphism in the promo ter of the endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) gene and hypertension (T allele, odds ratio 1.54; combined p , 2.58ÃÂ·10^ 13). We identified in silico a putative binding site for transcription factors of the ETS (E twenty six) family only one nucleotide away from rs3918226. We then confirmed our preliminary findings by target sequencing, in vitro experiments, and a population study [Salvi et al, Hypertension 2013, PMID: 24019403]. Target sequencing and imputing of the eNOS region validated rs3918226 as the polymorphism most closely associated with hypertension. HeLa and HEK293T cells transfected with the eNOS promoter carrying the risk T allele had 20% to 40% (P<0.01) lower transcriptional activity than those carrying the C allele (luciferase reporter assays). In a general popula tion of 2722 randomly recruited Europeans, TT homozygosity enhanced the age related increase in blood pressure and risk of hypertension. The preva lence of TT homozygosity is low but the attributable risk is 51.0%.Combined with other genetic markers, the rs3918226 polymorphism might, therefore, contribute to the stratification of cardiovascular risk.

21202,"Essential hypertension (EH) is a multifactorial disease with obscure etiolo gy and pathogenesis. Transcriptome of patients with EH is virtually unex plored. We performed the analysis of gene expression in peripheral blood leukocytes of patients with EH and healthy individuals using microarray technology (RT2ProfilerTM PCR Array, SABiosciences Corporation, Qiagen) with subsequent validation of the obtained results by quantitative real time RT PCR. We discovered a group of genes with altered transcriptional activity in hypertensive patients: CCL16, CCL17, CCL18, CCL19, CCL23, CCL8, CCR6, CCR8, CX3CR1, CXCL1, CXCL13, ICEBERG, IL17C, IL1F10, IL1F6, IL1F9, SPP1, CD40LG, XCR1, CCL2. Further quantitative analysis of genes with altered transcriptional activity was performed using cDNA samples of 32 EH patients and 31 control subjects. The results have confirmed significant differences of CCL18, CX3CR1, CXCL1, CXCL13, IL10, IL13, and CCR2 expres sion level between cases and controls (ÃÂ,0.001).

Functional analysis of differentially expressed genes was performed using Gene Ontology Biological Process and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Ge nomes databases. The genes with altered transcriptional activity in EH pa tients were found to encode for cytokines and cytokine receptors involved in immune response and inflammation, and their action was mediated via cytokine signaling pathway.

21204,"Background: Familial defective apolipoprotein B 100 (FDB) is a dominant inherited disorder most commonly caused by the substitution of glutamine to arginine at position 3527 in the ApoB 100 gene. The mutant p. Arg3527Glu causes a marked reduction in the affinity of low density lipoproteins (LDL) for the LDL receptor, which leads to hypercholesterolemia and increased risk for cardiovascular diseases (CVD). The p. Arg3527Glu mutation among Caucasian patients have a wide geographic and population distribution. Its prevalence varies among various European populations ranging from 0.08 % to 1.4 %. To our knowledge, this mutation has not yet been studied in the Slovenian population. Materials and Methods: Following clinical evaluation, p.

Nonetheless, the interrelation between RHR and cardiovascular diseases is not clear. In order to resolve this puzzle, the importance of genetic determinants of RHR has been recently suggested, but it needs to be further investigated. The aim of this study was to estimate the contribution of common genetic variations on RHR using Genome Wide Association Study. We performed a Genome Wide Association Study in an isolated population cohort of 1737 individuals, the Italian Network on Genetic Isolates Friuli Venezia Giulia (INGI FVG).

To better understand the molecular bases of HCM and to assess the utility of next generation sequencing (NGS) into clinical laboratory practice we designed a panel to analyze 17 HCM related genes on PGM Ion Torrent. We selected 70 HCM patients, 35 early onset (Ã¢ÂÂ¤35 years) and 35 late onset (Ã¢ÂÂ¥65 years), with a well defined hypertrophic phenotype. All samples had on average 98% of target regions with coverage higher than 20X, with a mean coverage of 600X. Common variants (MAF>5%) were removed from the analysis, while potential splice variants and novel single nucleotide variants were analysed with bioinformatics pathogenici ty prediction programs.

The mutation detection rate was 9/35 (26%) in the late onset and 29/35 (83%) in the early onset group (p<0.0001). Considering only early onset patients with positive family history the detection rate was >90%.Our results showed a strong difference in genetic background of HCM pati ents for age at onset, family history and clinical features of the disease. Ge netic testing with NGS was reliable and allowed the molecular diagnosis es pecially for cases with early onset and positive family history.

21208,"Congenital heart defects (CHD) is one of the most common congenital ab normalities in newborns, affecting almost 1% of the general population and is associated with substantial morbidity and mortality. A small subset (3%) of this patient population fails to correctly establish left right patterning du ring embryogenesis, resulting in abnormal lateralization of the abdominal and thoracic organs, a clinical phenotype called heterotaxy. As the heart is the first organ to develop asymmetrically, disturbances in the left right axis lead to a variety of serious cardiac malformations in heterotaxy. One of the first genes linked to heterotaxy was ZIC3, a zinc transcription factor of the GLI superfamily, located on the X chromosome. The ZIC3 gene is a transcrip tional regulator, based on the ability to activate transcription of target genes and to bind DNA. Over the last 10 years we collected and diagnostically tested over 300 pati ents referred to our clinical genetics center with heterotaxy and/or a variety of heart defects for mutations in the ZIC3 gene. We identified five potentially pathogenic mutations, as well as variations in the N terminal polyalanine repeat. The mutations were detected in families with a clear X linked clinical profile.

Cases and controls were genotyped together to avoid the batch effect for chips and time periods. The Log R ratio of the samples for each SNP was ob tained from Genome Studio and the Copy Number (CN) call was performed in Golden Helix after quality controls. CN was estimated in each sample as a mere signal intensity interval measured at a particular locus. Thorough quality control to refine the signal intensity was essential before CN call. Approximately 9% of the samples uniformly distributed between cases and controls were removed for signal to noise ratio and waviness. The PCA ana lysis on wave corrected data doesnÃ¢ÂÂt show demarcation on sex/phenotype, whereas the distinguishable genotyping batches were corrected. Among the 824 segments identified and discretized into 3 state CN, 13 segments were significantly associated with the phenotype.

Three variants were detected in MYO1C, JAG1, SYNE1 that have not been associated with CM, thus far. Only 12/17 identified genes are included in the currently available targeted TruSight assay. In 3/11 families the potential causative variant was found only in one gene. The combination of two to three pathogenic variants in CM associated genes were found in 8/11 families. Pathogenic potenti al of the identified variants must be substantiated by segregation and/or RNA/protein analyses. The failure to detect variants in two large families underscores the limitations of NGS. Nevertheless, our preliminary data sug gest, that the use of metabolome NGS in complex families may have higher diagnostic yield than targeted approaches in CM.

21211,"Mexicans have a higher prevalence of dyslipidemia than Europeans which causes a serious health problem due to the increased risk for cardiovascular disease. However, complex population substructure in this admixed popula tion leads to a decrease in statistical power hindering genetic research. Con sequently, Mexicans are substantially underrepresented in genomic studies despite their high susceptibility to dyslipidemias. We hypothesized that part of the increased predisposition is explained by population specific variants. To test our hypothesis, we performed a two stage cross population genome wide association study (GWAS) of hypertriglyceridemia using 19,273 sub jects of European and Mexican origin to screen for Mexican specific vari ants. First, we compared the Mexican population with its European ancestry population represented by Finns, utilizing Mexican low triglyceride (TG) controls and Finnish low TG controls to screen for variants that differ in fre quency between the two populations. Subsequently, we included only these variants in a Mexican TG case control GWAS to identify Mexican specific va riants. Four Mexican specific variants were discovered and replicated in an independent Mexican cohort (n,6,159), including signals near the lipoprote in lipase (LPL) and apolipoprotein A5 (APOA5) genes, suggesting that regu lation of the two key TG genes, APOA5 and LPL, play a crucial role in elevated TGs in Mexicans. We validated the cross population GWAS results with local ancestry analysis, and all replicated variants reside in highly Amerindian ancestry enriched regions in Mexicans with high TGs, indicating that cross population GWAS can effectively screen for population specific variants. In summary, we present a novel approach, cross population GWAS, which can be adapted for other admixed populations and different diseases.",2014
21212,"Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy (HCM) is characterized by left ventricular hypertrophy in the absence of a predisposing cardiovascular condition. Pa thogenic variants in 12 genes that encode proteins of the sarcomere have been implicated in HCM. Most of the pathogenic variants act in a dominant negative fashion. However loss of function (haploinsufficiency) is the most common disease mechanism for pathogenic variants in MYBPC3 suggesting that large deletions of the MYBPC3 gene may play a role in HCM pathogene sis. Here, we describe an individual affected with HCM who carries a deleti on of the entire MYBPC3 gene. The patient was diagnosed with non obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyo pathy in his mid forties when undergoing assessment for palpitations and hypertension. Echocardiogram revealed moderately dilated left and right atria with mild mitral regurgitation. There was severe asymmetric left ven tricular hypertrophy with interventricular septal hypertrophy. The left ven tricular systolic function was normal with an ejection fraction of 65 70%. MLPA analysis showed a deletion of all exons of the MYBPC3 gene. Subse quent microarray analysis confirmed this deletion and showed that it ex tended both 5Ã¢ÂÂ and 3Ã¢ÂÂ of MYBPC3 and included 3 additional known OMIM morbid genes (DDB2, SLC39A13 and RAPSN). Unlike MYBPC3, these addi tional genes are implicated in autosomal recessive disorders and therefore deletions of these genes are not expected to have clinical significance in this patient. Our results suggest that although large copy number variation of HCM rela ted genes would still be considered rare, patients highly suspected of HCM may benefit from MLPA analysis if other deleterious variants have not been identified.",2014
21213,"Background Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is considered the most common cause of sudden cardiac death (SCD) in young people. Over 18 ge nes have been associated with the disease. The aim of this study was to eva luate the clinical characteristics, penetrance and prognosis of HCM patients carrying a founder mutation in myosin binding protein C (MYBPC3) gene. Methods and Results Ninety seven HCM probands were screened for MYB PC3 mutations. The frameshift mutation c.912_913delTT (p. F305PfsX27) was found in 19 (19.5%) patients (14 males and 5 females). Among 81 re latives belonging to 14 apparently unrelated families, 45 (20 males and 25 females) resulted to be mutation carriers and 29 had HCM (17 males and 12 females). The family haplotype analysis confirmed a common founder ancestor. Disease penetrance was incomplete (64.4%) and greater in males than fe males (85% versus 48%, p,0.009). Eleven (38%) affected mutation carriers were diagnosed between 30 and 40 years old. Probands carrying this foun der mutation showed a worse prognosis for SCD or aborted SCD (p,0.01) compared with patients negative for MYBPC3 mutations. Conclusions The founder MYBPC3 mutation carriers have a high probabili ty to develop the disease between 30 and 40 years of age, with an increased risk if they are men. They show a significantly reduced survival after the fourth decade of life when compared to patients without MYBPC3 mutati ons. These findings are of relevant importance for the genetic counseling and therapy, considering the high frequency and poor prognosis associated with this founder mutation.",2014

Niguarda CaÃ¢ÂÂ Granda, Milan, Italy. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a common disorder of the heart characterized by cardiac hypertrophy of variable degree, myocyte disar ray and fibrosis and can cause severe disorders as angina, arrhythmias and heart failure. HCM affects approximately 1/500 subjects and is an autosomal dominant hereditary disease associated with mutations in genes encoding proteins of the contractile apparatus. As other inherited cardiomyopathies, HCM shows marked phenotypic variability, even within families. Mutati ons of MYH7 and MYBPC3 genes cover about 50% of cases. The MYH7 gene (14q11.2), encoding the heavy chain of ÃÂ² myosin protein, was the first gene whose mutations have been associated with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and is responsible for about 25% of all currently known pathogenic variati ons. The MYBPC3 gene (11p11.2) consists of 35 exons encoding the myosin binding protein C, whose cardiac isoform consists of 1274 amino acids. Here we report the data collected by our Unit since 2012. We tested 52 pa tients and found MYBPC3 causative mutations in 11 affected subjects (21% of cases); six mutations are already described in literature while five result novel ones.

21215,"At least 30 different genes have been linked to Hypertrophic Cardiomyopa thy (HCM), with MYBPC3 and MYH7 accounting for most of the mutations. Due to the large size of these genes, Sanger sequencing of single amplicons is labor intensive and expensive. Next generation sequencing (NGS) could facilitate the genetic screening of the HCM genes in large cohorts. Our pur pose was to designate and validate a procedure for sequencing the 9 most commonly mutated genes in HCM (MYH7, MYBPC3, TNNT2, TNNI3, ACTC1, TNNC1 , MYL2, MYL3, and TPM1), based on two tubes multiplex amplificati on of DNA pools (Ampliseq; 176 primer pairs covering 15,690 bp, 98,62% of the target coding sequence) followed by semiconductor array sequencing with the Ion Torrent Personal Genome Machine (PGM; Life Technologies). We created a pool with DNA from 13 patients previously Sanger sequenced for the coding exons plus at least 5 intronic flanking nucleotides of the nine genes. Each patient was heterozygous for a unique rare variant (including a small deletion); each unique allele (control variant) was thus diluted 1/26 inside the pool. We sequenced the DNA pool in a medium capacity Ion chip 316 (semiconductor 100 Mb) array, and the data was analyzed with the Torrent Suite software optimized to detect insertion/deletion nucleotide changes. We successfully identified all the 13 control variants (including the indels). In conclusion, we developed a NGS protocol for the main HCM genes. The multiplex amplification of DNA pools would reduce the time and cost of screening these genes at a population scale.",2014
21216,"Introduction: In approximately 5% 10% of the survivors of sudden cardiac death no underlying cardiac disease is identified and consequently the event is classified as idiopathic ventricular fibrillation (IVF). The genetic etiology of IVF remains mostly obscure and current consensus statements recom mend the genetic screening only in presence of clear clinical indications. Methods: Using whole exome sequencing (Illumina HiSeq 2000) we mole cularly investigated 2 Italian unrelated infants with IVF together with the unaffected parents and 3 affected members of a German family with history of sudden unexpected deaths below age 40. Results: In one infant (2 yo) we identified a de novo missense variant in RYR2, the main gene responsible for cathecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT). The avai lable clinical data were not sufficient to make the diagnosis, as the stress test, the leading clinical tool in CPVT diagnostic process, is not feasible in infancy. In the second infant (4 months), we detected a de novo missense variant in the PARN gene and the biological plausibility of this result is cur rently under investigation. In the German family we detected in all affected members a novel frameshift mutation in the desmoplakin gene, associated with ARVC with LV involvement (left dominant arrhythmogenic cardiomyo pathy, LDAC). As a matter of fact this finding allowed a better management and follow up of affected members. Conclusion: Our approach suggests that a target screening for channelopathy and cardiomyopathy genes could be indicated in those IVF cases in which a complete clinical and familial eva luation is not feasible.",2014

Here, we re port a new FBN1 mutation in an MFS family that had remained negative after extensive molecular genomic DNA FBN1 testing, including denaturing high performance liquid chromatography (DHPLC), Sanger sequencing, multiplex ligation dependent probe amplification (MLPA) and micro array analysis for copy number variation. In addition, four other aneurysm linked genes were screened for mutations by Sanger sequencing, TGFBR1, TGFBR2, SMAD3 and ACTA2, without any result. Linkage analysis in the family re vealed a large linked region on chromosome 15 which was confirmed by microsatellite analysis. Cultured proband fibroblasts and subsequent cDNA sequencing revealed a double peak pattern at the junction of exon 56 and 57. Sanger sequencing of intron 56 revealed a deep intronic point mutation generating a new splice donor site (c.6872 961A>G; ENST00000316623). Together with an existing cryptic splice acceptor site, this mutation results in the integration of a 90 bp pseudo exon between exons 56 and 57 contai ning a stop codon and causing nonsense mediated mRNA decay. Although more than 90% of FBN1 mutations can be identified with regular molecular testing at the genomic level, deep intronic mutations will be missed and re quire cDNA sequencing or whole genome sequencing.",2014

Here we report a family where the proband is compound heterozygous for two mutations in FBN1. CaseThe proband (II:1) was on suspicion of Marfan syndrome at 21 years of age. An aortic dilation was found at age 17, during clinical investigation for rheu matoid arthritis. Family history was ambiguous: His father was operated for an aortic aneurism at age 30, allegedly caused by endocarditis. Sequencing using an NGS panel for Marfan and Marfan like syndromes was undertaken. Two mutations were found in FBN1; one previously reported as causative for Marfan syndrome, the other novel. Results of family investigation and clinical findings are reported in table 1.InterpretationCompound heterozygousity has previously been reported in Marfan syndro me. Neither of the two mutations found are present in ESP , nor found among 2000 Danish exomes. In the present case we find it more likely that the pre viously reported supposed pathogenic mutation found in I:2 is of no/little phenotypical consequence.

21219,"The main strength of genetic isolated populations is the enrichment in low frequency variants in respect to the general population. To date they have been used in large meta analyses to highlight genetic association of common variants with several complex traits. Thanks to next generation sequencing approaches we are now able to map population specific low frequency variants. The Italian Network of Genetics Isolates (INGI) collects > 4,000 genotyped individuals from several isolated populations along Italy sampled for a large set of obesity and cardiovascular related traits. The whole Italian cohort has been imputed to UK10k sequenced reference set to highlight rare variants associations for ~ 30 traits in common that affect metabolism: several popu lation specific associated LOCI were enriched in rare variants, 33 suggestive LOCI were shared in 2 or more cohorts and most of UK10k outcomes were replicated by Italian cohorts. A first random subset of 110 Italian isolated individuals was sequenced by a low coverage approach: 39% were rare variants, 22% were private SNPs and 14% were population specific variants.

21220,"Understanding gene regulation in the cardiovascular system provides a source of potential cardiovascular disease (CVD) mediators and therapeutic targets. It may also give functional evidence for associations between gene tic variants and CVD. The link between inflammation and CVD is well esta blished and Acute Phase Proteins (APPs) of the innate immune system are recognized CVD markers. Changes in the expression of APPs are primarily due to altered hepatic expression in response to circulating inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin 6 (IL 6). Whereas cytokines are rapidly cle ared following induction of the Acute Phase Response (APR), the expressi on of APPs is maintained for several days and is diagnostically useful. Mi croRNAs (miRNAs) also show potential as CVD biomarkers since many are stable in the circulation and their expression is altered in acute myocardial infarction and cancer. To determine whether miRNAs are involved in modulating the expression of specific APPs in the APR, we performed RNAseq on small RNAs in HepG2 cells, and human and mouse primary hepatocytes stimulated with IL 6 for 0, 6 and 24h. Our data revealed 21 differentially expressed miRNAs upon IL 6 stimulation across all samples (10 up regulated, 11 down regulated), 13 of which are known circulating miRNAs. Interestingly, although no dif ferentially expressed miRNAs were shared between the three hepatic cell types, groups of functionally related target genes (SOCS, ADAMTS, MMP , in terleukins) are common to all three and are involved in cytokine signaling, coagulation, hypoxia and angiogenesis. Identifying new APR markers may provide important diagnostic tools and enhance our understanding of this complex system.",2014
21221,"Microcephaly with or without chorioretinopathy, lymphedema, or mental retardation syndrome (MCLMR, OMIM 152950) is a rare autosomal domi nant disorder with variable expressivity. It is characterized by mild to seve re microcephaly, often associated with developmental delay, ocular defects and lymphedema, usually on the dorsum of the feet. It can be sporadic or inherited. So far, 25 families (46 patients) have been described to carry a mutation in KIF11. This gene encodes a homotetrameric motor kinesin, EG5. Members of this protein family are involved in the establishment of a bipo lar spindle during cell mitosis, in chromosome positioning and in centro some separation. EG5 inhibition impairs endothelial cell proliferation and migration, and angiogenesis. We tested a series of 23 unreported MCLMR index patients for KIF11 and found 14 mutations, 12 of which are novel. We detected a mutation in all 7 familial cases and 7 of the 16 sporadic pati ents. The inherited mutations were found in an additional 12 family mem bers. We subsequently reviewed the clinical phenotypes of all the patients with a KIF11 mutation, including those already published (n,46+26,72).

Mutations in NOTCH1 are associated with LVOTO, but since its discove ry in 2006 only eight new NOTCH1 mutations have been identified, mostly in sporadic LVOTO patients. Patients and methods: In 427 LVOTO probands (204 BAV/AVS, 135 COA, 75 HLHS, 13 other) NOTCH1 mutation analysis was performed. Also family members of probands with NOTCH1 mutations were screened for the mutation. We report on the clinical characteristics and natural history of NOTCH1 mutation carriers. Results: Thirteen patho genic NOTCH1 mutations were detected in 427 (3%) LVOTO probands (8% of familial cases and 1% of sporadic cases). In total 52 NOTCH1 (obligate) mutation carriers were identified. The phenotype included not only LVO TO, but a wide variety of cardiovascular malformations (CVM) including conotruncal heart malformations (12%), septal defects (8%), and thoracic aortic aneurysms (8%). The disease seems highly penetrant at adult age. Conclusion: NOTCH1 mutations are present in 8% of familial LVOTO. The phenotypic spectrum is expanded and includes a wide variety of heart mal formations, indicating an effect of these mutations on neural crest derived cells and epithelial to mesenchymal transition. The high penetrance at adult age highlights the importance of genetic testing of NOTCH1 for early diagno sis, not only in LVOTO families but in a variety of familial congenital CVM.",2014

Hundreds of mutations in coding exons and introns of, at least, seven genes have been reported to associate with idiopathic and familial forms of PAH. Comprehensive genetic testing can improve diagnostics, prognostics and treatment optimization of the index patient but it also allows effective scree ning of asymptomatic family members, which is a basis for well informed genetic counseling. Methods: We adopted the novel oligonucleotide selecti ve sequencing (OS Seq) and developed a custom data analysis and interpre tation pipeline to identify pathogenic base substitutions and insertions and deletions in seven genes associated with PAH: BMPR2, BMPR1B, ACVRL1, ENG, SMAD9, CAV1 and KCNK3. Our sequencing panels covered >99% of the targeted regions with >15x coverage. We validated our diagnostic pa nels using reference HapMap samples with known genomes and mutations. Results: The sensitivity of OS Seq to detect base substitutions was >99% and specificity was >99.9%. The accuracy to detect short INDELs was 100%. We then analyzed 22 iPAH patient samples to identify known and novel va riants potentially associating with the disease. We confirmed all candidate variants using direct sequencing. The utilized novel technology allows si gnificant cost reduction and rapid turnaround time from sample to clinical interpretation.

Introduction: Noonan Syndrome Multiple Lentigines ( NS ML) is a rare au tosomal dominant disorder, and one of the conditions known as RASopa thies. PTPN11, RAF1, and BRAF are the genes known to be associated with NS ML. Sequence analysis of coding exons 7, 12, and 13 of PTPN11 detects missense mutations in about 90% of individuals tested. Objective: The aim of this study was to characterize the clinical and molecu lar features of Chilean patients with NS ML. Methods: collaborative and de scriptive study. Results: thirteen patients have been confirmed molecularly. This includes two familial cases. The age at diagnosis ranged from 20 days to 33 years old. In six patients including one of the family cases, the recurrent mutation p. Tyr279Cys in exon 7 was identified. They showed interfamilial and intrafamiliar variable expressivity. Four patients have mutations in exon 12, three with the recurrent mutation p. Thr468Met and one with an infre cuently reported one, p. Ala461Thr. Two different mutations were identified in exon 13, in three patients. The uncommon mutation p. Gln510Glu, was found in two patients, both with prenatal cardiac manifestations, and a Hy pertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) rapidly progressive. The other mutation at codon 510 is a Gln510Pro. Discussion: The diagnosis of this condition may be challenging because clinical features overlap with other RASopa thies. Although NS ML seems to be rare, we have diagnosed a considerable number of patients. We developed a high index of suspicion particularly in patients with HCM.

21228,"Background: Sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) is currently the major cause of an unexpected and unexplained death of infants in the first year of lifetime in industrialized countries. Besides environmental factors also ge netic factors are supposed as risk factors for SIDS. Notably, a frameshift mu tation (c.457dupG, p. Glu153Glyfs*17) in the TSPYL1 gene has been reported as disease causing for an autosomal recessive sudden infant death with dys genesis of the testes syndrome (SIDDT) in an Old Order Amish community in Pennsylvania. Because the Amish community was originally founded in the German speaking part of Switzerland, including people from Alsace and Palatinate, a mutation analysis of the entire TSPYL1 gene was performed in a cohort of 166 SIDS cases originating from the Swiss population around Zurich in comparison to 163 controls. Eight known SNP variants (rs61746509, rs3828743, rs3749895, rs61746508, rs56100880, rs3749894, rs45490498 and rs9400897) were detected in the analyzed SIDS cohort, none of which was significantly as sociated with SIDS. In this context we also found two potentially disease causing amino acid substitutions in three deceased girls. One SIDS affected girl was heterozygous for the novel TSPYL1 variant c.106C>G (p.

Results: Molecular testing confirmed that the proband and his cou sin were heterozygous carriers of a deletion of exons 4 12 in SMAD3 . Each had several features typically seen in Marfan syndrome or Loeys Dietz syn drome (marfanoid habitus, ocular hypertelorism in one case and mild mar fanoid craniofacial features and excessive striae in the other).

Eight more mutation carriers were identified. Of the adults 39 years or older who carried the mutation, all 5 had multiple punctate palmar keratoses. For the 5 carriers aged 13 22 years, one had definite palmar kera toses. None of the mutation negative patients had palmar keratoses. There was considerable variability in age at onset for aneurysm/dissection and presence of non vascular features. A summary of features will be presented. Conclusions: We conclude that punctate palmar keratoses may be a pre viously unreported feature of some families with SMAD3 related aortic an eurysms and dissections, and a useful sign in distinguishing SMAD3 related cases from other genes associated with aortic aneurysm/dissection.",2014
21230,"ALOX5AP (5 lipoxygenase) has been recognized as a susceptibility gene for stroke. Using a case control design, we sequenced the whole coding and ad joining intronic regions of ALOX5AP to study the role of SNPs and their inter play with other risk factors in Greek patients with stroke. 277 patients were included and classified by the Trial of Org 10172 in Acute Stroke Treatment (TOAST): large vessel disease (63), intracerebral hemorrhage (33), car dioembolic origin (14), undetermined (38), other causes (12) and lacunes (117). The mean age of patients was 58.9ÃÂ±14.64, comprising 191 males. A control group of 210 subjects, ethnicity, sex and age matched, with no stro ke history were also genotyped. Risk factors (hyperlipidemia, hypertension, atrial fibrillation, migraine, CAD, diabetes, smoking and alcohol consumpti on) were assessed as confounding factors. SNPs rs4769055, rs3803277 and rs202068154 showed significantly different (p<0.01) frequencies between patients and controls. More specifically the genotype frequencies of AA (mi nor allele) of rs4769055, of genotype CA (A minor allele) of rs3803277 and of AC genotype (C minor allele) of rs202068154 were significantly higher (p<0.01) in controls than in patients. All the above SNPs are located in intro nic regions of the gene and according to in silico programs EX_SKIP and HSF they affect splicing of exons 1 and 2 of ALOX5AP . The results were indicative of a protective role of the three SNPs either in homozygosity or heterozy gosity for MAF. However, confounding factors as mentioned above have a strong impact on stroke occurrence and outweighed the protective role of the above SNPs.",2014
21231,"The incidence of sudden cardiac death (SCD) increases with age in parallel with coronaryÃ¢ÂÂs diseasesÃ¢ÂÂ prevalence. In young persons and athletes, SCD occurs in half of the cases, in the setting of genetically transmitted disorders such as cardiomyopathies. Molecular testing performed after necropsy may help management of families but experience in this area appears very limi ted. The aim is to report our experience of post mortem molecular testing after SCD and necropsy. We studied 36 patients <40 years who died sud denly with a suspected diagnosis of cardiomyopathy, established either after autopsy or known before death , with 6 dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), 12 hypertrophic (HCM), 2 HCM/DCM , 1 restrictive (CMR), 14 arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC), 1 HMC and left ventricular non compaction. Fifteen mutations have been identified in sarcomeric or desmo somal or lamin genes. The identification of these mutations had significant impact: assessing right diagnosis in a doubtful case (HCM without LVH), modifying the appropriate diagnosis in another case (HCM and not DCM), providing guidance for genetic counselling and predictive genetic testing in relatives in all situations. Technical, ethical and legal issues may however be encountered and will be discussed. This study is one of the first series of post mortem molecular testing after SCD which suggests the feasibility, efficiency and the benefit of the approach to improve the management of families. Postmortem molecular testing must take its place in the strategy of family care after SCD, even if a cardiomyopathy is suspected at necropsy, since genetic findings provide additional information.",2014

21233,"Vascular Ehlers Danlos Syndrome (vEDS) is a severe, life threatening he ritable connective tissue disorder, characterized by translucent skin, easy bruising, and propensity to rupture of arteries and hollow organs. The mole cular basis of vEDS has been well studied, showing a wide range of muta tions in COL3A1, encoding type III procollagen. Most mutations result in a glycine substitutions, pivotal for correct folding of the triple helical domain. The mechanisms by which mutant type III collagen cause vascular fragili ty are not well understood, but factors, other than mechanical failure, are believed to contribute to the phenotype. A Col3a1 knock out mouse model shows early lethality and is therefore not suitable for functional studies. We generated a transgenic vEDS mouse model with a Col3a1 missense mu tation. With a BAC transgenic approach, the Col3a1 c.547G>A (p. Gly183Ser) mutation, a typical helical glycine substitution, was introduced into the C57BL/6 mouse genome. Spontaneous development of open skin wounds was observed in all transgenic males, but not in females. Expression analysis on dermal fibroblasts revealed substantial higher expression of type III col lagen in transgenic males compared to transgenic females. Biomechanical testing of both transgenic males and females showed significantly reduced tensile strength of the skin, aorta and colon. Transmission electron micro scopy of skin and aortic tissues showed severely abnormal collagen fibrils, intracellular spaces between smooth muscle cells and dilation of the endo plasmic reticulum (ER) , indicating excessive protein load and ER stress. This novel animal model provides new opportunities for in depth analyses of the pathogenic basis of vEDS and for possible therapeutic interventions.",2014
21234,"Vascular anomalies are a heterogeneous group of congenital malformations of the circulatory system characterized by morpho structural and/or func tional defects of various nature, severity and extent in any type of vessel (ar teries, capillaries, veins and lymphatic vessels) and in any part of the body. Although most vascular malformations are sporadic (simple or combined), syndromic and familial forms also exist. Diagnosis may be complicated even for experienced specialists, because there is substantial clinical overlap bet ween lesions and each can mimic the others. To our knowledge, there are currently 15 known genetic forms of Mendelian vascular malformation and mutations with autosomal recessive, autosomal dominant or paradominant inheritance have been identified in 25 genes. Sporadic cases with de novo mutations in causative genes of familial forms have also been described. In this study, we investigated all 25 known genes in 108 patients with sporadic congenital vascular anomalies by next generation sequencing. We identified 24 variations (22%). To estimate their pathogenicity, each variation was looked up in dbSNP137, its frequency was compared using data from the Exome Variant Server, the effect of amino acid substitution on the protein was evaluated using in silico analysis, and where possible, it was investigated in the family. Our results confirm the utility and efficacy of genetic testing, even in sporadic cases. Identification of causative genes will be decisive for: determining genotype phenotype relationships; determining transmission risk; organizing personalized follow ups; characterizing new drug targets for experimental gene specific therapies.",2014
21235,"Hypertension, diabetes and hypercholesterolemia are risk factors for the development of cardiovascular disease, one of the leading causes of death in the world. There are few data on the influence of genetic polymorphisms in these diseases. The guanine nucleotide exchange factors VAV2 and VAV3 play an important role in vascular homeostasis in vivo. Therefore, we evalu ated the association of VAV2 (rs 602990) and VAV3 (rs7528153) polymor phisms with susceptibility to hypertension and diabetes induced cardiova scular risk and cardiovascular damage. We extracted DNA from peripheral blood of 384 patients (152 hypertensive, 66 diabetic and 166 non diabetic non hypertensive). Polymorphisms were detected by qPCR with TaqMan ÃÂ® probes. We analyzed systolic, diastolic and pulse blood pressure, basal gly caemia, endothelial dysfunction (by measurement of pulse wave velocity), retinopathy, left ventricular hypertrophy and cardiovascular risk. VAV2 Val584Met polymorphism is associated with family history of hyperchole sterolemia in non hypertensive patients carrying the TT genotype (p,0.034, OR,2.706, 1.205 6.321) and the CT genotype (p,0.034, OR,2.194, 1.059 4.545), with elevated pulse pressure in smoker patients carriers of the TT allele (p,0.016, OR,5.538, 1.022 30.019) and with reduced risk of develo ping metabolic syndrome in non smokers patients carriers of the TT allele (p,0.05, OR,0,408, 0.180 0.927). VAV3 Sher298Thr heterozygous polymor phism is associated with patients with lower incidence of family history of diabetes (p,0.018, OR,0.470, 0.279 0.793) and with increased fasting glu cose in non smoking non diabetic patients carrying the TT allele (p,0.043, OR,3.700, 1.266 10.815).

An insufficient dose may fail to prevent thrombo embolism, while an overdose increases the risk of bleeding. Patients with CYP2C9*2 and/or CYP2C9*3 polymorphisms need lower dose than wild type patients. VKORC1 (vitamin K epoxide reductase complex 1) is another gene affecting warfarin metabolism. VKORC1 variants have been reported to be associated with a need for lower doses of warfarin compared with wild type variants during long term therapy. Objective: This study was conducted to identify the associations between demographic characteristics (sex, height, weight, age, ethnicity), and gene tic polymorphisms of CYP2C9 and VKORC1 ( 1639G>A) with warfarin dose among Iranian patients. Materials and Methods: Our study concluded 200 patients that reached to a stable dose of warfarin.

Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH; OMIM 178600) is a progressive va scular disorder characterized by pulmonary vascular resistance increase, vascular remodelling and right heart failure. Angiotensin II is both a potent vasopressor hormone and a primary regulator of aldosterone secretion. It is an important factor that controls blood pressure and volume in the cardio vascular system. AGTR1 gene plays an integral role in blood pressure con trol, and is involved in the pathogenesis of hypertension. In this study, we demonstrated the association between c.1166A>C polymorphism and PAH. We included 55 PAH patients and 52 controls. Using specifically designed primers we amplified and sequenced the 3ÃÂ´ untraslated region of AGTR1. We analyzed the c.1166A>C polymorphism located on 3ÃÂ´UTR of AGTR1 gene. By comparing genotype frequencies of controls and patients with PAH, we obtained statistically significant differences for this SNP between the two groups (p>0.001). The RR of developing PAH in patients with this SNP is 20.3; IC 95%; p<0.001. The statistical analysis of clinical and hemodyna mics parameters between patients with or without this SNP showed signi ficant differences in systolic pulmonary pressure (p,0.037), cardiac index (p,0.012) and PAH subtypes (IPAH vs APAH) (p,0.028). This SNP is present in 72.4% of IPAH patients and in 67.8% of APAH patients, producing a more severe phenotype. This SNP only appears in 25% of control cohort. In conclusion, this polymorphism in AGTR1 gene is more frequent in IPAH than in APAH patients and predispose individuals to an increased risk of developing PAH associated with a more severe phenotype.",2014

Alkaptonuria (AKU, Ã¢ÂÂblack bone diseaseÃ¢ÂÂ) is caused by mutations in homo gentisate 1,2 dioxygenase (HGD) gene leading to deficiency of HGD enzyme activity. Clinically it leads mainly to homogentisic aciduria, ochronosis and painful and disabling ochronotic arthritis. AKU was described by Sir Archi bald Garrod as the first inborn error of metabolism in 1902, and now, more than 110 years later, we test nitisinone as the first possible treatment of this disorder. We analysed for HGD mutations 40 AKU patients enrolled for the first part of this 7FP supported project DevelopAKUre run in two stu dy centres in Piestany (Slovakia) and Liverpool (UK). In this cohort we ob served 20 different pathogenic variants, two of which were novel. The first mutation (R53Q c.158G>A) was present in homozygous state in one patient of Indian origin. The second one (T167I,c.500C>T) was identified in one copy in Slovak AKU patient, further confirming the genetic heterogeneity of AKU in this small country with increased incidence of AKU, where now already 13 mutations are reported. Eight additional novel HGD mutations were found in AKU patients sent to our laboratory for a routine molecu lar diagnostics within a frame of different collaborations. The novel R53Q mutation identified in DevelopAKUre was found also in one Italian patient.

The X linked infantile onset Barth syndrome (BTHS; OMIM #302060) is caused by mutations in the TAZ gene and generally manifests in hemizygous males. The major clinical manifestations are cardiomyopathy with or wit hout left ventricular noncompaction, skeletal myopathy, hypotonia, grow th delay and neutropenia. Confirmatory tests are provided by mutational analysis of the TAZ gene and/or the biochemical dosage of the monolyso cardiolipin/ tetralinoleoyl cardiolipin ratio. Heterozygous females do not normally manifest clinically but may undergo molecular prenatal diagnosis during pregnancy. Here we report the unusual case of a family in whom the male proband and his mother carry different TAZ mutations. The ten year old proband harbou red a novel g.4552364_4562302del9937ins705 complex rearrangement which serves to remove TAZ exons 1 5. However, during a subsequent ma ternal pregnancy, molecular prenatal diagnosis of the male fetus revealed that he carried a different TAZ gene lesion, g.4558047_4558278del232. The mother was subsequently confirmed to be heterozygous for this novel g.4558047_4558278del232 deletion (which removes only TAZ exon 1) but negative for the g.4552364_4562302del9937ins705. The g.4552364_4562302del9937ins705 mutation must therefore have occur red de novo in the male proband. The g.4558047_4558278del232 must have occurred de novo in the mother since it was not detected in either her mo ther or grandmother. Sequencing of the breakpoint junctions revealed mi crohomologies which could have prompted both rearrangements by serial replication slippage.

Boucher Neuhauser syndrome (BNS) is a rare genetic entity belonging to the group of hereditary cerebellar ataxias with hypogonadism. The com bination of chorioretinal dystrophy, hypogonadotropic hypogonadism and progressive spinocerebellar ataxia are the hallmarks of the disease. Here we report a new phospholipid disorder in a Brazilian BNS family caused by mutations in the PNPLA6 gene (Patatin like phospholipase domain con ABSTRACTS POSTERS ESHG 2014 | MILAN, ITALY | WWW.

Biochemical and molecular investigations were undertook in a Brazilian kindred affected by a complex neurological disorder, presenting mainly as a spinocerebellar ataxia with hypogonadism and early vision loss. After molecular analysis of genes associated with spinocerebellar ataxia and exclusion of other in born errors of metabolism (IEMs) associated with cerebellar disease, whole exome sequencing (WES) was performed. Mutations in the PNPLA6 gene were identified in all affected patients. They presented with very early on set visual loss (chorioretinal dystrophy) accompanied by progressive ce rebellar ataxia and primary hypogonadism. Brain MRI showed cerebellar and pons atrophy. Peripheral neuropathy (motor axonal neuropathy) was identified in all of them. Mutant mice with mutations in PNPLA6 gene have shown a relentless neurological disease. PNPLA6 codifies a neuropathy tar get esterase (NTE) hydrolase, an integral membrane protein located on the endoplasmic reticulum.

21242,"Genome wide association studies (GWAS) have identified hundreds of loci associated with cardiometabolic phenotypes, many of which overlap or lie in close proximity. Variants associated with multiple phenotypes, such as at IRS1 , can provide insight into biology of correlated cardiometabolic traits. However, the genetic architecture of these loci is frequently complex and needs further investigation. To disentangle association patterns of 630 as sociated SNPs (Dec 2012) from GWAS meta analyses in Europeans for 19 quantitative phenotypes and two cardiometabolic diseases, we defined sets of adjacent variants located less than 500kb apart and harboring 446 asso ciated SNPs within 151 genomic regions (range,2 8 SNPs/region). We ex amined, whether associations with multiple phenotypes within each region could be explained by LD through approximate conditional analysis (ApCA) using the GCTA tool. Across the 151 regions, we observed 14 (10%) loci in which the same SNP was associated with multiple phenotypes. Associations in 11 of these 14 loci were with epidemiologically highly correlated traits. Through ApCA, we identified 41 (27%) regions with multiple associated variants that under lie the same association signals, thus suggesting multi phenotype effects. Within 45 (30%) regions, multiple signals were explained by independent variants. Thirty two (21%) regions showed complex architecture, and for the remaining 19 (13%), the association with one phenotype partially ex plained the effect on another. Overall, a substantial number (87 or 57.62%) of cardiometabolic loci shows potential pleiotropic effects on multiple phenotypes, which might contribute to their shared biology. Within other regions, distinct genetic effects or more complex architecture could underlie independent regulatory mechanisms.",2014

The classical presentation is that of fai lure to thrive, abnormal fat distribution, and inverted nipples, with deve lopmental delay, seizures and ataxia. Other systemic features can include protein losing enteropathy, hepatomegaly, cardiomyopathy, renal cysts, and coagulopathy. Aside from coagulopathy, there are few case reports of hema tologic abnormalities in CDG1a. We report a three and a half year old girl with CDG1a diagnosed at 4 months of age.

To date almost all reported patients were from East Asia and only few cases from Caucasian origin have been described. We report the first Bulgarian case of NICCD a male infant with a mild neo natal jaundice which resolved spontaneously. The patient became jaundice again at 40 days old. Initial investigations revealed conjugated hyperbilirubinemia and evidence of liver dysfunction, hypoproteinemia, mild hypoglycemia and mild anemia. Metabolic evaluation showed lactate acidemia, galactosemia and significant elevation of citrulline, methionine and arginine. Mutation study of the SLC25A13 gene showed the compound heterozygo te, c.1081C>T (p. R361X) and c.74C>A (p. A25E), which confirmed the dia gnosis of NICCD. c.1081C>T (p.

After galactose restriction and supplementation with fat soluble vitamins liver functions were normalized and cath up growth was achieved before 8 months of age. In conclusion, we presented a new genetically confirmed case of NICCD pati ent from non Asian origin. We detected a previously undescribed nonsense mutation in SLC25A13 which further expanded the genotypic spectrum and genotype phenotype correlations of citrin deficiency.

To evaluate the assay, targeted sequencing was performed for 16 CDG type I and 15 CDG type II patients. The mean coverage in the target region was about 600x and a genotype was called for more than 97% of the targeted bases. A diagnosis was confirmed in 8 cases. Interestingly, mutations could also be detected (and confirmed) in the gene ALG1 that could not be assayed by genomic Sanger sequencing due to the abundance of pseudogenes. After our targeted assay enabled an increased diagnostic yield, the the most interesting, unsolved cases will be subjected to exome sequencing for gene discovery.",2014
21248,"Congenital disorders of glycosylation type I (CDG1) are inherited metabolic diseases with an extremely broad spectrum of clinical presentations caused by defective glycosylation of glycoproteins and glycolipids. Recently, muta tions in the SRD5A3 gene was found in patients with cerebellar ataxia, and eye malformations. Serum transferrin isoelectric focusing (IEF) demonstra ted a type 1 glycosylation defect, thus this disorder was classified as CDG1q. We present here a 4 month old male with coarse face, hypertrichosis and developmental delay. The baby was the fourth child of first cousin parents. He had narrow forehead, depressed nasal bridge, proptotic eyes, large fon tanelle (6x8cm), long philtrum, thin lips, loose skin, hepatosplenomegaly and bilateral inguinal hernia. He also had iris coloboma, glaucoma, nystag mus, corneal clouding and elevated serum transaminases. He was followed up until 27 months of age. He had severe hypotonia and no head control at this age. Dark pigmentation of dorsum of feet was developed. His cranial MR imaging revealed cerebellar hypoplasia, enlargement of lateral ventricules and frontal atrophy. Serum transferring IEF showed a type 1 pattern. Se rum IGF1 and antithrombin level also were decreased. Using homozygosity mapping followed by whole exome genotyping, we described a homozygous missense mutation (c.320G>A; p. Trp107X) in the SRD5A3 gene in the pati ent.

21249,"Congenital Hyperinsulinism of Infancy (CHI) is a rare disorder, characteri zed by heterogeneity in clinical and genetic features. An inappropriate in sulin secretion is responsible of hypoglycaemia, which can result in serious neurological damage and life long handicap. The genetic causes of CHI have been found in genes regulating insulin secretion from pancreatic beta cells but in about 50 % of CHI patients the molecular defect remain unknown. Hunting for novel CHI causing genes we performed whole exome sequen cing (WES) on 10 CHI patients [Proverbio MC et al, 2013; doi:10.1371/jour nal.pone.0068740]. To pinpoint the causal mutation in a small number of samples and to select the most promising candidate genes, we implemented a computational strategy including: 1) a bionformatics pipeline to identify a high quality single nucleotide variants (SNV); 2) an exome homozygo sity mapping using a novel algorithm H3M2 [Pippucci T el al, 2011; doi: 10.1159/000330164] and 3) a prioritization analysis using the list of rare and novel coding variants by mean of web tools such as ToppGene suite, Endeavour and Gene Distiller. Our approach resulted in a selection of small number of genes that significantly correlate with human phenotype and molecular pathways associated to congenital hyperinsulinism and insulin signalling. Among them we selected missense mutations affecting CDKAL1 and PIK3R1 for further investigations either at the level of protein structure (in silico protein modelling) and in respect to their role in beta cell using INS1 E cellular model and human pancreatic islets.",2014
21250,"Congenital hypothyroidism (CH) is the most common endocrine disorder among newborns but its genetic aetiology is still largely unknown, with ge netic defects identified in less than 20% of the cases. Mutations in genes for thyroid hormone synthesis (TG, TPO, DUOX2, IYD, SLC5A5, SLC26A4) have been implicated in dyshormonogenesis, while defects in thyroid transcripti on factors (PAX8, Nkx2.1, Nkx2.5 and FOXE1) and in the TSH receptor have been linked to thyroid dysgenesis. To identify novel mutations in CH, 42 pati ents and 21 unaffected relatives (25 families) were whole exome sequenced (WES) as part of the UK10K project. A further 29 patients and 10 unaffected relatives (24 families) were sequenced across a customized panel of genes. We searched for functional de novo or inherited variants that were rare in affected individuals, using 1000 Genomes, NHLBI ESP and UK10K as control datasets. A total of 15 mutations in known causative genes were identified in 10 dyshormonogenesis families. Ten of these variants were novel and pre dicted to be damaging (TG: 509X, C707Y, W1031L, C1474Y, W2666L, 140X, Q1625E, T1397RfsX30, G638+5; DUOX2: Q570L) and the remaining five were previously reported in CH cases (TG: R277X; DUOX2: Q686X, R354W; TPO: R665Q, R491H).Our initial findings highlight the potential of WES as a diagnostic tool: five ABSTRACTS POSTERS ESHG 2014 | MILAN, ITALY | WWW.

Danon disease (DD) is a X chromosome linked disorder that manifests by cognitive deficit, myopathy and cardiomyopathy in males. The phenotype in females is variable and mitigated as a likely consequence of tissue specific X chromosome inactivation (XCI) ratios. DD is caused by mutations in the lysosomal associated membrane protein 2 (LAMP2 ) gene. Majority of the mutations abolish the protein expression due to truncation of LAMP2 open reading frame. 10 15% of the mutations are exon copy number variations (eCNV) stemming primarily from recombination events in LAMP2 intron 3. DD laboratory testing relies on identification of the absence of the protein and characterization of the mutation within the LAMP2 gene. Importantly, the diagnostic protocol must reflect the following: (i) gender of the proband/patient, (ii) expression patterns of LAMP2 protein, (iii) alternative splicing of LAMP2 pre mRNA, (iii) mosaic LAMP2 expression determined by XCI in female patients, (iv) germinal/somatic mosaicism phenomena. LAMP2 protein testing should be performed by flow cytometry in peripheral white blood cells as this approach offers both minimal invasiveness and detection sensitivity down to 0.008% of deficient granulocytes. The latter is of criti cal importance in samples from suspect XCI mosaic female patients and/or family members who are potentially germinal/somatic mosaics. Molecular genetics methods should universally assess full length LAMP2 mRNA iso forms (2B, A and C) and consequently compare the abnormal findings to gDNA changes. This integrative approach has major advantages in genetic setups when qualitative PCR based methods failed to identify the mutation. Model examples of such situations will be provided in families affected by LAMP2 eCNVs.",2014
21252,"Disorders of postsqualene cholesterol biosynthesis (DCB) are a group of inborn errors of metabolism characterized by multiple congenital abnor malities, including significant skeletal involvement. The most frequent and best characterized example is the Smith Lemli Opitz syndrome (SLOS). Nine other disorders are known to date, namely autosomal recessive Antley Bix ler syndrome, Greenberg dysplasia, X linked dominant chondrodysplasia punctata, X linked recessive male emopamil binding protein (EBP) defici ency, congenital hemidysplasia with ichthyosiform erythroderma and limb defects (CHILD) syndrome, CK syndrome, SC4MOL deficiency and the SLOS like desmosterolosis and lathosterolosis. This study provides an overview of the skeletal radiology of DCB: we report the radiological features of 14 previously unreported patients and review the literature. Our study shows that the DCB have a common pattern of limb abnormalities including poly dactyly, which is typically postaxial and rarely interdigital and can involve all four limbs, and syndactyly of the toes. Chondrodysplasia punctata (CDP) is specifically associated with a subgroup of DCB (Greenberg dysplasia, CHILD syndrome, X linked dominant chondrodysplasia punctata, male EBP deficiency); the possible occurrence of epiphyseal stippling in SLOS, initi ally reported, does not appear to be confirmed. CDP is also associated with other congenital disorders such as chromosomal abnormalities, brachytele phalangic CDP (X linked recessive CDP , disruption of vitamin K metabolism, maternal autoimmune diseases), peroxisomal disorders (rhizomelic CDP) and lysosomal storage disorders. In the differential diagnosis of epiphyseal stippling, a moth eaten appearance of bones, asymmetry or the presence of the common pattern of limb abnormalities are further indicators of DCB.

21254,"Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is one of the most common single gene disorder mostly inherited as autosomal dominant trait. The physical sign of FH is elevated low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL C), elevated total cholesterol (TC) levels and tendon xantomas. Identification and early treat ment of affected individuals is desirable and in lack of physical symptoms DNA based diagnosis provides confirmations of diagnosis and enables early patient management. Majority of FH cases are caused by mutations in four genes (APOB, LAD LR, PCSK9 and LDLRAP1). There are commercial kits available for testing of most common FH causing mutations, but the spectrum of disease causing mutations is quite diverse in various populations. Here we report mutations found in 64 patients with suspected FH in a samp le from the Genome Database of Latvian population. We used targeted next generation sequencing approach in order to determine the full spectrum of mutations in coding regions of LDLR, APOB, PCSK9 and LDLRAP1. In total we found 28 missense one nucleotide mutations from which two rs5742904 (Arg3527Gln) in APOB gene and rs147509697 (Gly20Arg) in LDLR gene has been previously described as FH causing mutation confirming the FH in three patients (4.6 %). Possible FH causing mutations however were identi fied in majority of patients. Conclusion: most commonly employed commercial mutation panel is not sufficient for diagnosis of FH patients and NGS can help to identify FH cau sing mutations in Latvian population.

21255,"Fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) is a key regulator of phosphate homeo stasis. It is of crucial importance in hereditary and acquired hypo and hy perphosphatemic disorders. Moreover, FGF23 has emerged as a promising biomarker for the prediction of adverse clinical outcomes in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), as it might be related to mortality, cardio vascular abnormalities and disease progression. FGF23 is a bone derived endocrine factor, which inhibits renal tubular phosphate reabsorption by activating receptor complexes composed of FGF receptor (FGFR) 1c and the co receptor Klotho. As a major signalling pathway mitogen activated pro tein kinase (MAPK) pathway is employed. For the investigation of FGF23 in an in vitro model we established FGF23 inducible HEK293 cells that stably express Klotho (HEK293 KL). The induction of HEK293 KL cells by FGF23 was shown by detecting the activation of MAPK pathway, which could be re duced by the use of two known small molecule inhibitors of MAPK pathway: SU5402 and U0126. To identify novel small molecule compounds that mo dulate FGF23/FGFR1c/Klotho signalling, we developed a cell based repor ter assay that is suited for high throughput screening (HTS). The assay is based on the AlphaScreen SureFire platform of Perkin Elmer to monitor the phosphorylation of endogenous extracellular signal regulated kinase 1 and 2 (ERK1/2) in cellular lysates of HEK293 KL after the induction with FGF23 in the presence of small molecule compounds. Since increased plasma con centrations of FGF23 are the main cause of many phosphatemic disorders, a modulation of its effect could be a potential strategy for drug discovery and new therapeutic approaches in disorders affecting phosphate homeostasis.",2014
21256,"Gaucher disease [GD] is an autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disease, with deficient glucocerebrosidase activity caused by mutations in the GBA gene. Patients are often categorized as manifesting three distinct pheno types: non neuronopathic [type 1]; severe, infantile neurologic [type 2]; and chronic, progressive neurologic [type 3]. We describe a male infant with neurologic GD as well as concomitant Langerhans cell histiocytosis [LCH]. The child presented at age 9 months with weight loss, hematochezia, pallor, and irritability. He had hepatosplenomegaly, anemia, thrombocytopenia, as well as a right upper lobe nodule. Excisional biopsy of the nodule led to a histologic diagnosis of LCH. Bone marrow and rectal biopsies did not reve al findings of LCH, but the presence of macrophages concerning for a sto rage disease.

Upon physical examination, he demonstrated opisthotonic postu ring, hypotonia, horizontal oculomotor apraxia, and swallowing difficulties but was also able to sit with support, was attentive to environmental stimuli, and had not lost previously gained developmental skills. To our knowledge, this is the first GD patient reported with concomitant LCH. Even though the simultaneous occurrence of GD and LCH could be coincidental, it is also pos sible that LCH is secondary to the specific GBA mutation identified in the pa tient and thus LCH should be added to the list of lymphoreticular neoplasms associated with GD.",2014

Gaucher disease (GD) is a lysosomal storage disorder due to an inherited deficiency of the lysososmal enzyme glucocerebrosidase (GBA1). It produ ces the accumulation of glucosylceramide in cells of the reticuloentothelial system and causes multisystemic manifestations. The limited efficacy of the current treatments has led to the development of new strategies, including the use of pharmacological chaperones. These are small molecules, gene rally competitive inhibitors of the target enzyme, which at sub inhibitory concentrations may induce the proper folding and trafficking of the mutated enzyme resulting in a concomitant increase in the residual activity. The aim of this work is to report on the ability of seven compounds to increase the residual GBA1 activity on fibroblasts from six Gaucher patients bearing dif ferent genotypes. This series of compounds, named DIX, has been designed by combination of the iminoxylitol scaffold of parent 1C9DIX with triazolyl alkyl side chains as GBA1 enhancers as potential pharmacological chapero nes in GD. Most of the DIX compounds showed a preferential GBA1 enhan cement towards genotypes bearing the G202R mutation, responsible for a neuronopathic phenotype of the disease. In particular, DIX 28 was the one with the best activity enhancement, reaching a 4 5 fold increase at100 nM. Moreover this compound showed also a remarkable effect, around 2 fold increase, on the N370S/N370S genotype at the same concentration. Finally, immunofluorescence staining and confocal microscopy imaging were used to confirm that DIX28 increases the trafficking of the G202R mutant enzy me to the lysosome.",2014

The recurrent mutation W1327X in exon 31 was identified in the Tunisian population, suggesting a founder effect. In this present study, we report a phenotype genotype correlation of this frequent mutation.

Hyperornithinemia hyperammonemia homocitrullinuria (HHH) syndrome is an autosomal recessive multisystemic disorder characterized by mental retardation and myoclonic seizures. It is caused by mutations in ORNT1 encoding the mitochondrial ornithine transporter. In placentate mammals there is a second gene, ORNT2, that originated from a retro transposition event, whose precise function has not been clarified. In yeast the major func tion of this transporter (encoded by ARG11) is to shuttle ornithine from the mitochondrial matrix to the cytosol. We employed a yeast model to study the function of human ORNT2 and to test the pathogenicity of mutations found in HHH patients. The two human Ornithine transporters were expressed into the ÃÂARG11 strain. We found that ORNT1 but not ORNT2 complements the deletion of the yeast gene. Three ORNT1 residues, conserved from yeast to humans, are not conserved in ORNT2. We could recover ORNT2 activity by replacing these three resi dues with those found in ORNT1. This result suggests that, despite the high level of homology between the two transporters, their function is not over lapping. We used our yeast model to test the effect of missense mutations carried by patients with HHH syndrome. All missense mutations tested have a detrimental effect on the function of the human gene indicating that yeast is a simple and effective system to validate missense mutations occurring in patients with HHH.",2014

In 1 case, a homozygous null mutation in HIBCH caused congenital anomalies including a characteristic facial ap pearance, congenital heart disease, and multiple vertebral anomalies and led to death in infancy. The 3 other cases, which harbored missense or splice mutations, presented with hypotonia, neurological regression, developmen tal delay in infancy, episodes of ketoacidosis, and abnormal MRI findings in the basal ganglia. Here, we describe a case of Leigh like disease in Japanese siblings with HIBCH deficiency who presented with developmental delay in infancy, abnormal MRI findings in the globus pallidus, and remarkable keto acidosis without highly increased levels of pyruvate and lactate in the CNS during infections. The patients died before the age of 5. A new homozygous missense mutation was identified at the substrate binging site in these pa tients, and their parents were found to be heterozygous for this mutation. The levels of HIBCH activity in patient lymphoblastoid cells and HEK293 cells transiently expressing a mutant HIBCH confirmed that the patients had HIBCH deficiency. HIBCH deficiency leads to the accumulation of the HIB CH substrate 3 hydroxyisobutyryl CoA and subsequently an increase in the amount of methacrylyl CoA in the mitochondrial matrix. The methacrylyl CoA then strongly binds to thiol compounds (cysteamine, cysteine, gluta thione) and reduces the activity of mitochondrial enzymes by binding to their SH residues, thus leading to a dramatically decreased reduction state and reduced ATP production.",2014

LPI can be considered a multisystem disea se which can be life threatening. The main symptoms of LPI include protein aversion, failure to thrive, osteoporosis and hepatosplenomegaly. However, despite the homogenous mutation in the Finnish LPI patients, symptoms may vary markedly even within one family and may include severe compli cations, such as alveolar proteinosis and end stage renal disease. Some LPI patients also suffer from combined hyperlipidemia. Our recent microarray study revealed that also other amino acid transporter genes than SLC7A7, including non cationic amino acid transporters, have changes in their expression levels in LPI patients compared to the controls. Therefore, LPI patients seem to have wide and persistent changes in their amino acid balance.

This mutation leads to different clinical symptoms according to heteroplasmy levels in different tissues. Usually, the first presentation of the MIDD syndrome is a progressive bilate ral sensorineural hearing loss emerging in adolescence. Diabetes develops mostly in 30 40 years of life with clinical picture resembling type 2 dia betes. The MELAS syndrome has a more severe progression with further neurological and metabolic symptoms. We tested 317 patients from 257 families with suspected MIDD or MELAS syndromes fulfilling criteria of matrilineal inheritance, conjoint diabe tes and hearing impairment, diabetes development after 25th year of life, or progressive hearing loss. PatientsÃÂ´ DNA was extracted from peripheral blood and/or buccal mucosa and analysed for presence of m.3243A>G vari ant using RFLP and/or Real Time PCR. The m.3243A>G mutation was found in 18 patients from 8 families. The heteroplasmy was higher in DNA samples from buccal swabs compared to blood DNA samples. In one case, the heteroplasmy was detected in the buc cal DNA only, while the DNA sample gave negative results repeatedly. Pati entsÃÂ´ phenotypes varied from diabetes as the sole symptom to a complex picture of the MELAS syndrome.

No systematic study has been carried out to assess the genetic spectrum of early onset extreme obesity in a single population. The present on going study was undertaken to iden tify genetic variants in a cohort of 46 unrelated children with early onset severe obesity. All subjects were first screened for mutations in the leptin (LEP) and melanocortin 4 receptor (MC4R) genes by direct sequencing. Sub jects found negative for these two genes, were subsequently screened using microdroplet PCR enrichment (RainDance) combined with NGS. Of the 46 severely obese subjects, we identified 14 subjects carrying loss of function homozygous mutations in three genes that are directly involved in leptin melancortin signaling. Of these, 9 subjects carried mutations in LEP , 3 in LEPR and 2 in MC4R. The genetic variants identified here included a novel LEP and LEPR mutation. All mutants had a BMI SDS for age > 3 and were extremely hyperphagic. However, the phenotypic features of MC4R mutants were less severe compared to those carrying LEP and LEPR mutations. The se results together with the findings reported by us previously for the same consanguineous population, add up to 28 (25%) of a total of 110 severely obese children, with known or novel homozygous mutations in the 3 genes. Novel genetic findings leading to severe obesity in the remaining probands through screening by whole exome sequencing, is to be anticipated.",2014

21270,"Mitochondrial DNA mutations are known to cause highly heterogeneous phenotypes and their functional effects are often difficult to assess. Here we present a novel pathogenicity mechanism for two mtDNA variants found in ribosomal RNA genes. The whole mtDNA was screened in a patient who dis played clinical indications of mitochondriopathy, including hypoacusia and 37% deficit of mitochondrial complex I activity in muscle. No protein coding mutations were identified, albeit two rare variants in ribosomal RNA genes, namely m.1452T>C/RNR1 and m.2397C>T/RNR2, both homoplasmic and present in the proband mother, who also displayed hypoacusia. Low popula tion frequency was revealed for both variants by using the HmtDB database, which collects nearly 16,000 human mitochondrial genomes. Although the two variants were present in tips of the haplogroups tree, they were never found to co occur in the same individual, implicating a potential mutual ex clusivity. Therefore, it was hypothesized that their co existence might lead to perturbations in mitochondrial ribosomal assembly. To this aim, since the patientÃ¢ÂÂs fibroblasts displayed a normal basal respiration and complex I function, mitochondrial proteins translation kinetics was analyzed in cy brids derived from patient and control fibroblasts. Patient derived cybrids showed reduced synthesis of mitochondrial proteins and less efficient re covery of complex I activity after treatment with mitochondrial translati on inhibitors. These results imply that the combination of the two variants might lead to mitochondrial translation defects, mainly affecting complex I function, especially in cells with a high energy demand.",2014

Here we report two new large genetic rearrangements detected at the heterozygous level in two patients (Pt1 and Pt2) affected by Morquio A. The deletions include part of the PIEZO1 gene (piezo type mechanosensitive ion channel component 1) whose mutations were found in the dehydrated hereditary stomatocitosis, a dominant auto somal recessive syndrome.

The diagnosis of MPSII based on clinical symptoms and increased excretion of glycosaminoglycans in urine is confirmed by enzymatic assay and mutati on analysis. We performed mutation analysis in 24 unrelated male patients and found 21 different mutations: two large and four small deletions, three small insertions, two splicing defects, two nonsense mutations, seven mis sense mutations and a recombination between IDS gene and pseudogene IDS2 .

Neutral Lipid Storage Disease with Myopathy (NLSDM), is a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by an abnormal accumulation of triacylgly cerol into cytoplasmic lipid droplets (LDs). Mutations in the PNPLA2 gene cause the onset of NLSDM. PNPLA2 codes for adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL), an enzyme that hydrolyses fatty acids from triacylglycerol. NLSDM patients are mainly affected by progressive myopathy, cardiomyopathy and hepatomegaly. Other clinical symptoms may include diabetes, chronic pan creatitis and short stature. To our best knowledge, twenty six different PN PLA2 mutations have been described in thirty two NLSDM patients. Here we report the clinical and genetic findings of a NLSDM Italian family with different affected members. In our patients we identified two novel PNPLA2 missense mutations (pL56R and pI193F). Since age of 38 years, the oldest brother had weakness and hypotrophy of right upper arm and kyphosis. He is now unable to raise arms in horizontal position (61 years old). The second brother, since 44 years of age, had exercise intolerance, cramps and pain in lower limbs. He currently has a distal amyotrophy. Genetic analysis revealed that also one of the two sisters presents the pL56R and pI193F mutations, but she is still barely symptomatic. Using a functional in vitro assay, we have observed that these mutations caused the production of ATGL proteins with diminish lipase activity, but able to bind to LDs. This is a very interesting family since it shows heterogeneity of clinical presentation from relatively asymptomatic phenotype to full expression of a severe myopathy.",2014
21276,"C. O.San Filippo Neri, Roma, Italy. NLSD M (Neutral Lipid Storage Disease with Myopathy) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by an abnormal intracellular accumulation of triacylglycerol into cytoplasmic lipid droplets (LDs). In most tissues the lipid droplets (LDs) are cellular organelles for the triacylglycerol storage. LDs metabolic functions are mediated by proteins bound to their surface. In particular, the lipase that catalyzes the removal of the first acyl chain from triacylglycerol is the patatin like phospholipase domain containing protein 2 (PNPLA2). This protein is coded by the PNPLA2 gene whose mutations cause the onset of Neutral Lipid Storage Disease with Myopathy. NLSD M patients are affected by progressive myopathy, cardiomyopathy and hepa tomegaly. Other clinical symptoms may include diabetes, chronic pancrea titis and short stature. NLSD M has, at present, no specific therapy. We have previously reported clinical and genetic findings of some NLSD M patients obtaining dermal biopsies from them. Here we report the development of hiPSc (human induced pluripotent stem cell) from patientsÃ¢ÂÂ fibroblasts harboring different PNPLA2 mutations. Initial hiPSc colony selection was based on morphologic evaluation and on detection of pluripotency surface markers (SSEA 4 and TRA 1 81). HiPSc also expressed undifferentiated ES cell markers (NANOG, SOX2 and OCT4). Karyotypic analysis of hiPSc lines indicated a normal complement of chromosomes. Immunohystochemical evaluations of LDs on hiPSc revealed that they recapitulate pathological hallmark of the disease. We propose use of differentiated cells derived from hiPSc to study the pathogenetic mechanisms leading to NLSD M and as a cellular model for therapeutic evaluation.",2014

Moreover, the SH2B1 protein has been shown to act as a positive regulator of leptin signaling. As such, it seems plausible that rare SH2B1 variants might exist that influence food intake and weight regulation. Therefore, we have designed an extensive mu tation analysis investigating the prevalence of genetic variation in SH2B1 in both Belgian obese and lean individuals. We have screened 500 obese child ren and adolescents and 500 healthy, lean individuals for mutations with high resolution melting curve analysis. Direct sequencing was performed for samples with melting patterns deviating from wild type. Screening of all coding exons and intron exon boundaries in SH2B1 identified thirteen diffe rent non synonymous heterozygous variants in our populations. Several of these were found both in lean and obese subjects, suggesting these are com mon polymorphisms. However, five private, heterozygous, non synonymous variations were present in obese children only. Furthermore, we also iden tified five variants solely in lean individuals. Our mutation analysis has de monstrated that variation in the SH2B1 gene is frequent in both groups, with distinctive variations being present on either side of the weight spectrum. We therefore speculate that both weight increasing and weight decreasing variations exist in SH2B1 for which different functional effects can be reco gnized. Further functional testing of the variants identified here will thus be necessary to fully understand the impact of these variants on SH2B1 and the leptin signaling pathway.",2014

Lack of peroxisomes or dysfunction in any of their normal functions is the cellular basis for human peroxisomal disorders (PDs). Aim of the Work: diagnosis of peroxisomal disorders among a high risk group of Egyptian patients using gas chromatography mass spectrometry. Subjects and Methods: Forty six patients suspected to have peroxisomal dis orders were included in this study. Their ages ranged from 2 to 20 years. They were referred to The Biochemical Genetics Department, National Re search Centre from all over Egypt. Forty one (89%) were males while five were females (11%). Parental consanguinity was positive in 28 cases (61% out of 46). Very long chain fatty acids were quantified after extraction from plasma of all cases using gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) technique. Results: The present study included 46 cases suspected clinically to have one of the peroxisomal disorders; four of them (8.7%) proved to have X linked adrenoleukodystrophy by quantitative determination of the very long chain fatty acids after extraction from their plasma. The other 42 cases showed normal profile for very long chain fatty acids. Conclusion: X linked adrenoleukodystrophy is the only type diagnosed among the study group of the suspected Egyptian cases. This study showed that GC/MS analysis for VLCFA discriminates patients from controls, repre senting a non invasive, reliable, specific and sensitive method for the dia gnosis of peroxisomal disorders.

It is the most common peroxisomal disorder with an estimated birth incidence of about 1 out of every 20,000. There is no ethnic predominance. X ALD most severely affects male hemizygotes. The age of onset and morbi dity are highly variable and progression is unpredictable. Male hemizygotes may initially present with neurological symptoms in two different forms:(X ALD) with childhood presentations, and Adrenomyeloneuropathy (AMN) that presents in adulthood. X ALD, affects 4 to 8 year old boys. Primary manifestations of X ALD are mo derate cognitive deficits followed by diminished visual acuity, central deaf ness, cerebellar ataxia, hemiplegia, convulsions and dementia leading to a neurovegetative state or death within several years. X ALD is inherited in an X linked manner. About 93% of index cases have inherited the ABCD1 mutation from one parent; and 7% of individuals have a de novo mutation. The diagnosis of X ALD is based on clinical findings. MRI is always abnormal in males with neurologic symptoms and often provides the first diagnostic lead.

In GCKR gene, rs780094 genotyped using the Centaurus (Nanogen) platform in DeCODE genetics. Association of T allele with metabolic syndrome and lipid related variables (e.g. triglyceride, cholesterol, HDL and LDL) was tested using plink software after age and sex adjustment. Results: Replicating previous fin dings TLGS participants showed that T allele of rs780094 was associated with higher triglyceride levels (p <10Ã¢ÂÂ8), higher cholesterol levels (p < 0.05) and metabolic syndrome prevalence (p < 0.0025). Conclusion: Our findings showed the association between the presence of T allele in rs780094 and metabolic syndrome and related traits among Iranian population and con firmed previous result in other ethnicity.",2014
21287,"Sengers syndrome is a rare autosomal recessive condition (prevalence < 1/1 000 000) associating congenital cataract, hypertrophic cardiomyopa thy, skeletal myopathy and exercise related lactic acidosis. We report on a non consanguineous, full term, eutrophic child with bila teral congenital cataract. Metabolic investigations were normal. Cataract surgery was early performed. At three weeks and three months of age, du ring an infectious episode, the infant developed respiratory distress, and deceased from cardiac insufficiency. X ray revealed cardiomegaly, and seve re lactic acidosis was found in blood sample. No genetic analysis could be performed in the patient. Thus we decided to analyse acylglycerol kinase (AGK) gene in both parents in this context. We identified heterozygous mutations in AGK gene in both parents allo wing retrospective diagnosis of Sengers syndrome in the child and clear genetic counselling for the family. The management of congenital cataract should be very early and exhau stively performed, to exclude Sengers syndrome, considering the risk of cardiac failure during cataract surgery or during any intercurrent infec tious episode. Literature does not propose systematic and consensual investigations for bilateral congenital cataract. However, the wide range of aetiologies of congenital cataracts implies various but specific and appropriate manage ments. This case highlights the interest of cardiac ultrasounds in congenital cataract investigation.",2014
21288,"Polyprenol reductase encoded by SRD5A3 gene plays crucial role in the dolichol cycle by catalyzing the conversion of polyprenol to dolichol. Phos phorylated derivatives of dolichol are key molecules in protein glycosylation and glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor biosynthesis. Decreased content of dolichols due to the mutations in SRD5A3 gene has catastrophic conse quences for the cell since it results in hypoglycosylation of proteins and in human manifests as Congenital Disorders of Glycosylation. SRD5A3 CDG pa tients have shown a substantial phenotypic variability despite the presence of truncating mutations in all of them. Biochemical and molecular studies on the cellular model of SRD5A3 deficiency are necessary for better under standing of the biological consequences of decreased level of dolichols and identification of the correlation between mutations found in SRD5A3 with clinical symptoms. To this end we established an in vitro system of HEK293 cells expressing miRNA silencing endogenous SRD5A3 in an inducible manner under a tetra cycline regulated promoter complemented by mutated variants of SRD5A3 . Selected cell lines will be used for the analysis of various cellular effects of dolichol deficiency: protein N glycosylation, O mannosylation and GPI biosynthesis, isoprenoid lipid homeostasis, expression of selected genes. Furthermore, the model might be useful for SRD5A3 CDG diagnostics and possible therapy development by maintaining the cellular dolichol/dolichyl phosphate pool at optimal level.",2014
21289,"Inborn errors of vitamin B12 (cobalamin) metabolism result in homocystin uria and methylmalonic aciduria, either alone or in combination. The most common error, cblC caused by mutations in MMACHC , results in the combi ned metabolic phenotype. We recently described a biochemically similar in born error, cblX , caused by mutations in the gene for the X linked transcrip tional coregulator HCFC1, which activates the transcription of MMACHC . The cblX patients were originally diagnosed as cblC ; however they have a severe neurological and milder biochemical phenotype than most cblC patients (Yu et al . AJHG, 2013, 93:5). One patient, characterized as cblC by complemen tation analysis, had no mutations in either MMACHC or HCFC1 by Sanger sequencing. Clinically, he had methylmalonic aciduria, encephalopathy, pro found mental retardation, seizures and tetraplegia and died at age 10. His biochemical manifestations were mild, with higher cellular function of both cobalamin dependent enzymes than normally seen from cblC patients and no homocysteine elevation. Sequencing of patient genomic DNA identified a homozygous mutation, c.240C>G (p. F80L) in THAP11 , the gene encoding a zinc finger transcription factor that functions with HCFC1. The mutation affects a residue located in a conserved zinc finger containing domain, two residues away from P78, responsible for interacting with the zinc ion, and is predicted to be probably damaging by Polyphen 2. F80 is conserved to ze brafish and in 9/12 human THAP proteins. Transcriptome profiling showed significant down regulation of the same group of genes, including MMACHC , in fibroblasts from cblX and the THAP11 patient.",2014

21291,"Background: Neurologic impairments in female heterozygotes for X linked Adrenoleukodystrophy (X ALD) are poorly understood. Our aims were to describe the neurological and neurophysiological manifestations of a cohort of X ALD heterozygotes, and to correlate them with age, disease duration, mutations, X inactivation and serum concentrations of a marker of neuronal damage, NSE. Methods: All 45 heterozygotes of our institution, with pre vious VLCFA and molecular diagnosis, were invited to be evaluated through myelopathy scales JOA and SSPROM, nerve conduction studies and somato sensory evoked responses. X inactivation pattern was tested by HUMARA methylation assay. Serum NSE was measured by eletrochemiluminescense. Results: Thirty three heterozygotes were recruited: 29 (87%) were sympto matic. Symptomatic and asymptomatic women presented different mÃÂ±sd ages (43.9 ÃÂ± 10.2 versus 24.3 ÃÂ± 4.6), JOA (14.5 ÃÂ± 1.7 versus 16.6 ÃÂ± 0.2) and SSPROM (86.6 ÃÂ± 7.9 versus 98.4 ÃÂ± 1.1) scores (p<0.05). Both JOA (r , 0.68) and SSPROM (r , 0.65) correlated with age (p , 0.0001, Spearman). De layed central ascending conduction studies on the lower limbs were pre sent in 72% of all heterozygotes, and correlated with SSPROM (r , 0.47, p , 0.018, Spearman). NSE values were higher in heterozygotes than in controls (12.9 ÃÂ± 7 and 7.2 ÃÂ± 7 ng/ml, p , 0.012, Mann Whitney U).. Mutation seve rity and inactivation patterns were not associated with neurologic status. Discussion: Neurologic manifestations, clearly related to age, were more common than expected. JOA and SSPROM scales discriminated asymptoma tic from symptomatic heterozygotes. Both might be useful tools to follow disease progression, in future studies.",2014
21292,"Persons with unexplained early onset stroke have been targeted for scree ning surveys for Fabry disease, the most common of the three X linked lyso somal disorder, because Fabry patients with stroke are more likely to have the life threatening progressive cardiac and renal manifestations and would therefore most benefit from early diagnosis and intervention with enzyme replacement therapy (ERT). Among 173 Israeli patients with unexplained cryptogenic stroke screened for mutations in the Fabry ÃÂ± galactosidase A (GLA) gene, sequencing identified four with 2 4 GLA intronic variants, one of whose father and three sisters had the same variants. Two variants, c.640 16A>G (g.10115A>G) in intron 4 and c.1000 22C>T (g.10956C>T) in intron 6, were common to all patients; only one male with a deletion in intron 2 had low residual enzyme activity; both he and the father had decreased mRNA expression. X chromosome inactivation was not highly skewed in the six fe males. Nonetheless, these cases differ largely from those in the literature of carriers of intronic variants with multi system Fabry disease. These current patients may not benefit from ERT , raising the question whether intronic variants alone are disease causing or whether these patients should be con sidered Ã¢ÂÂmanifesting carriersÃ¢ÂÂ of an X linked recessive disease.",2014
21293,"Objective: Until this day newborns in Palestine are being screened for phe nylketonuria and congenital hypothyroidism only. However, a number of other metabolic diseases have been recognized amongst the population, including amino acid and urea cycle disorders. The study was conducted in an effort to investigate the possibility of finding such cases in newborns throughout the West Bank of Palestine. In addition, reference ranges for a number of amino acids and urea cycle intermediates will be established. Study Design: A cross sectional observational study design was used and the study was conducted in all 12 districts of the West Bank. Convenience sampling was used to recognize the study newly born participants. The sample size was 4240 and an informed consent form was collected from all parents. The study blood collection cards were collected over a one year period by Ministry of Health staff. The study cards were shipped to the Uni versity of Liege Human Genetics Department in Belgium for analysis using tandem mass spectrometry. Results: Statistical analysis showed a significant relationship between weight and some amino acid levels. A significant difference between some amino acid levels and the districts was also observed. The reference range for each amino acid and urea cycle intermediates tested was calculated based on the non parametric percentile method as indicated by CLSI C28 A3.Conclusion: Based on our established reference ranges for each analyte the results showed that 22.5% of the tested samples (955) had at least one ami no acid level in the upper 2.5% of the population.",2014

Inherited macrothrombocytopenia (IMTP) is a highly heterogeneous group of inherited disorders characterized by a low platelet count and abnormally platelet size. Even though IMTP causing mutations have been reported in several genes, only 50% of patients have to date a molecular diagnosis. In March 2013 Kunishima and colleagues identified alpha actinin 1 (ACTN1) as a new gene responsible for IMTP which accounted for 5,5% of cases in Japanese population. To evaluate the frequency of ACTN1 mutations in the Italian population, we performed a screening in 160 probands in which all the known forms of IMTP were previously excluded. Ten, including 8 no vel, different missense have been identified in 11 patients. All except one (p. D666V) segregated with the macrotrombocytopenia within the fami lies. In vivo transfection experiments in Hela cells were performed to de monstrate the pathogenicity of the variants identified. Except for p. D666V, preliminary data indicate that the missense mutations are associated with disorganization of cytoskeleton, as determined different co localization of mutant and wild type actinin a with actin. Further studies will be needed to determine how these mutations may lead to the onset of disease.",2014
21295,"Anti apoptotic genes such as Mcl 1 or survivin may be responsible for resi stance to apoptosis induced by chemotherapeutic drugs. The aim of this stu dy was to investigate whether the knockdown of Mcl 1 or survivin expres sion by small interfering RNA (siRNA) would sensitize HL 60 acute myeloid leukemia cells to etoposide. Knockdown of Mcl 1 or survivin expression was confirmed by quantitative real time PCR and Western Blotting. The effects of Mcl 1 or survivin down regulation on the chemosensitivity of the cells was assessed by the MTT assay. Cell viability and apoptosis were also deter mined using the trypan blue exclusion assay and the annexin V/PI double staining method, respectively. Transfection of siRNAs markedly decreased the expression levels of both Mcl 1 and survivin genes in a time dependent manner. Down regulation of Mcl 1 or survivin significantly inhibited the proliferation and enhanced the chemosensitivity of the cells. Furthermore, pretreatment with siRNAs clearly enhanced the etoposide mediated apo ptosis of the leukemic cells. Surprisingly, siRNA co transfection had a more antileukemic effect relative to the single siRNA transfection. Our study de monstrates that a triple approach involving siRNA mediated silencing of the Mcl 1 and survivin along with chemotherapeutic drugs could potentially be used to lower the effective doses of the chemotherapeutic drugs and reduce drug related toxicities.",2014
21296,"The joint application of clinical and genetic investigations has greatly expan ded the knowledge of inherited thrombocytopenias, leading to characteri zation of new forms, such as ANKRD26 related disease (ANKRD26 RD). AN KRD26 RD is characterized by thrombocytopenia and bleeding tendency, as well as an increased risk of leukemia. Since the identification of ANKRD26, as the gene responsible for the disease, 12 different mutations, all localized in a short stretch of 22 nucleotides in the 5Ã¢ÂÂUTR, have been identified. To further investigate their effect, we tested the activity of the basal promoter together with the wt or the mutant 5Ã¢ÂÂUTR in a reporter assay. In a megaka ryocytic cell line, mutations generated a statistically significant increase of the luciferase activity, suggesting that the 5Ã¢ÂÂUTR plays a role in inhibiting the expression of ANKRD26 during megakaryopoiesis. Consistent with this hypothesis, ANKRD26 is expressed in human CD34+ and BFU E but it is hardly detectable in megakaryocytes. Bioinformatic analysis revealed puta tive binding sites for transcription factors in the region hit by mutations. In order to identify these factors, we performed electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA). Among different complexes of the same size in both wt and mutant samples, we observed an additional band generated by two mutant probes. Experiments of super shift EMSA are in progress to characterize the pathogenetic factor(s) that could interfere with the physiological control of the ANKRD26 expression.",2014

With the mean carrier frequency of ÃÂ² thalassemia being 2.1% in the general population, and rates as high as 10% concentrated in certain regions of the country, hemoglobin electrophoresis of the indivi duals at premarital stage and molecular diagnosis of the carrier individu als for genetic counseling cannot be overstated. Targeted diagnosis of the HBB gene mutations can be readily obtained using commercially available reverse dot blotting kits. A sequence analysis of the complete HBB gene co vering UTR and near gene regions provides a 99% mutation detection rate. We report here a summary finding of HBB gene analysis for 163 Turkish patients, along with their family members totaling 248 individuals, refer red with beta thalassemia indications covering the period of 2010 2014. 39 were found to have homozygous, 31 possessed compound heterozygous and 63 possessed heterozygous mutations. Overall, a total of 205 alleles were found to have mutations. The first 15 frequented mutations covered 88% of the entirety of all mutations. The summary range is as follows: c.93 21 G>A (IVS1+110G>A) 30.7%; c.135delC (p.ser45fs) 7.8%; c.92+1G>A (IVS I 1) 7.8%; c.25_26delAA (p. Lys9Valfs) 5.9%; c.20A>T (p. Glu7Val) 4.9%; c.92+6T>C (IVS I 6) 4.9%. We discuss that the commercial targeted kits detect up to 80% of the HBB mutations for our patients. Sequence analysis of the HBB gene from 5Ã¢ÂÂ promoter ( 250bp) to 3Ã¢ÂÂ promoter region (*250bp) contributes 15% to the mutation detection rate.",2014

21299,"IPEX like patients have clinical features resembling IPEX syndrome (Im mune dysregulation, Polyendocrinopathy, Enteropathy, X linked) without mutations in the FOXP3 gene (Xp11.23), that encodes a transcriptional re gulator critical for the development and function of CD4 +CD25+ regulatory T cells. These cells are indispensable for the maintenance of immune self tolerance and homeostasis by suppressing aberrant or excessive immune responses. IL2Ralfa and STAT5b are two genes whose deficiency has been associated with IPEX like syndrome and both encode proteins involved in FOXP3 pa thway. IL2Ralfa codes for the alfa subunit (CD25) of the receptor complex for IL2, and the interaction between IL2 IL2Ralfa is the first step that trigger FOXP3 trascription. In this study we describe the identification of three different point mutati ons affecting IL2R alfa one of them was recently published by our group and the other two were never reported in literature. All variations are missense mutations leading to a single aminoacid substi tution that modify the protein structure. Two are located in exon 4 and alter the Ã¢ÂÂsushiÃ¢ÂÂ domain that seems to be fundamental for IL2 IL2Ralfa interac tion, the third mutation determines the substitution of a cysteine that may be involved in the formation of a disulfide bond, thus causing the alteration of the tertiary structure of the receptor. Cytofluorimetric analysis revealed total absence of CD25 expression in all three patients, strengthening the hypothesis that these mutations cause the disruption of the receptor structure thus leading to its degradation. Further studies are ongoing to better characterize the consequence of these mutati ons from the molecular and cellular point of view.",2014
21300,"Diamond Blackfan Anemia (DBA) is a rare inherited anemia. Heterozygous mutations in one of 11 ribosomal protein genes cause defective ribosome biogenesis. Erythroid progenitors (BFU E and CFU E) in bone marrow (BM) show a proapoptotic phenotype. Suspicion of DBA is reached after exclusion of other forms of BM failure syndromes and the diagnosis is confirmed by mutations analysis. To improve DBA diagnosis, we tested a new approach based on the study of extracellular vesicles (EVs). EVs have been isolated from plasma of patients with DBA and appropriate controls by differenti al centrifugations and analyzed by flow cytometry. To study erythroid EVs we evaluated three erythroid markers: CD34, CD71 and CD235a. EVs im munophenotypic profiles of 8 patients with DBA, 20 healthy controls and 10 patients with other hematological diseases have been characterized. We were able to identify different clusters: CD71+/CD34 , CD34+/CD71low and CD235a+. In all gates the absolute number of EVs/ÃÂµl has been evaluated. Only the CD34+/CD71low population is significantly different between pati ents with DBA and controls (p< 0,05). This population that is always present in healthy controls, is absent in patients with DBA. The absence of CD34+/ CD71low population in DBA patients plasma is in agreement with the low level of erythroid progenitors in the patientsÃ¢ÂÂ BM. The area under the ROC curve that compares patients with DBA and healthy controls is 0.92. Further analyses are needed to ascertain whether this assay may be used in the cli nics.",2014
21301,"Diamond Blackfan anemia (DBA MIM # 105650 ) is an inherited erythro id aplasia caused by mutations in 11 genes encoding ribosomal proteins of the small (RPS) or the large ( RPL) subunit. The 28S, 5.8S and 18S rRNAs are transcribed as a single precursor that is processed into mature rRNAs, which form the ribosomal subunits with the RPs. Mutations in a RPS or a RPL alter the processing of 18S or 28S and 5.8S rRNAs, respectively. The analysis of pre rRNA by Northern blot in cell models or lymphoblastoid cells from patients shows different patterns of precursors depending on which RP is mutated. Mutation analysis of 11 genes is needed to confirm the diagnosis. We have looked whether rRNA analysis of activated lymphocytes could improve the DBA diagnostic approach. We extracted total RNA from activated lympho cytes of patients with DBA (4 mutated in RPS19, 1 in RPS17, 2 in RPL11, 4 in RPL5 and 5 with unknown mutations). Northern blot analysis was per formed using appropriate probes. All the patients with a mutation in a RPL showed the accumulation of a 32S precursor that is visible also by ethidium bromide staining. Northern blot analysis allowed to discriminate patients with mutations in RPS19 from those with mutations in RPS17. We observed the rRNA maturation defect also in a patient with a mutation in RPL5 after stable remission from the disease. This is the first demonstration of rRNA abnormalities in patient lymphocy tes. rRNA processing analysis is a useful approach to direct the subsequent mutational screening.",2014
21302,"BackgroundInherited deficiency of coagulation factor X(FX) is a rare bleeding disorder with prevalence of 1 per 500,000 in general population. Mostly, the conditi on is associated with missense mutation, which is a valuable clue. Case and resultsA six month old infant was hospitalized due to fever, lethargy and seizure with no significant medical history. Symptoms were attributable to brain abscess subsequently diagnosed. For operability evaluation, prothrombin time (PT) and activated partial thromboplastin time tests were performed, and the results were prolonged to 121.6 seconds and 109.1 seconds, respec tively. Coagulation factor activities were also measured. Factor II, V, X activi ties were 80%, 99% and 1%, respectively. Factor VII, VIII, IX, XI and XII acti vities were all in normal ranges. FX activity of the parents was not tested due to refusal of family study. FX of the patient was sequenced on coding regions and exon intron boundaries. We found 1 missense mutation and 1 nonsense mutation of FX (c. C343A in exon 4, c. C487T in exon 5) that correspond to amino acid substitution Q56K and stop codon at Q104, respectively. Both amino acids are located in EGF like domain 1.The patient suffered hematochezia, hematuria, subdural hemorrhage and hemarthrosis which were all irrelevant to the operation. Bleeding was treated with tranexamic acid and fresh frozen plasma with monitoring of FX activity which increased from 1% to 22%.ConclusionThe amino acid substitution of glutamine to lysine at EGF like domain 1 is probably related to functional inactivation of coagulation FX.

21303,"Objectives. Familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) is a recessively transmit ted autoinflammatory disease, caused by mutations in the MEFV gene. The pro inflammatory cytokine IL 1ÃÂ² has been implicated in the pathogenesis of FMF and the balance between IL 1ÃÂ² and its receptor antagonist IL 1RA plays an important role in the development of the disease. Since polymor phisms in the IL 1 gene cluster have been suggested to have an effect on IL 1ÃÂ² and IL 1RA production, our aim was to determine a possible association of specific polymorphisms in IL 1ÃÂ² and IL 1RA genes with susceptibility to and/or severity of FMF. Subjects and Methods. Forty two genetically confirmed FMF patients and 42 controls were genotyped for IL 1ÃÂ²( 511C/T), IL 1ÃÂ²( 31T/C) and IL1 1ÃÂ²(+3954T/C) polymorphisms by PCR digestion. The IL 1RA VNTR was identified by fragment size analysis. IL 1ÃÂ² and IL 1RA levels were evaluated by Luminex in supernatants of PBMC cultures of 30 FMF patients with and without 24h stimulation of monocytes by LPS. Results. The CC genotype and C allele at positions 31 and +3954 of IL 1ÃÂ² gene were observed more frequently in FMF patients than in controls. No significant difference was observed in the genotypic and allelic frequencies of the IL 1ÃÂ²( 511) polymorphism and IL 1RA VNTR. FMF patients carriers of IL 1ÃÂ²( 31) CC genotype were associated with a 2 fold increase in LPS induced IL 1ÃÂ² secretion, compared to patients carrying other genotypes. Conclusion. These results indicate that IL 1ÃÂ² gene polymorphisms at positi ons 31 and +3954 may be associated with susceptibility to FMF. IL 1ÃÂ²( 31) may also contribute to the severity of the disease, probably by modulating IL 1ÃÂ² secretion.",2014
21304,"Immune response to infection or vaccination is significantly influenced by host genetic components and autoimmune disease associated genetic variants may have stronger influence on such a response. One way to in vestigate the role of genetics in differential susceptibility to infection is to correlate the gene expression levels response to stimulation with autoim mune disease associated SNPs. We performed a pilot experiment by stimu lating peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) of 46 volunteers with four different pathogenes for 4 and 24 hours. Gene expression profile was determined with Illumina arrays and genotype of 366 autoimmune disease associated SNPs were genotyped using Immunochip. Linear model with sti mulation status, genotype and stimulation genotype interaction term was fitted for each probe and SNP . Due to the small sample size, we were not able to identify globally significant pathogen genotype interactions after multiple testing correction, so possibly relevant interactions were prioriti zed based on uncorrected p values, allelic trends and effect size differences between unstimulated and stimulated conditions. 133 SNPs showed inter action effect for at least one probe. The most significant interaction was bet ween rs6087990 and a gene encoding macrophage receptor (uncorrected P,3.72ÃÂ10 5). We were also able to identify SNP gene pairs showing similar stimulation genotype interaction in case of several different stimulations. These genes may play role in the disease susceptibility and serve as possib le candidates for functional studies. The methods and preliminary results from this study reveal novel insights into the role of autoimmune SNPs and underscore the importance of large scale genotype environment interaction studies in future.",2014
21305,"A gluten free diet (GFD) is the most common diet worldwide. It is not only an effective treatment for celiac disease, but also commonly followed by in dividuals with gut complaints. How a GFD affects the human microbiome is largely unknown. We studied changes in the gut microbiome in healthy individuals following a short term GFD. 23 healthy volunteers followed a GFD for 4 weeks. Stool samples were coll ected before the start of the diet, then at weekly intervals during the GFD and again at weekly intervals for 4 weeks on normal diet after a wash out period. The samples were sequenced using 454 sequencing of the 16s rDNA (hyper variable region 3 to 4). We used closed reference picking to cluster reads into OTUs using the 2013 GreenGenes reference. Function imputation of the OTUs, is performed used PiCRUSt and HUMAnN. We observed a limited difference of the GFD intervention, with the intra subject variation being larger than the effect from a short term diet change. However, we did observe that family Veillonellaceae (class Clostridia ) was si gnificantly less present in the GFD samples (p,6.58eÃ¢ÂÂ05, q,0.0132). Based on richness of the samples we were able to define two groups which show a difference in response to a GFD period. The lower richness group showed more bacterial variation in composition during the diet change. Furthermo re, sixteen gene pathways showed significant association to the change in diet. In conclusion, in this we observed changes in microbiome and gene composition associated to a GFD.",2014
21306,"Radboud University Medical Centre, Nijmegen, Netherlands. Gray platelet syndrome (GPS) is a hereditary, usually autosomal recessive bleeding disorder caused by defective production of ÃÂ± granules in platelets. The ÃÂ± granule deficiency may be attributed to the failure of megakaryocytes to efficiently route proteins into ÃÂ± granules, thereby hampering their matu ration. We describe a large family with an autosomal dominant type of GPS characterized by mild to severe bleeding complications. In addition to gray platelets lacking ÃÂ± granules, affected individuals had other GPS associated phenomena like thrombocytopenia, emperipolesis, myelofibrosis and de creased expression of platelet factor 4. To determine the disease causing mutation we performed linkage analysis and identified a candidate locus on chromosome 9q34 (LOD score 3.9). We considered GFI1B (Growth factor independence 1B), located within this region, an excellent candidate gene because of its function as a transcriptional repressor essential in erythroid and megakaryocyte lineages. We identified a nonsense mutation in exon 6 (c.859C>T , p. Gln287*) that co segregated with the GPS. The mutated tran script was not targeted for nonsense mediated mRNA decay, resulting in a protein truncated within its 5th zinc finger, a domain essential for DNA bin ding. Using luciferase reporter assays we demonstrated that the truncated GFI1B protein was unable to repress gene expression and that it inhibited wild type GFI1B in a dominant negative manner. Subsequently, we perfor med an immunophenotypical analysis of affected family members. Myeloid and erythroid lineages were unaffected, but we observed aberrant platelets and dysplastic abnormalities and disturbed lineage marker expression in GFI1B mutated megakaryocytes. These studies define GFI1B to be key to megakaryocyte development, platelet production and ÃÂ± granule biogenesis.",2014

Interaction with other immune effectors as HLA E could also be incriminated. We showed that 2 haplotypes in Tswa Pygmies, HLA G*01:04~E*01:03:01 and G*01:04~E*01:01 exhibited LD va lues. The aim of our study is to explore the region between HLA A and E. We genotyped HLA A, G, H and E alleles in 71 french samples and explore their association. We found that 11 haplotypes represent 75% of all the haplotypes. HLA H deletion was exclusevely associated with A*23~HLA*G01:04~UTR 3 ~HLA*E01:01 and HLA A*24~HLA*G01:04~UTR 3~HLA*E01:03:01 ha plotypes. A new HLA H*02:04(:02) allele was descibed and associated with A*11~HLA*G01:01~UTR 7~HLA*E01:01. This study suggests that the HLA region between HLA A and E loci displays a haplotype conservation that might be the results of biological function. This haplotype conservation has to be further studied to understand their clinical implication.",2014

Some of the HLA DRB1 alleles are encoding shared epitope amino acids that are not conferring the same risk in various popu lations. Our study focuses on the evaluation of the distribution of HLA DRB1 alleles in Romanian patients with early rheumatoid arthritis, along with controls by using PCR SSP method. HLA DRB1 allele genotyping showed statistically significant differences given by a higher allele frequency for *04, *01 and *14. Also, in our study was observed a lower frequency for *03,*11,*13 and *15 alleles in patients group compared with controls. Using a high resolution kit for HLA DRB1 *04 group we found a high frequency for *0404 and *0408 alleles, in con trast with *0401 and *0402 which were significantly lower in patients than in controls. *0403, *0405 were not associated with early rheumatoid arthri tis in our group diagnosed according with new classification criteria ACR/EULAR 2010.Results of our study are demonstrating the need of a continuous work of allele tracing and associating with rheumatoid arthritis, especially in cases early diagnosed in order to create sufficient premises for instituting a cor rect and possibly long term remissive treatment.

21309,"Thrombocytopenia is a common aspect of platelet function disorders (PFDs) which account for a significant proportion of bleeding diatheses. Identifica tion of the genetic basis of congenital thrombocytopenias is often a difficult task due to the variability in clinical presentation and the relative redundan cy of known platelet receptors and signalling pathways. DNA based analysis has therefore previously played a confirmatory role dependant on platelet function testing to validate candidate mutations. Using a novel approach underpinned through the Genotyping and Phenotyping of Platelets (GAPP) study we have extended the DNA based analysis, especially in cases where a qualitative defect is observed, to unravel the underlying genetic defects in patients diagnosed with inherited thrombocytopenia. The combination of platelet function testing, including flow cytometry, with whole exome sequencing provides a complete and complementary platform for efficient and cost effective investigation. Additional integration of a database of 338 platelet related genes into our analysis improves detection and allows for the identification of variants in novel genes for further functional studies. To date our unique workflow has confirmed 14 mutations in 21 index ca ses, including two in novel genes with previously unreported mechanisms within platelet formation or function. Whole exome sequencing is therefore an effective tool to study the molecular genetics of inherited thrombocyto penias with excellent applicability for patient investigation when coupled with platelet function testing.",2014

In addition to the biallelic form, a less severe autosomal dominant form (monoallelic) of BSS is due to mutations identi fied so far in GP1BA or GP1BB . Except for p. Ala172Val (Noris et al, 2012), which is relatively frequent at least in the Italian population, other mutati ons have been reported only in single families. In order to evaluate the fre quency of the monoallelic form in our thrombocytopenic cohort, we selec ted 120 probands with large platelets and no mutations in candidate genes. In 11 cases we found heterozygous mutations in GP1BA (n,4), GPIBB (n,6) and GP9 (n,1). In addition to 4 variants previously identified in biallelic BSS patients, the others are all novel mutations. They are classified as missense (n,8), nonsense (n,1) or frame shift (n,2) mutations. Segregation analy sis within the families showed that only the affected individuals carry the mutations. Functional studies are in progress to determine the effect of the mutations on GPIb IX V complex formation and its capacity to interact with vWF. Considering that half of the patients with inherited thrombocytopenia remain without a molecular diagnosis, we could estimate that the frequency of the monoallelic form of BSS could account for 5% of the cases. This sug gest that monoallelic BSS should be always taken into consideration in the differential diagnosis of inherited thrombocytopenia.",2014

We present results from a Finnish case control discovery sample as well as three independent replication studies from the Swedish, Dutch and Czech populations. We studied four genes in the MHC Class III region (LTA, TNF, AGER, BTNL2) and HLA DRA in relation to HLA DRB1 alleles to detect vari ants predisposing to sarcoidosis and to identify genetic differences between patient subgroups. Patients with sarcoidosis (n,805) were further subdivided based on the disease activity and the presence of LÃÂ¶fgren syndrome. In a meta analysis, seven SNPs were associated with non LÃÂ¶fgren sarcoidosis (NL; the stron gest association with rs3177928 in HLA DRA, P,1.79E 07, OR,1.9) and eight with LÃÂ¶fgren syndrome (LS; the strongest association with rs3129843 in BTNL2/HLA DRA region, P, 3.44E 12, OR,3.4) when compared with healthy controls (n,870). The high LD between SNPs and an HLA DRB1 challenged the result interpretation. In addition to these SNPs, population specific associations for sarcoidosis were observed. In conclusion, there is clear evidence that polymorphisms in the BTNL2 and HLA DRA have a role in sarcoidosis susceptibility.

Mutations in the MEFV gene are known to cause syndrome with PFAPA overlapping symptoms (Familial Mediter ranean Fever), which is common in eastern Mediterranean population, but rarely reported in patients from Slovenia. Objective: The aim of this study was to assess the frequency of MEFV gene mutations in pediatric patients with PFAPA syndrome from Slovenia. Methods: We collected clinical and laboratory data and results of genetic testing of MEFV gene of PFAPA patients under the age of 18, who were follo wed from the beginning of 2006 to the end of 2013. All 10 exons and intron/exon regions of gene were directly sequenced. Results: In total, 91 PFAPA patients were tested for MEFV gene mutations. All of them were under the age of 18, mean age at diagnosis was 7 years. The ratio of women to men was 1:1.15 patients (16%) were found to have at least one mutation. 11 patients (12%) were heterozygote and 4 patients (4%) were compound heterozy gote, 3 with R408Q/P369S and 1 with K695R/I591T mutation. The overall number of mutation found was 19.

Aurora Hospital, Helsinki, Finland. Primary immunodeficiency diseases (PIDD) encompass a wide and hete rogeneous group of disorders caused by mutations in genes with immune function. The molecular mechanisms behind many forms are not yet known. The significant clinical and immunological heterogeneity of PIDD often de lay the diagnosis making treatment challenging. Few thousand individu als are expected to suffer from PIDD in Finland, where the unique genetic background has proven to be very useful in identifying genes for monogenic disorders. An exome sequencing analysis of a Finnish PIDD family characte rized by recurrent prolonged bacterial infections complicated by basal cere bral and frontal infarcts, subarachnoidal hemorrhage and occasional small aneurysms, has identified compound heterozygous mutations in the CECR1 gene not previously implicated in PIDD. The affected individuals carried a splice donor site mutation leading to nonsense mediated decay (NMD) of the allele and a rare missense variant, highly conserved and predicted de leterious. Analysis of the patient sera confirmed that the protein product (ADA2) of the mutated gene had no measurable activity. ADA2 is a member of the adenosine deaminase family, which also includes ADA1, a known cau se of severe combined immune deficiency (SCID). ADA2 is a secreted prote in which binds to cell surface via proteoglycans, may degrade extracellular adenosine and has been shown to induce T cell dependent differentiation of monocytes into macrophages and stimulate macrophage proliferation. Thus ADA2 deficiency is a plausible cause for the immunodeficiency complicated by infarcts and subarachnoidal hemorrhage in this family. The ongoing func tional analyses will shed further light on molecular defects of the disease.",2014

PSS patients have a 15 fold increased risk of developing B cell lymphoma. Increasing evidence suggests an epigenetic contribution in the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases, including pSS. Epigenetic modifications represent a dynamic link between genotype, environment and phenotype, by for example modulating gene expression. As methylation of the DNA base cytosine is considered as a prototypic epigenetic mark, our aim was to investigate the role of DNA methylation in pSS. We performed a genome wide DNA methylation study in purified CD19+ B cells from 17 pSS patients and 28 healthy controls using Il lumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip arrays which cover about 486,000 CpG sites across the genome.

Recently, in generalized pustular psoriasis (GPP), an extreme manifestation of pustular psoriatic disease, homozygous and compound heterozygous mutations in IL36RN have been identified to be causal. The same mutations have been described to be more frequent in a group of 139 European PPP patients. Here, we recruited a group of >140 PPP patients,most of them were female and smokers (>60%, respectively). About half of them had a manifestational age of Ã¢ÂÂ¤40 years. We could con firm previous data showing that the frequency of the HLA C risk allele, the major genetic risk factor for PsV, was comparable to the frequency of con trols, indicating that PPP is genetically different from PsV. We further ana lyzed IL36RN for mutations in coding exons and for intragenic deletions/ duplications. We identified three heterozygous carriers of mutations and no carriers of copy number variants. Compared to a population based control group of 4.300 European individuals, there was no significant difference in the frequency of IL36RN mutations .Our data indicate that PPP is genetically distinct both from PsV and GPP .

21319,"Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is well known as an autoimmune disease and is a chronic inflammatory disorder characterized by the destruction of multiple joints. Many genome wide association studies were performed and multiple RA susceptibility loci and autoimmune susceptibility loci have been iden tified. These studies suggested that multiple genes and its functions were related with disease causing and development. Previouly, peptidylariginine deiminase type 4 (PADI4) was identified as a susceptibility gene for RA in a Japanese population by case control association study (Ref 1). PADI4 is a member of the PADI gene family and converts arginine residue (peptidylar ginine) to citrulline residue (peptidylcitrulline). PADI4 is highly expressed in bone marrow, macrophages, neutrophils and monocytes. PADI genes are important genes in RA, because only PADs (translated protein from PADI genes) can provide antigens of ACPA, which are specific antibodies of RA. To evaluate the importance of PADI4 gene in the progression of RA, we ge nerated Padi4 / DBA1J mice. We used Padi4 / mice to show that PAD4 is significantly affected to progress of collagen induced arthritis (CIA), well known as an RA model animal. In Padi4 / CIA mice sera, the concentrations of serum anti CII IgM, IgG, and levels of inflammatory cytokines decreased significantly rather than in WT CIA mice. Futhermore, the transcription le vels of inflammatory cytokines in CD11b positive splenocytes from Padi4 / CIA mice are also significantly lower than those from WT CIA mice. As the results, we suggested that Padi4 enhanced collagen initiated inflammatory responses. 1) Suzuki, A. et al Nat. Genet.34, 395 402 (2003)",2014

Genome wide association analyses have identified five candi date loci in NSDTR containing several genes. Detailed analysis of the candida te loci identified variants that alter the expression of several of these genes. Multiple genes involved in T cell activation show expression differences, but regulatory mutations also alter expression of genes such as BANK1, involved in human SLE.

21323,"Background: The clinical phenotype of patients with beta hemoglobinopa thies is extremely heterogenous, ranging from nearly asymptomatic forms of thalassemia intermedia to severe transfusion dependent thalassemia major. The wide phenotypical variability is associated with the type of beta globin mutation, the co inheritance of alpha thalassemia and the ability for persistent production of fetal hemoglobin (HbF) in adult life. For the latter, three different quantitative trait loci, accounting for 20 50% of HbF variation, have been identified by now. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the gamma globin gene promoter (HBG2), in the BCL11A gene and the HBS1L MYB intergenic region lead to increased residual HbF levels in adults. Methods: A teststrip based reverse hybridisation assay was de veloped for the simultaneous detection of SNPs in the HBG2 (g. 158 C>T), BCL11A (rs1447407, rs10189857), HBS1L MYB (rs28384513, rs9399137) genes. Results: The new StripAssay enables the concomitant identification of genetic variants known to influence beta thalassemia disease severity. Based on the presence of positively modifying alleles, and combined with alpha and beta globin genotyping, it allows the prediction of patients likely to display less severe phenotypes. Favourable properties, such as the rapid DNA extraction protocol, ready to use reagents and teststrips, as well as the potential for automation of the hybridisation/detection and interpretation steps, make the StripAssay convenient and easy to perform within less than six hours. Conclusions: Testing for genetic modifiers influencing disease se verity will lead to more specific and effective treatment, and support clinical decisions regarding the beginning of transfusion therapy in beta thalasse mia patients. Furthermore, the knowledge about prognostic markers has implications for genetic counselling and prenatal diagnosis.",2014

21328,"The case of a 10 ÃÂ½ year old boy from Germany is presented with a new dia gnosis of NOMID syndrome, also known as CINCA syndrome, the rarest and most severe of the Cryopyrin associated periodic syndromes (CAPS), which are genetic syndromes of autoinflammation. The diagnosis was delayed de spite many clinical clues including the typical non itching maculopapular rash which was present from the neonatal period, raised inflammatory mar kers on many occasions without detectable infectious pathogens, progres sive macrocephaly with hydrocephalus, evolving short stature, progressive optic atrophy, progressive deafness, progressive arthropathy and other non specific haematological and immunological abnormalities. In addition, the patient had episodic conjunctivitis and finger clubbing. Periodic fever does not always occur in this condition and in the case of this patient was com pletely absent. This patient was treated for several years with growth hor mone in the absence of a diagnosis without any improvement of his short stature. Early diagnosis of these patients is vital because treatment with in terleukin 1 receptor antagonists is now well established and very effective. Untreated, the patients may develop a destructive arthropathy, blindness, profound deafness and renal failure secondary to amyloidosis. The macroce phaly, hydrocephalus and short stature result from the chronic aseptic me ningitis. The disease is caused by mutations (mostly new dominant) in the NLRP3 gene, which may be mosaic and thus are sometimes only detectable by next generation sequencing.",2014
21329,"Array Comparative Genomic Hybridization has led to the knowledge that some copy number variants (CNVs) correspond to susceptibility loci for developmental disorders. CNVs at chromosomal region 15q11.2 involving 4 known genes, TUBGCP5, CYFIP1, NIPA2 and NIPA1, are of challenging in terpretation due to their presence both in normal populations and in indi viduals with diverse developmental disorders. In a cohort of 1000 patients analyzed by Agilent 180K oligonucleotide array CGH we identified 12 pati ents with 15q11.2 imbalances, 9 deletions and 3 duplications, 7 females and 5 males. Four of the 12 patients had additional genomic imbalances. The patients presented with global developmental delay, dysmorphisms, ID, epi lepsy, mirocephaly, amongst others. To date, we were only able to determine inheritance in 4 patients, 2 deletions maternal in origin, 1 paternal, and a de novo duplication. The proximal breakpoint was common in 11 of the 12 patients, while the distal breakpoint was variable, but similar in some pati ents. The 4 previously mentioned genes were involved in the genomic im balances of all the patients, except in the patient with the distinct proximal breakpoint, where TUBGCP5 gene was in normal copy number. Functional data have revealed that TUBGCP5, CYFIP1 and NIPA1 genes are expressed in developing mammalian brain and are involved in processes such as mi crotubule nucleation, interaction with other proteins and nervous system development and regulation, respectively To date, there is still no straight interpretation when a 15q11.2 genomic imbalance is detected, but in this cohort further evidence was given that this region is associated with neuro psychiatric disorders.",2014
21330,"Due to a high density of segmental duplications, the short arm of chromo some 16 is prone to a number of recurrent rearrangements. A common 600 kb microdeletion or duplication in 16p11.2 has been associated with au tism, intellectual disability, schizophrenia, and mirrored weight and head circumference phenotypes. An adjacent, but separate distal 200 kb region in 16p11.2, which contains the SH2B1 gene, has been associated with isolated obesity as well as developmental delay. Both aberrations are associated with high variability and incomplete penetrance. We now report on two families harboring the 200 kb microdeletion in 16p11.2. Both index patients were initially referred with suspected Sotos syndrome due to tall stature, obesity and developmental delay. After normal NSD1 testing molecular karyotyping showed the 200 kb deletion in 16p11.2 in both patients as well as in patient 2Ã¢ÂÂs brother who had mild obesity and unspecific moderate intellectual disability. In both families the deletion was maternally inherited. Interestingly, patient 2, but not her cognitively more severely affected brother, additionally harbored a microduplication 1q21.1, which has been recurrently associated with variable and incompletely pene trant developmental delay, intellectual disability, behavioural anomalies and large head circumference. Both aberrations were inherited from the mother, who was obese but otherwise healthy and without cognitive problems. The se two families further characterize the variable spectrum of phenotypes associated with the 200 kb microdeletion in 16p11.2. Our findings in family 2 also show that not even the co occurrence of two ID associated microab errations necessarily leads to cognitive impairment.",2014

Seven patients have been described in detail since 2008, and additional cases with only limited clinical information are listed in databases. It becomes evident that not all 17q24.2 q24.3 deletions share a single common region of overlap. We report a 12 year old girl with a normal karyotype who shows clinical features consistent with the syndrome. SNP array analysis revealed a 2.8 Mb long deletion of 17q24.2 q24.3 (chr17:65,281,651 68,017,013; hg19). FISH analysis confirmed the deletion and showed its de novo origin. The deleti on affects 18 protein coding RefSeq genes including PRKAR1A, MAPK2K6, and the ABCA gene cluster. Some of the genes could be candidates for the clinical symptoms and some are predicted to exhibit haploinsufficiency, for instance PRKAR1A, encoding a postsynaptic density protein associated with Carney complex, or BPTF producing a transcript in fetal brain which binds FMRP and encodes a transcriptional regulator. Only much smaller populati on copy number polymorphisms are present in the region. The deletion of our patient overlaps two groups of previously reported deletions. Despite the proximity of the deleted regions, the candidate genes could be distinct. Identification of additional cases will help to define the genes involved and their role in predisposition to neuropsychiatric phenotypes, as well as the emerging genetic heterogeneity within the 17q24.2 q24.3 microdeletion syndrome.

Hypotonia, impaired balance, sensorineural hearing loss, abnormal behaviour as well as mild fingers and toes anomalies are frequently observed. To date, 13 cases, inclu ding 5 from the same family, have been clinically and molecularly characte rized. Here we report on the case of a 14 year old girl with moderate mental retardation, numerous dysmorphic features (a round face with full cheeks, high forehead, ptosis, long and downslanting palpebral fissures, short phil trum, CupidÃ¢ÂÂs bow of the upper lip, down turned corners of the mouth, mi crognathia, high palate, low set and prominent ears, and short neck), short stature and overweight. At birth, microtia of the right ear with external audi tory duct stenosis and atrial septal defect were diagnosed. Muscle tone was unremarkable. Other features comprise small hands with camptodactyly of fifth and second fingers of the opposite hands, unilateral transversal crease, and valgus, flat feet. Auto aggressive behaviour, autism and sleep problems were also noted. Whole genome microarray analysis revealed a 5.19 Mb de letion of 8q21.11q21.13 region encompassing 19 genes. The phenotypic and genetic findings of our patient will be compared with those of previously reported patients. We indicate several candidate genes, providing new data supporting further genotype phenotype studies.

21334,"Background: Five patients with deletions that involving chromosome 8q22.2 q22.3 has been recently reported. Four patients shared a similar cra niofacial phenotype with microcephaly, blepharophimosis, uni or bilateral ptosis and little facial expression. They have moderate to severe intellectual disability (ID) and impairment or absent speech. These carrying an over lapping region deletion of 3.87 Mb (hg19:100.69 104.56). The other patient not showed this facial gestalt but presented moderate ID, and speech impair ment. She presented the shorter deletion of 1.92 Mb (hg19:102.01 103.93). Methods and Results: Here, we described on 18 year old female patient with microcephaly, unilateral ptosis, moderate ID and speech impairment. CytoScan HD array analysis identified a 2.95 Mb 8q22.2 q22.3 deletion. The comparation of the present patient with the above five cases contribute to narrow down the critical region in 8q22.3 of ~1.47 Mb (hg19:101.95 103.42). Furthermore, we analyze the gene functional roles and probability of haploinsufficiency (HI) of this genomic region; resulting the ubiquitin protein ligase E3 component N recognin 5 (UBR5) gene as the best can didate for the phenotype. UBR5 belongs to ubiquitin/proteasome system (UPS). Neurodevelopmental genetic disorders involving alterations in UPS have been described such as Angelman syndrome (UBE3A ), Johanson Bli zard syndrome (UBR1 ) and X linked intellectual disability type Nascimento (UBE2A ). Recently, mutations in ubiquitin protein ligase E3B (UBE3B) in a blepharophimosis ptosis intellectual disability syndrome, which fits Kauf man oculocerebrofacial syndrome have been recognized. Conclusions: We suggested that this novel 8q22.3 microdeletion syndrome had a variable expressivity and proposed that the HI of UBR5 could lead to this peculiar craniofacial phenotype and ID of this novel genomic disorder.",2014

Clinical examination did not reveal significant dysmorphic features, except for frontal bossing and mild hypertelorism. Also her mother presents with mild intellectual disability. Array CGH analysis detected a 493.1 Kb telomeric deletion on chromosome 16p13.3, which was found to be maternally inherited. Further examination of motherÃ¢ÂÂs medical history revealed that she was also affected by microcy tic anemia, which had been treated with oral iron therapy without benefit. The deletion involves the two alpha globin genes (HBA1 and HBA2), explai ning the haematological defect. Deletions of 1.5 and 2 Mb involving the telomeric short arm of chromosome 16 cause the contiguous gene syndrome ATR 16 (MIM #141750) charac terized by alpha thalassemia, mental retardation and variable dysmorphic features (downslanting palpebral Ã¯Â¬Âssures, mild hypertelorism, broad nasal bridge, small ears and a short neck with webbing).

FRAXE is an X linked form of intellectual disability characterized by mild to moderate cognitive impairment, speech delay, hyperactivity, and autistic behavior. The folate sensitive fragile site FRAXE is located in Xq28 appro ximately 600 kb distal to the fragile X syndrome fragile site (FRAXA) and harbors an unstable GCC triplet repeat adjacent to a CpG island in the 5Ã¢ÂÂ UTR (untranslated region) of the AFF2 (FMR2) gene. The disorder results from amplification and methylation of the GCC repeats and consequence silen cing of AFF2. Although chromosome abnormalities (mostly deletions) that disrupt AFF2 have been reported with mild moderate intellectual disability, microduplication of Xq28 that partially involved AFF2 has not been descri bed as a potential cause of FRAXE. We performed clinical and molecular cha racterization of patient with 301 kb interstitial de novo duplication at Xq28 (chrX:147ÃÂ490ÃÂ437 147ÃÂ791ÃÂ737bp)(GRCh37/hg19). This genomic mutati on leads to the duplication of part of 5Ã¢ÂÂ UTR region of the AFF2 (FMR2) gene which could be inactivated due to this genomic change. Namely, duplication of this segment potentially could have the same effects as amplification and methylation of an unstable GCC triplet repeats. ThatÃ¢ÂÂs why we are perfor ming experiments aimed to study genic expression/metilation. As our pati ent had cognitive impairment, speech delay, hyperactivity and mild dysmor phism, we predict that partial duplication of AFF2 in our patient could be the cause of his phenotype.",2014

Neurophenotypes linked to Aristaless related homeobox (ARX) mutations present a huge spectrum of brain diseases including cortical malformations, malignant epilepsy and intellectual disability (ID). We have recently identi fied a crucial disease path, linking functionally ARX to another XLID/Epilepsy gene, Lysine specific demethylase 5C (KDM5C). It encodes an H3K4me2/3 demethylase required in neuronal differentiation. We found that ARX muta tions, affecting PolyAlanine tracts or HD domain, cause functional damages of the ARX KDM5C interaction, which severity depends on the type of al teration. In Arx KO embryonic brain and ES oriented GABAergic neurons, a defective ARX KDM5C H3K4me3 path has been found. We tested in vitro correction of KDM5C H3K4me3 defects, ideally through endogenous physio logical mechanisms. We explored three different approaches: transcription factor targeting, gene knock up by SINEUP non coding RNA technology and epigenetic modifications. To UP regulate transcription, we forced KDM5C transcription by PHF8/ZNF711 stimulation, a transcriptional complex that seems to not synergize with the action of ARX. To UP regulate translation, taken advantage of SINEB2 lncRNAs (SINEUPs) acting as activators of trans lation, we generated synthetic lncRNAs antisense to KDM5C gene. In SINEUP KDM5C transfected neuronal cell lines, we obtained increased levels of en dogenous KDM5C protein. To achieve epigenetic correction of KDM5C path, we screened also a number of compounds targeting chromatin enzymes. A strong compensation of KDM5C down regulation has been obtained at cru cial time point of neuronal commitment upon treatment with an HDAC inhi bitor. Ongoing efforts to define rescue strategies may help to identify useful tools towards drug discovery for ARX XLID/Epilepsy phenotypes and many other disorders with malignant seizure.",2014

The high efficiency could allow the generation of mouse models for diseases caused by dominant de novo mutations.

Consequently, we found that loss of COH1 upon RNAi impairs the ability of the Golgi ribbon to (re)assemble and thus induces fragmentation into mini stacks. Moreover, we found that COH1 regulates the formation of Golgi derived membrane tu bules consistent with its predicted function in intracellular membrane traf fic. Further protein protein interaction studies identified COH1 as a potenti al effector protein of the Golgi associated small GTPase RAB6, emphasizing a role of COH1 for Golgi related vesicle transport. Thus, our accumulated evidence suggests COH1 as a molecular regulator of antero and retrograde Golgi membrane trafficking. As RAB6 associated Golgi transport critically regulates neuronal development and neuron function the Cohen syndrome pathology is likely caused by a failure of intracellular vesicle transport.",2014
21348,"Intellectual disablity (IQ<70) affects up to 3% of the general population. Un til recently, the underlying cause was unclear in about half of the affected individuals. The introduction of whole exome sequencing (WES) techniques enables elucidating the genetic background of ID. We performed WES in a cohort of 250 individuals with unexplained ID and identified heterozygous de novo CTNNB1 mutations in five unrelated indi viduals (three frameshift, one stop, and one splice mutation). All five pati ents have severe motor delay, profound speech impairment, hypotonia of the trunk and hypertonia of the legs. The craniofacial phenotype comprises microcephaly (4/5) and some consistent facial features a broad nasal tip, small alae nasi, long philtrum and thin upper lip vermillion. Beta catenin is a key downstream component of the canonical Wnt signaling pathway, and acts as a negative regulator of centrosome cohesion. Whereas somatic gain of function mutations have already been found in various tu mor types, germline loss of function mutations were suspected in animal models to influence neuronal development and maturation. This was sup ported by the finding of dominant inactivating CTNNB1 mutations as a cau se of ID in 3/865 patients (0.35%, deLigt etal., 2012). Their phenotype was additionally characterized by absent/limited speech, microcephaly and spa sticity with severely impaired walking. Our finding of five individuals in our cohort of 250 (2.0%) suggests that CT NNB1 loss of function mutations might be a more frequent cause of ID than estimated from the data of deLigt and colleagues. Our data further empha size the importance of Wnt signalling in human brain development and/or function.",2014
21349,"Using chromosomal microarray testing we detected a 113 kb de novo out of frame deletion encompassing exons 4 7 of CTNND2 in a patient with bor derline ID. This gene was mapped to the cri du chat syndrome critical regi on in chromosome 5p15.2 and encodes a regulator of neuronal migration. CTNND2 was considered responsible for the severe intellectual disability in cri du chat syndrome patients with terminal deletions. Extended dele tion mapping however indicated that interstitial deletions restricted to the CTNND2 locus produce a milder level of intellectual disability. The girl was born at term with no complication and normal measurements. Apart from 2 episodes of acute subglottic laryngitis there were no remarkable health problems. Developmental milestones were within normal limits. The pati ent was referred to developmental testing because of behavioural issues and was diagnosed with mild intellectual disability. She showed a dissociated cognitive profile with better language than nonverbal functions (full scale IQ 77) and suffered from short attention span, poor executive functioning and impaired working memory. Three other patients with deletions limited to CTNND2 were found in the DECIPHER database. One patient had a 413 kb deletion with mild intellectual disability, autism and hypotonia. The other patient showed a 479 kb deletion with learning difficulties, behavioral pro blems and autism spectrum disorder. In the third patient a 154 kb deletion was detected. He showed intellectual disability and neurological problems which may be caused by an additional unidentified disorder. We assume that CTNND2 haploinsufficiency is a novel cause of mild neurodevelopment fea tures.",2014

In addition, they both present with expressive speech disorder, some facial and hand microanomalies, and poor fine motor skills. Their father has overgrowth (+2.5 SD), prominent facial features and presented with dysarthria in childhood. Therefore, the duplication is with high probability of a paternal origin (analysis in work). This is the smallest Ã¢ÂÂpureÃ¢ÂÂ 15q26 duplication reported so far. Interestingly, the IGF1R gene is not duplicated in our patients. Furthermore, they demonstrate variable clinical phenotype.

21351,"Microdeletion of 6p21 is a rare condition that has been described in pati ents with multiple congenital malformation and intellectual disability. We report on a patient with a 0.4 Mb microdeletion in 6p21.33 and intellectu al disability. The genomic loss contained 30 RefSeq genes ncluding EHMT2 which is a primary enzyme for mono and dimethylation at Lys 9 of histone H3 (H3K9me1/2), and plays critical roles in various biological processes. The 6 year old boy was referred for evaluation of intellectual disability and macrocephaly. He was born at 37 weeks of gestation to a 32 year old G1 P1 mother and 34 year old father after uneventful pregnancy. The birth weight was 2418 g, length 45 cm, and head circumference 33 cm. His psychomotor development was delayed. He achieved head control at 4 months, sitting at 10 months, and walking alone at 2 years. He spoke his first word at 2.5 years. He never had seizures and his hearing was normal. His height was 106 cm ( 1.7 SD), weight 20.3 kg ( 0.3 SD), and head circumference 53.5 cm (+1.4 SD) respectively. Brain MRI at age of 4 years showed incomplete rotation of the bilateral hippocampus. EHMT2 is a human homologue of mouse G9a that exists predominantly as a G9a GLP heteromeric complex.

21352,"We report a Ukrainian family consisted of healthy and non consanguineous parents and two affected children with moderate intellectual disability (ID) and similar psychoneurological symptoms. Biochemical and CGH array in vestigations revealed no genetic abnormalities in children. Whole exome sequencing performed in family members identified two non synonymous variants c.1475G>A and c.1891G>A in the EPHA1 gene. Both affected siblings were compound heterozygotes while father and mother were heterozygous carriers for the c.1891A and c.1475A variants respec tively. C.1475G>A and c.1891G>A frequencies analyses in 300 healthy Ukrai nian controls revealed that the c.1475T allele frequency was 1,2% while the c.1891A was not found. EphA1 belongs to Eph receptors family implicated in axon guidance control but it was not previously associated with ID. To un derstand a possible effect of these substitutions the mutant EphA1 proteinsÃ¢ÂÂ tertiary structures were predicted. As it turned out the substitutions are lo cated in important functional domains of EphA1. The substitution of positive charged Arg492 to uncharged Gln492 (c.1475G>A) is in the fibronectin type III repeat of EphA1 ectodomain involved in signal transduction and binding with ligands or protein partners. The substitution Gly631Arg (c.1891G>A) is in the glycine rich region of EphA1 tyrosine kinase domain responsible for ATP binding. We assume the c.1475G>A and c.1891G>A mutations may cause changes in conformational flexibility and solubility of these EphA1 domains resulting in impaired Eph signal transduction. Predicted structural EphA1 changes and low c.1475A and c.1891A frequen cies allow us to hypothesize that missense mutations in the EPHA1 gene may be responsible for autosomal recessive non syndromic intellectual disability.",2014
21353,"Mental retardation with or without minor dysmorphic features represents a major challenge in clinical genetics. Over a decade ago, the introduction of arrayCGH analysis introduced the concept of reverse genetics in clinical practice identifying recurrent phenotypes in patients with similar molecu lar defects. With the increasing resolution of arrayCGH analysis, monogenic defects can sometimes be readily identified. A careful clinical description of the concurrent phenotype may therefore direct specific gene analyses in pa tients with similar phenotypes (Ã¢ÂÂgestaltÃ¢ÂÂ diagnosis) or may prioritize variant analysis through next generation sequencing of gene panels or exomes. We present three novel patients with FOXP1 mutations. All patients pre sented with moderate to severe intellectual disability with nearly absent speech, patient 3 additionally had tonic clonic seizures, horizontal nystag mus, spastic tetraparesis and aggression. The facial features in these pati ents included a frontal upsweep, a broad forehead, broad and bent palpebral fissures, hypertelorism, a bulbous nasal tip, prominent nasolabial folds and a wide mouth. These striking features and the identification of a de novo 420kb intragenic deletion on arrayCGH analysis in patient 1 enabled us to identify a FOXP1 mutation (p. R525X) by direct sanger sequencing in patient 2 and to prioritize data analysis in a large gene panel analysis for mental disability in patient 3 (p. W508X mutation in FOXP1). We further delineate the clinical phenotype due to FOXP1 mutations. Our and literature data evidence an emerging and recognizable syndrome. In the era of exome/genome analysis the clinical definition of phenotypes remains important to order to enable genotype phenotype correlations.",2014
21354,"Virtually all clinical testing for FXS revolves around the determination of the length of the CGG repeat tract in the 5Ã¢ÂÂUTR of the Fragile X Mental Retarda tion (FMR1) gene. Repeat lengths generally fall into four categories, where <45 CGG repeats is accepted as normal, 45 54 repeats is the intermediate range (gray zone), 55 200 repeats is considered the premutation range, and >200 repeats is a full mutation. Diagnostic testing for FXS has traditionally employed both standard PCR and Southern blot techniques since they provi de distinct, yet overlapping, levels of resolution and complementary pieces of information. However, newer PCR protocols such as TRP PCR have the potential to allow amplification of full mutations, thereby providing a me thod of screening for expansions at the FMR1 locus. The molecular diagno stic laboratory at the Greenwood Genetic Center has offered FXS testing for nearly 25 years. In 2010, we implemented a validated, lab developed FMR1 PCR assay utilizing commercially available TRP PCR reagents (Abbott Mole cular) into our routine diagnostic workflow. Here we summarize our experi ence with the TRP PCR assay, discuss how the implementation of this assay has changed our diagnostic workflow, and compare the hands on time, cost, and turn around time for the samples tested over the past four years to the se statistics for samples tested prior to the implementation of the TRP PCR assay. In conclusion, the implementation of the TRP PCR assay has allowed us to drastically reduce the hands on time, turn around time, and number of Southern blots performed for samples submitted to our laboratory for diagnostic FXS testing.",2014

The estimated incidence of FXS in males in the Spanish population is 1 in 2500 with full mutation and about 1 in 250 with premutation (Fernandez Carvajal et al. 2009). In women, although the prevalence in Spain of premutation has not been established, estimates in other western countries range from approximately 1/150 to 1/250. Given the severity of the disease, its high incidence in the general po pulation, the exclusively maternal expansion, the familial and social impact of the FXS, and the high level of detection of current techniques (99%), we think that screening for FXS in women of reproductive age is a reliable and desirable option. Therefore, we have initiated a pilot study in the Balearic Islands to determine the feasibility and acceptability of prenatal and/or pre conceptional screening in women of childbearing age. The results obtained so far, in a total of 3118 women (252 preconceptional and 2866 prenatal) indicate a high acceptability of testing both, in women that are referred for prenatal or preconceptional consultation. Surprisingly, the incidence of car riers of a premutation (55 200 repeats) is (to date) very high: 1 in 97, which may indicate a higher prevalence than previously thought.

21356,"In a patient with learning disability and behavioral anomalies we identified a de novo duplication of GPM6A by routine chromosomal microarray testing. Glycoprotein M6A (GPM6A) is a neuronal transmembrane protein of the PLP/DM20 family that associates with lipid rafts and promotes filopodia formation. GPM6A variants have not yet been implicated in cognitive im pairment. An increase of membrane protrusions in our patientÃ¢ÂÂs lymphobla stoid cells supports a functional effect of this dosage alteration. To further study the function of GPM6A/m6 and the effects of m6 overexpression and knockdown, we employed Drosophila melanogaster as a model organism. We could show that, as described for other animal models, expression of Droso phila m6 is stress responsive. Using the courtship conditioning paradigm, we demonstrated that correct m6 levels are necessary for proper long term memory function, which indicates dosage sensitivity of m6 and supports a causative role of the GPM6A duplication for the cognitive impairment found in our patient. Defects in the close homolog PLP1 are causative for Pelizae us Merzbacher disease (PMD), a severe demyelinating neurodevelopmental disorder. Prompted by recent results on successful therapy of phenotypes in PMD mice by the administration of a cholesterol enriched diet, we investi gated if the cellular phenotype of GPM6A/m6 dosage alterations could also be improved by cholesterol. Indeed, cholesterol supplementation partially improved the phenotypes observed in patient cells with GPM6A overexpres sion as well as in flies with m6 knockdown. Together with other recent fin dings, these data point to an involvement of cholesterol metabolism in the pathomechanisms of some ID forms.",2014

The host cell factor C1 (HCFC1) gene is located on chro mosome Xq28 and is a member of the host cell factor family. A mutation in HCFC1 has been previously found to be associated with XLID in a non syndromic XLID family namely MRX3. Currently very few studies exist that further confirm HCFC1 as an XLID gene. We present an XLID family with two affected sons having mild intellectual disability epilepsy and no congenital abnormalities. Fragile X analysis and array CGH using a chromosome X exon specific array were performed and revealed normal results. Subsequently, next generation whole exome se quencing analysis for both brothers was performed on Illumina HiSeq 2000 following Agilent SureSelect sample preparation (20x coverage). Reads were aligned using the Burrows Wheeler Aligner and the Genome Analysis Tool Kit. Autosome variants and variants present in dbSNP 135 were filtered out. Analysis of rare X chromosome variants present in both brothers revealed a non synonymous mutation in exon 4 of HCFC1 (p. Ala897Val). This mutation is located within GABP2 and ZBTB17 binding domains. Previous screening studies of patients have reported variants within the GABP2 binding domain p. Gly876Ser in an individual with autism spectrum disorder (Piton et al., 2011) and p.

Trisomy 9p is the fourth most frequent chromo some anomaly in life born and was characterized as a clinically recognizab le syndrome, RethorÃÂ© syndrome. Kleefstra syndrome, previously named 9q subtelomeric deletion syndrome, is either caused by a submicroscopic dele tion in 9q34.3 or an intragenic mutation of EHMT1. We report the first case with 9p duplication and 9q deletion in a Mexican patient. Patient was refer red for dysmorphic facies and congenital heart disease. Clinical examinati on revealed brachycephaly, upslanting palpebral fissures, depressed nasal bridge, anteverted nares, long filtrum, downturned mouth, lingual protrusi on, low set and cupped ears, short neck, small hands with clinodactyly and aberrant palmar creases, left testicle shrink and small feet.

Partial du plication of 9p is one of the most commonly detected autosomal structural abnormalities in live born.

The interpretation of the vast number of missense mu tations in known genes proved to be more challenging, as rarity of variant is insufficient to assign pathogenicity in such a genetically heterogeneous phenotype. Although the cohort consisted of predominantly non syndromic ID cases, the yield of mutations in genes associated with a syndromic phenotype was high, for example, ATRX, CC2D2A, CHD7 and ARID1B.

Frequency and functionality based filtering reduced the number of potential candidate ID genes harbou ring de novo variants to 1 10 per case. In 5 cases, potential disease causing variants were identified in genes previously implicated in ID syndromes: One case was compound heterozygous for two RPGRIP1L rare missense variants, two cases carried a de novo mutation in (an in frame deletion in UBE3A and a missense variant in MLL), one familial case was carrying a rare variant in TCF4 and in the last case a frameshift deletion was identified in SATB2. Two cases were compound heterozygous for two very rare or novel variants in two different potential ID candidate genes, and in the remaining two cases, no candidates were identified.

21367,"Several recent studies focused on the effect of extended homozygosity on highly complex and polygenic traits where recessive inheritance may play an important role. Since excess of homozygosity might increase the risk for disorders like schizophrenia, Alzheimer disease and autism, we have set out a study to investigate the effect of ROHs on the degree of Intellectual Disa bility (ID). About 370 unrelated individuals with ID were collected and clas sified into mild/moderate ID (MM ID) for IQ ranging from 35 40 to 70 75 and severe/profound ID (SP ID) for IQ below 35 40. High density SNP array data were processed with the aim of detecting and analyze ROHs. Since dif ferent array platform were used, homozygosity and ROHs mean length were compared in MM ID vs SP ID separately in each dataset. Results were then combined for a meta analysis. Our data revealed an association between the amount of homozygosity and the degree of ID, according to the recent findings on autism (Gamsiz et al., 2013). Accounting for principal compo nents to control population stratification, we tested for ROHs mean length and detected significantly (p<0.005) longer stretches in SP ID compared to MM ID. Weaker association was detected in burden ROH analysis, showing an increase of the percentage of genome covered by ROHs for SP ID cases. Extent of ROHs seems to contribute to the pathogenesis of ID, suggesting that autosomal recessive variants have a crucial role on the modulation of the severity of ID that still need to be investigated.",2014
21368,"Varying degrees of developmental delay or intellectual disabilities and dys morphic features appear to be strongly associated with deletions involving 5p. Most of these deletions are associated with cri du chat syndrome. These deletions can be terminal, interstitial, or associated with complex chromo somal rearrangements. To establish the genotype phenotype of 5p deletions many efforts had be done in the last years in dissecting the phenotype and three different critical regions had been determined. But there had been controversaries about the relationship between MR and deletions of MRI II encompassing bands 5p13.2p14.3. Deletions limited to this region were reported to show no phenotype, but to aggravate the phenotype in case of accompanying aberrations (Zang X., et al. 2005). We now observed a novel 3 generation family with a interstitial deletion del(5)(p13.2p14.3) limited to MRIII without additional rare CNVs in microarray testing. The index pa tient, a 15 years old girl, showed learning disability (IQ 75), microcephaly, high pitched voice and a subtle facial phenotype. The patients mother and grandmother had the same deletion and likewise the learning disabilities, the high pitched voice and subtle facial features, but no microcephaly. In contrast to the current literature we therefore propose that deletions limi ted to the MRIII region have a mild, but distinct phenotype with particular emphasis on the high pitched voice.",2014
21369,"Around 30 genes are required for glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) bio synthesis. Mutations in many of these are reported to cause a spectrum of neurodevelopmental abnormalities. Here we describe novel mutations in three members of this pathway. Whole genome sequencing was applied to a sporadic patient with severe early onset epilepsy. This approach identified a homozygous PIGQ splice mutation, resulting in exon skipping and defective GPI biosynthesis. Addi tionally, autozygosity mapping and exome sequencing were combined to investigate two consanguineous Pakistani families where multiple affected individuals presented with intellectual disability and microcephaly. In the first family, seizures were present in 2/3 affected individuals. A homozygous p. G92D mutation was detected in PGAP3 that co segregated with disease. Affected individuals had elevated alkaline phosphatase, a marker for de fective GPI biosynthesis. Functional studies using CHO cells confirmed the mutation influenced GPI anchor remodelling. For the second family, the con current release of ENCODE data prompted us to examine UTR variants and a c. 540G>A variant was detected in PIGY which co segregated with disease. Disruption of an SP1 binding motif suggested that the variant might influ ence gene expression. IonTorrent sequencing confirmed that in heterozygo te carriers ~9% of transcripts were expressed from the mutant allele. Our work strengthens the role of the GPI pathway in the pathogenesis of neurodevelopmental abnormalities. Although PIGQ and PIGY both encode subunits of N acetylglucosaminyltransferase, the range of phenotypes seen in the families described recapitulates the pleiotropic effects of defective GPI biosynthesis as a whole. This study also highlights the importance of assessing UTR variants during analysis of exome data.",2014
21370,"Allele drop out (ADO) leads to the preferential amplification of one of two allele due a series of reasons among which the occurrence of sequence mismatch within a primer binding site or a complex DNA motif. The drop out can cause false results during PCR amplification and be responsible of potential pitfall in diagnosis. It is known that genomic DNA sequences can assume different complex secondary structures which can prevent DNA re plication and transcription and, if altered by mutations, may be responsib le of ADO events in PCR amplification. An example of these genomic DNA motifs are repetitive guanine rich sequences, known as G quadruplexes, on one strand and the complementary cytosine rich sequences on the opposite strand, known as i motifs. G quadruplexes and i motifs are present within the coding sequence of the MECP2 gene. Here, we report a case of ADO detected during MECP2 molecular analysis in two unrelated patients with Rett syndrome. In both girls, the mutati ons were in exon 4 of the MECP2 gene (c.1137delC and c.1151_1201del50; c.1163C>T) and were detected as seemingly homozygous. The mutations are located in the MECP2 WW binding domain and fall in a region where a number of small deletions/single point mutations have been reported in literature. Under the assumption of ADO, we have investigated the presence of the wildtype allele with a change in PCR condition and the primers. We prove that the complexity of exon 4 sequence leads to allele amplifica tion failure and that allele drop out is a technical risk in MECP2 molecular analysis.",2014
21371,"We report on standardized brain magnetic reso nance imaging (MRI) data of 30 affected patients, including 5 symptomatic females, carrying a MECP2 duplication, the size of which varied between 228 kb and 11.7 Mb. The aim of this study was to compare brain MRI re sults to seek recurrent malformations and attempt to determine whether variations in imaging features could be explained by differences in the size of the duplications. We showed that 90% of patients had brain MRI abnor malities, and that they shared certain non specific brain malformations such as corpus callosum abnormalities (n,20), ventricular dilatation (n,9), reduced volume of the white matter (WM) (n,12), increased T2 signals in posterior periventricular WM (n,6), and vermis hypoplasia (n,5). The occi pito frontal circumference could be highly variable since it was >+2DS in 5 patient and < 2DS for 4 patients. Among the 9 patients with dilatation of the lateral ventricles, 6 (67%) had a duplication involving L1CAM. The only pa tient harbouring bilateral posterior subependymal nodular heterotopia also carried a FLNA gene duplication. We could not demonstrate a link between periventricular WM hypersignals / delayed myelinisation and duplication of IKBKG. These results show that patients with MECP2 duplications share cer tain common but non specific brain abnormalities. These imaging features, therefore, do not constitute a diagnostic clue.

This double rearrangement has never been described in literature. Our patient presents urogenital birth defects, facial dysmorphism (possibly due to the 9p deletion) and developmental regression, axial hypotonia, Hirsch sprung disease, feeding difficulties, recurrent infections, epilepsy, absence of language, white matter disease (typically related to the Xq28 duplication).

Haplotype analyses showed only 3 of them to be shared with probandÃ¢ÂÂs mother and his motherÃ¢ÂÂs mother. Only one of them, a variant in EIF2S3 gene, is in the region of X chromosome previously described to be associated with MEHMO syn drome. EIF2S3 encodes a ÃÂ³ subunit of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 (eIF2) that is responsible for transporting the initiator Met tRNAiMet to the 40S ribosomal subunit. Point mutations in this gene were previously de scribed in two families with intellectual disability. The variant found in the patient is a frame shift mutation with premature stop codon influencing 8 last amino acids of the protein. In sillico analyses evaluate this change as disease causing.

Brain Magnetic Resonance is normal. EEG shows multifocal spikes and waves. The microduplication extends from gene GGNBP2 to gene SRCIN1 and en compasses 20 genes in 17q12.The neurologic phenotype seems to be associated with gene LHX1. Lhx1 is expressed in the brain and is implicated in Purkinje cell differentiation in the developing cerebellum as well as in migration of motor axon to the limbs. Lhx1 knockout mice shows anencephaly. These data support the hypothesis that LHX1 is a dosage sensitive gene, involved in neurological phenotype of patients with 17q12 microduplication. Additional studies are needed to further delineate the phenotypic impact of expression of this gene.

Due to clinical and genetic heterogeneity, in about 50% of cases an etiologic diagnosis cannot be established. The aim of this study was to evaluate the ability of a combination of MLPA kits to establish the diagnosis in 380 patients with syndromic ID. All patients were assessed for chromosome imbalance using standard karyotype and MLPA analysis using SALSA P064 or P096 kit, if the phenotype was suggestive for a microdeletion syndrome (subgroup A 188 patients), or subtelomeric kits, if the phenotype was not suggestive for a microdeletion syndrome (sub group B Ã¢ÂÂ 192 patients). Abnormal results detected by both MLPA kits were further characterized using appropriate follow up MLPA kits (Telomere Follow up set, P029 B1, P250 B2). In subgroup A we identified 27 patients with microdeletions (14.3%). In subgroup B 8 patients showed an aberrant telomeric signal detected by only one of the two MLPA kits, 31 patients sho wed abnormal results detected by both MLPA kits (~16%), and 153 patients had normal results. In summary, the combined use of MLPA kits led to the diagnosis in 58 out of 380 patients (15.2%). The use of follow up MLPA kits allowed us both to confirm abnormalities and to determine their size, which facilitated the interpretation of the clinical significance of these rearrange ments.

The PACS (phosphofurin acidic cluster sorting) proteins represent a family of multifunctional membrane traffic regulators that mediate organ homeo stasis. Recently, exome sequencing revealed identical de novo mutations in PACS1 in two unrelated individuals with intellectual disability and remar kably similar facial features (Schuurs Hoeijmakers et al. AJHG 2012). Func tional experiments indicated that the mutation exerts a dominant negative effect by affecting the ability of PACS1 to mediate the specification and mi gration of SOX10 positive cells in the neural crest. Here, we describe a third patient carrying the identical heterozygous de novo missense mutation c.607C>T; p. R203W in exon 4 of PACS1 (NM_018026.3). The patient is a 2 year old boy with developmental delay, congenital heart defect (atrio ventricular septal defect), low levels of immunoglobulins and borderline microcephaly. His facial features are strikingly similar to the two patients described by Schuurs Hoeijmakers et al.: He has hypertelorism, long eyelashes, downslanting palpebral fissures, a wide mouth with thin up per lips, downturned corners and a flat philtrum. His ears are low set and rotated. The combination of his features (congenital heart defect, hypotonia, deve lopmental delay, facial dysmorphisms) initially prompted us to analyse the genes of the RAS/MAPK pathway. However, this did not lead to establishing a diagnosis. Finally, exome sequencing revealed the previously described de novo missense mutation in PACS1.

Segregation analysis confirmed the presence of the mutation in his two similarly affected younger mono cygotic twin brothers and their healthy mother with skewed X inactivation (15:75). The mutation could be excluded in the maternal grandfather and both healthy maternal uncles of the patients. De novo mutations in the auto phagy gene WDR45 have been previously described in patients with BPAN (beta propeller protein associated neurodegeneration), a recently esta blished subtype of neurodegeneration with brain iron accumulation (NBIA). Mutations in WDR45 have been associated with an X linked dominant form of NBIA, predominantly affecting females and presumed to be nonviable in males with germline mutations. Similar phenotypes in few reported males and females have been attributed to somatic mosaicism in surviving males and skewing of X inactivation of females. A retrospective evaluation of brain MRI in the index patient at the age of 10 years was not suspicious for iron deposition. Axial MR images (mesencephalon) at the age of 19 years show clear hypointensity of the substantia nigra on T2w images and also on T2*, indicative of pathological iron accumulation.

The majority of patients had whole genome array CGH prior to the selection and we did not include large rearrangements such as MECP2 and FMR1 duplications. We identified 4 rearrangements considered as causative or potentially pathogenic, corresponding to a detection rate of 8%. Two CNVs affected known XLID genes and were therefore considered as causative (IL1RAPL1 and OPHN1 intragenic deletions). Two new CNVs were considered as potentially pathogenic as they affected interesting can didates for ID. The first CNV is a deletion of the first exon of the TRPC5 gene, encoding a cation channel implicated in dendrite growth and patterning, in a child presenting with ID and an autism spectrum disorder (ASD). The se cond CNV is a partial deletion of KLHL15, in a patient suffering from severe ID, epilepsy and anomalies of cortical development.

Current evidence suggests it is involved in neuronal development and maturation, and it has recently been highlighted as potentially playing a key role in the evolution of the human brain. Clinically, NPAS3 has been identified as a candidate gene for schizophrenia, and numerous studies have supported this association. In addition, several cases of learning disabilities in patients with disruptions of this gene are reported, but this association remains relatively unexplored. Here, we present four unrelated individuals with small copy number vari ants (CNVs) within NPAS3: two intragenic duplications and two intragenic deletions. These CNVs range between 111 460kb in length and encompass exonic sequences within the NPAS3 gene. All four patients had variable de grees of developmental delay, and three had subtle distinctive facial features. Two patients also had macrosomia and macrocephaly, while the other two had autistic features and behaviour issues, including psychosis in one indivi dual. In contrast, CNVs involving exonic sequences in NPAS3 have only been seen in one of over 19,000 controls. In summary, these four cases support an association between NPAS3 and developmental delay.

The mouse homologue of another deleted gene, AGTPBP1, is associated with neurodegeneration. Just one literature report exists describing a much more severely affected patient with a slightly larger deletion involving NTRK2. Remarkably, the deletion in our patient corresponds to an inversion described in several un affected individuals.

At age 4 years a seizure disorder started. Notably, at age 8 years, our patient did not yet manifest diabetes, which was of ado lescent onset in the previously described family. In conclusion, our report of a novel patient confirms the phenotype of the novel syndrome associated with biallelic TRMT10A deficiency including short stature and microcephaly with intellectual disability.",2014
21387,"Background: Rett syndrome is a severe X linked dominant neurodevelop mental disorder primarily caused by de novo MECP2 mutations. Clinical features include developmental regression at the age of 6 18 months, ac quired microcephaly, autistic behavior, loss or severe impairment of speech and purposeful hand use, stereotypic hand movements, gait apraxia, and seizures. CDKL5 mutations have been identified in early onset seizure vari ant and FOXG1 mutations in congenital variant of Rett syndrome. We report the results of mutation analysis of these genes in Czech patients with Rett syndrome and mental retardation with Rett like features. Materials and methods: MECP2 was analyzed in 416 patients, CDKL5 was analyzed in 59 patients, and FOXG1 was analyzed in 20 patients. MECP2 and CDKL5 were analyzed by high resolution melting analysis and DNA sequencing. FOXG1 was analyzed by DNA sequencing. Large deletions and duplications were analyzed by MLPA analysis (MRC Holland). Results: Pathogenic mutations in the MECP2 gene in were identified in 45 patients with classic Rett syn drome, 7 patients with atypical Rett syndrome, 11 patients with Rett like features, and 1 patient with autism. CDKL5 mutations were found in 2 pati ents with early onset seizures and Rett like phenotype. No FOXG1 mutation was detected in this study. Conclusions: MECP2 mutations are common in classic Rett syndrome patients, but they are less frequent in atypical or Rett like phenotypes. However, analysis of MECP2 in these patients should not be discouraged. More patients should be examined to determine frequencies of CDKL5 and FOXG1 mutations in Czech Republic.

The study is based on longitudi nal data from the British Isles Rett Syndrome Survey (BIRSS). These 30 wo men have a clinical diagnosis of RTT: 24 women of 40 49 years, five women of 50 59 years and one older woman of 64 years. Tweny nine women were diagnosed with classic RTT and one with atypical RTT (AR). MECP2 mutations were identified in 14 of the 18 women tested. There were six missense mutations; one early truncating; two late truncating; three C terminal deletions and two large deletions. A simplified Smeets severity score was calculated for every decade of the womenÃ¢ÂÂs lives. Little increase in severity was observed and, for most, the severity rating was Ã¢ÂÂmildÃ¢ÂÂ.Factors contributing to disease severity have been assessed. Findings inclu de: (1) severity of phenotype is milder amomg older women, indicating sur vival advantage; (2) depression among middle age RTT may be a substantial but under recognised problem; (3) menopause does not seem to occur ear lier than in other women; (4) nutrition standards from the general popula tion will often be inapplicable; (5) multiple opportunities exist to prevent functional decline through detailed attention to the quality of the medical and social care. There is a particular need to increase awareness of RTT amongst staff caring for older adults with disabilities so that they can identify and meet the needs of their adult patients with RTT .",2014
21389,"RPS6KA3 gene is responsible of Coffin Lowry Syndrome, but recent studies have demonstrated that microduplication of this gene can cause nonsyn dromic X linked ID, ADHD and localization related epilepsy. The RPS6KA3 gene encodes a member of the ribosomal S6 kinase family. RSK proteins are activated by MAPK proteins in response to growth factors, polypeptide hor mones, and neurotransmitters. RSKs appear to have important roles in cell cycle progression, differentiation, and survival. Further studies have eviden ced that the presence of a small amount of residual enzymatic activity may be sufficient to maintain normal osteoblast differentiation and has also been linked to cognitive performance, with higher level of intellectual function. Our case describes a brother and a sister affected by intellectual disabili ties, language delay and behavioural difficulties, with more severe clinical manifestations in the affected male. Both show some dysmorphic features as very large and long nose, mild hypotelorism and dental crowding. The boy performed some instrumental exams as cerebral NMR and CT , which didnÃ¢ÂÂt reveal any major cerebral malformation, but showed an absent pneu matisation of the sphenoid sinus, moreover no other skeletal abnormalities were found. No seizures were reported, except during pharmacological sleeping EEG, some low waves in the right frontal area were identified. The boy had previously performed some molecular exam as FMR1 and COH1 mutation screening and karyotype, all normal. We performed high density SNPs array analysis, which revealed a 512 Kb microduplication on Xp22.12 (19.842.599 20.355.406) in both brother and sister. The duplication was in herited from the mother who is completely asymptomatic.",2014
21390,"Schizophrenia is a chronic disease characterized by cognitive impairment. Biological bases of cognitive deficits are still poorly understood and may lie in insults in the neurodevelopmental process. Synapses structural proteins are claimed to have an ethiopathogenic role in schizophrenia and a more direct effect on core cognitive functions.

Based on this rationa le, we analyzed three common genetic variants of Adducins, ADD1 G1532T (rs4961), ADD2 C1797T (rs4984) and ADD3 IVS11+386A>G (rs3731566) in a sample of 342 patients with schizophrenia, assessed with a broad battery evaluating core cognitive domains that are typically impaired in schizophre nia. The analysis showed significant effects of ADD1 genotype on executive function (p<.025)and of ADD2 genotype on several domains: working me mory (p<.003), verbal fluency (p<.018), verbal memory (p<.001), abstract reasoning (p<.009), cognitive flexibility (p<.02570) and sustained attention (p<.010). Moreover an interaction effect of ADD1 and ADD3 genotypes was observed on symbol coding (p<.029) and verbal memory (p<.027). Our fin dings suggest that genes involved in synaptic building and plasticity, such as Adducins, may have a key role in cognitive impairment in schizophrenia and may help us to better understand the ethiopathogenesis of the disease.",2014
21391,"Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASDs) comprise a range of early onset neuro developmental conditions of varying severity, with or without Intellectual Disability (ID), characterized by impairments in relatedness and communi cation, accompanied by restricted interests and repetitive stereotyped be haviors. SHANK3 haploinsufficiency implicated in Phelan McDermid 22q13 microdeletion is one of the more prevalent monogenic causes of ASD, ex plaining at least 0,5% of cases, but the indication of SHANK3 sequencing in patients with ASD and ID remain difficult. Here we report on two patients with de novo SHANK3 mutations identified by next generation sequencing (NGS). Patient 1, aged 15, was part of a cohort of 40 patients screened by exome sequencing for undiagnosed severe ID, and a truncating mutation was identified in SHANK3 (c.4381C>T ; p. Gln1461*). Patient 2, aged 10, was part of a cohort of 106 patients with ID screened by targeted NGS of 220 ID genes, and a causative heterozygous truncating mutation of SHANK3 was identified (c.2955_2970dup;p. Pro992Argfs*325). They both had normal measurements, severe ID, developmental and speech delay with acquisition of a few words and secondary regression with absence of speech, attention deficit and behavioral disorders necessitating treatment, autistic traits, in somnia and tantrum. Patient 1 had eating and digestive difficulties, patient 2 had distal spasticity, epilepsy from age 5, and facial dysmorphic features. These two clinical presentations appear nonspecific within the ASD ID spectrum. After reviewed the other patients with SHANK3 mutations, we argue that NGS will be helpful to determine patients with SHANK3 mutations in the absence of clear distinctive clinical features.",2014
21392,"Background: Pitt Hopkins syndrome (PTHS) combines severe intellectual disability (ID), hyperventilation, and a characteristic facial gestalt. The di sease causing gene TCF4 encodes a basic helix loop helix (bHLH) transcrip tion factor. Patients carry de novo TCF4 deletions, truncating mutations, or missense mutations located chiefly in the bHLH domain. Variants that do not fall into one of these categories are difficult to interpret. We describe a comprehensive mRNA analysis method for assessing TCF4 variants of uncertain significance (VUS). Methods and Results: Using leukocytes from patients and minigene assays, we documented impaired splicing for the syn onymous variant c.1071A>G p.(Ala357Ala), and for the only two missense variants outside the bHLH domain that are described to date, c.1073G>T p.(Gly358Val) and c.1604A>G p.(Asp535Gly). All assessed variants result in aberrant splicing and premature termination codons (PTC). Conclusions: All TCF4 mutations reported so far in PHTS are either missense mutations lo cated in the b HLH domain or result in a PTC. Splicing tests ought to be per formed in patients with de novo TCF4 VUS, especially missense mutations lying outside the bHLH specifying domain, even in the absence of in silico prediction for a splicing defect.",2014
21393,"Trichothiodystrophy (TTD) describes a group of rare autosomal recessive disorders that variably affect a wide range of organs derived from the neu roectoderm. The key diagnostic feature is sparse, brittle, sulphur deficient hair that has a Ã¢ÂÂtiger tailÃ¢ÂÂ banding pattern under polarizing light microsco py. At the molecular level, TTD genes have a role in DNA damage repair pa thways. We describe two male cousins affected by TTD with microcephaly, profound intellectual disability, sparse hair, aged appearance, short stature, facial dys morphism, seizures, immunoglobulin deficiency, multiple endocrine abnor malities, cerebellar hypoplasia and partial absence of the corpus callosum and absence of photosensitivity. Mutations in known TTD genes were ruled out. Obligate female carriers showed 100% skewed X chromosome inacti vation suggesting a potentially X linked disorder. Linkage analysis localised the disease allele to a 7.75 Mb interval from Xq23 q25. Sanger sequen cing of 737 X chromosome, Vega genes and whole exome sequencing was used to identify a nonsense mutation in the highly conserved RNF113A gene (c.901 C>T , p. Gln301*) ruling out other possible X linked variants. The mutation segregated with the disease in the family and was not observed in over 10,000 control X chromosomes from public and in house data. The mutation markedly reduced RNF113A protein expression in extracts from lymphoblastoid cell lines derived from the affected individuals. Knockdown of orthologs of RNF113A in model organisms strongly support a role for the gene in DNA repair and neurogenesis. The association of RNF113A mutation with TTD identifies a new locus for these disorders on the X chromosome.",2014
21394,"UBE3A gene maps on 15q11q13 chromosome and encodes for the pro tein E6AP , an Ubiquitine ligase involved in protein degradation process. The gene is maternally imprinted in central nervous system and different studies show that loss of expressed copy causes Angelman Sydrome (AS) while the duplication of 15q11q13 represents the genetic cause in 1 3% of autistic patients (dup15 Autism). Using 2 cohorts of AS and dup15 autism patients, we applied induced Pluripotent Stem cells (iPSCs) technology and neuronal differentiation to identify molecular targets of a dys regulated dosage of UBE3A. To generate iPSCs we used 4 canonical factors identified by Yamanaka (c Myc, Klf 4, Oct3/4 e Sox2) through retroviral or lentiviral vectors. We performed 14 attempts and in 13 we generated cells that we defined as Ã¢ÂÂpartially reprogrammedÃ¢ÂÂ because they lost their typical fibro blasts morphology, but died after passaging. In the last experiment we used a commercial lentiviral vector with the same 4 pluripotency factors making a dup15 hiPSCs cell line positive to pluripotent expression markers; further characterizations are still ongoing. Once we have hiPSCs we will proceed with neuronal differentiantion. With our experiments we confirm that the hiPSCs genesis is a stochastic process with a successful rate of 0.1 2% and that no standard protocol exists. In the other hand this new challenging and arduous technology give to the scientists the possibility to understand the pathogenetic mechanisms in tissues that for obviously reasons are difficult to study.",2014
21395,"Array Comparative Genomic Hybridization (array CGH) has increased the diagnostic yield in patients with intellectual disability (ID), autism spectrum disorders and multiple congenital anomalies due to its improved resolution. X chromosome has been focus of attention due to the bias in the affected male to female ratio and to the knowledge of X linked genes associated with ID. With array CGH we can either detect single gene imbalances, chromoso mal region imbalances and even aneuploidies. In a cohort of 1000 patients studied by Agilent 180K oligonucleotide array CGH we have detected sever al X chromosome imbalances. Single gene deletions involving ZNF41 or IL1 RAPL1 genes were equitably observed in 8 patients; DMD imbalances in 3 females and SHOX gene duplications in 1 female and 9 males. We also detec ted an intragenic deletion in SLC9A6 gene associated with Christianson syn drome that segregated in the family. In 6 patients we identified Xp22.31 du plications, 3 females, 1 male with maternal inheritance and 2 males whose inheritance was not yet determined. We identified chromosome Xq27.1q28 interstitial duplications in 2 males, 1 maternally inherited and the other not yet determined. We also found other genomic imbalances but in single ca ses: a complex rearrangement with multiple imbalances at Xp22.33p22.2 in a male patient, maternally inherited; an Xp11.3p11.23 duplication in a female with ID whose mother is also affected and a case of triple X in an au tistic female. The challenge with X chromosome imbalances is to interpret their impact on the phenotype, due to the presence of some alterations in the normal population and to X chromosome inactivation in females.",2014
21396,"We report on two unrelated and sporadic patients presenting a novel syn dromic XLID featuring macrocephaly, severe elocution disability with open bite, high arched palate, malar hypoplasia, a thin nasal bridge with deviated nasal septum, slender build, and scoliosis. Brain MRI showed a thick cor pus callosum. High throughput sequencing identified two distinct mutati ons (c.1131G>A and c.1394dup, p. Asn466Lysfs*13) in the P54NRB/NONO X linked gene. P54NRB/NONO belongs to the DBHS (Drosophila Behaviour Human Splicing) protein family. In mammals three members belong to this family: P54NRB/NONO, PSPC1, and PSF/SFPQ. DBHS proteins are multi functional nuclear proteins implicated in multiple aspects of RNA produc tion and processing. Beyond RNA production, they also play a role in RNA surveillance (binding and retaining hyper edited RNA in the subnuclear bo dies named paraspeckles), as well as in the control of mammalian circadian rhythms. Finally, PSF and P54NRB have also been implicated in dendritic RNA transport. We demonstrated that both mutations lead to complete absence of the P54NRB/NONO protein and overexpression of the two other DBHS prote ins. In patientsÃ¢ÂÂ cells, whole transcriptome analysis revealed severe gene ex pression deregulation, and reporter assays showed reduced circadian clock amplitude. Finally, CT scans analysis of P54nrb/Nono deficient mice demon strate a dramatic flattened nose phenotype that may mimic the severe malar hypoplasia observed in patients. These findings demonstrate the existence of a recognizable XLID syndrome due to mutations in P54NRB/NONO, and highlight the crucial role of DBHS proteins in brain development and function.",2014
21397,"The X linked intellectual disability (XLID) is a common, clinically complex and genetically heterogeneous disease arising from mutations in genes along the X chromosome. Approximately 5 10% of XLID cases in males are due to the presence of copy number variations (CNV). The array based comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) using NimbleGen custom assays (720K) dedicated for X chromosome was performed for 45 patients with the family history suggesting X linked intellectual disability, excluded mutation in FMR1 and ARX genes and normal results in MRX MLPA test. In 7 out of 45 patients (15.5%) the molecular defect was identified. In one patient, the 363 kb microduplication (hg: 73,899,064 74,262,928) encompassing KIAA2022 gene was found. According to DECIPHER CNVs database, reported micro duplication KIAA2022 gene, could be associated with XLID. The duplication was identified in a male patient with moderate intellectual disability that was also present in his four male relatives (brother, motherÃ¢ÂÂs 2 brothers and son of motherÃ¢ÂÂs sister). The female relatives of the patient were unaffected that supports the X linked recessive inheritance. The KIAA2022 protein, also known as XPN, is related to neurite extension and regulation of the cell cell, cell matrix adhesion and migration. The copy number variations and point mutations in the KIAA2022 gene have been recently found to be causa tive for intellectual disability. Therefore, we postulate that the found variant involving KIAA2022 gene can be pathogenic and related to clinical features observed in our patient with XLID.",2014
21398,"Intellectual disability (ID) is a very heterogeneous disorder and the etiology remains unknown in about 50% of cases. Traditionally, X linked ID (XLID) studies focused on males from XLID families due to the hemizygous state of the X chromosome. Females can be carrier of the mutation but are gene rally not affected due to inactivation of the mutant X chromosome in most of their cells (skewing). Previously we identified two female patients with RETT like phenotypes caused by a de novo microduplication at Xq18, in cluding MECP2. While carrier females of MECP2 duplications are generally unaffected due to skewing of X inactivation, these 2 females show complete inactivation of the apparently normal X chromosome. By exome sequencing, we identified a mutation in ATRX located on the other X, which might have caused the skewing in that patient forcing the MECP2 duplication to be ex pressed. Since this two hit mechanism could also occur in other female ID patients with skewed X inactivation, we analyzed the X inactivation pattern of 147 ID females, which revealed a higher percentage (6.8%) of extreme skewing (Ã¢ÂÂ¥ 90% skewing) than reported in the general population (4.0%). X chromosome array CGH analysis of these skewed females revealed two de novo aberrations on Xp11 that could explain their ID phenotypes. Exome sequencing revealed a further two promising variants. Our data thus de monstrate that skewing can be used to screen for (novel) genetic mutations resulting in XLID in females.",2014

ESHG. ORG 164Back to inde x at this locus. Submicroscopic duplication of Xp22.31 has been reported as either a possible cause of neurobehavioral phenotypes or a benign variant. Recently, two large cohorts of patients with the microduplication at Xp22.31 were reported. The size of the Xp22.31 duplication varied between 149 kb and 1.9 Mb and mostly included the steroid sulfatase (STS) gene. Patients with Xp22.31 recurrent duplications generally presented with a neuroco gnitive and behavioral phenotype, including developmental delay. The STS gene could be a candidate gene contributing to the abnormal phenotype in Xp22.31 duplication. Here we report 2 boys with the microduplication of Xp22.31 found by MLPA analysis. The duplication was minimum 246,2 kb in size and included STS and HDHD1A genes. Both of them presented with mild to moderate intel lectual disability/developmental delay mainly affecting speak ability, beha vioural abnormalities and minor facial dysmorphisms. Proband B also had a hypotonia. The mother of proband A, carrying the same duplication, had a mild intellectual disability. Our cases overlap with those previously described in most clinical features. Although there is no clear evidence to support pathogenicity of the Xp22.31 duplication, there is still enough evidence to consider the Xp22.31 duplicati on as a risk or modifier factor for intellectual disability and behavioural pro blems. We hope that the description of these two cases will contribute to the phenotype delineation and elucidation of the role of Xp22.31 duplication.",2014

The duplicated region (9.4 Mb) contains numerous genes and the authors pointed out the possible role of an increased dosage of specific genes focusing on their presumed role in developmental delay and autism. Subsequent reports (Prontera et al. 2012; Wentz et al. 2013) described 4 more patients with a variable association of severe global developmental delay, microcephaly, dysmorphism and autism spectrum disorder, all car rying a duplication in the Xq12 q13.3 region, supporting the existence of a clinically recognizable X linked recessive disorder. We describe a further patient affected by global developmental delay, epilepsy, autistic traits and carrying two non contiguous duplications detected by array CGH, involving Xq12 and Xq13 regions. Detailed clinical description is provided and com pared to previous reported cases. Due to the narrowed size of the duplicated regions (123 Kb and 509 Kb, respectively), this case helps to redefine the region of interest for this condition. The two duplications in our patients involve 13 genes, and 7 of them are mainly expressed in the nervous sy stem (OPHN1, SNX12, MED12, NLGN3, GJB1, ZMYM3, TAF1) and all, except for SNX12, are involved in the pathogenesis of a known human disease.

Methods Targeted resequencing of YY1 and further exome sequencing stu dies in a cohort of patients with unexplained ID were performed. Detailed phenotype information of patients with mutations in YY1 was compared. Results We identified three additional patients with de novo mutations in YY1 (two missense and one nonsense mutation). The four mutations all occurred in the region containing the zinc finger domains of YY1, which is involved in DNA binding. All four patients had ID, intrauterine growth retar dation and similar facial dysmorphism, including facial asymmetry, broad forehead, full upper eyelids, flat malar region, full nasal tip, thick alae nasi and a Gingko leaf like shape of the upper lip.

Different genes were predicted as candidate genes for the microcephaly (AKT3), abnormalities of the corpus callosum (ZBTB18), and seizure (FAM36A, C1orf199, HNRNPU). Recently, a mutation in the ZBTB18 gene was identified in a patient with ID and further signs of the 1q43q44 microdeletion syndrome. Knock out mice with loss of Znf238 die at birth with neocortical defects but a brain specific knock out of this gene in mice causes microcephaly, reduced thickness of the cortex and agenesis of the corpus callosum. The ZBTB18 gene acts as a transcriptional repressor of key neurogenic genes such as NeuroG2 and NeuroD1 or ID2 and ID3. Here, we describe two patients carrying de novo mutations in ZBTB18, one patient with a missense mutation (p. R495G) and a further patient with a nonsense mutation (p. E286X). The first patient, a 23 years old woman, demonstrated a non syndromic ID with mild facial dysmorphic signs. The other patient, a 7 years old boy, showed ID, facial abnormalities, significant speech and mo tor developmental delay. In both patients normal karyotypes (550 bands), array CGH results and normal FMR1 gene analyses were shown. Our results indicated that ZBTB18 is responsible for neurogenic development and mu tations within ZBTB18 cause ID with variable phenotypic abnormalities.

Many tools have been proposed in order to facilitate their interpretation including linking data to several genome browsers, gene contains and prioritization, inheritance of the copy number variation (CNV) and the size of the variant. Indeed, large CNV (>500 kb) are supposed to be strongly associated with morbid consequences.

AIM: Our aim was to evaluate the diagnostic yield/clinical utility of aCGH in the group of children with neurological disorders at Clinical institute of Medical Genetics Ljubljana, tested in 2012 2013. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We included 244 children, 91 with DD and/or dysmorphic features, 44 with epilepsy, 34 with autism, 45 with develop mental abnormalities of the CNS, and 30 with abnormal muscle tone. DNA was hybridized to Agilent 180K or 60K Human CGH microarrays. Discove red genomic imbalances were interpreted according to the data in Internet databases (ISCA, DECIPHER, ECARUCA) and scientific publications cited in PubMed. RESULTS: Altogether, 37 pathogenic copy number variations (CNVs) were found that could explain the phenotype of patients (Table 1). In addition, 26 variants of unknown significance (VUS) were detected, most of them de novo. Eleven patients (4,5%) had complex CNVs.

21407,"Background: Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a complex neurodege nerative disease characterised by progressive degeneration and loss of up per and lower motor neurons in the cerebral cortex, brainstem and spinal cord leading to death due to respiratory failure within 2 5 years from on set. The most common genes involved in the disease process are SOD1 , FUS, TARDBP and C9ORF72. Patients and methods: Blood samples from 72 Slovenian ALS patients were collected and the exons of genes of interest were PCR amplified followed by Sanger sequencing on ABI310 Genetic Analyzer. In case of C9ORF72 repeat primed PCR was performed followed by fragment length analysis on ABI310 Genetic Analyzer. Results were analyzed using Gene Scan software. Results: Genotyping of genes SOD1 , FUS, TARDBP and C9ORF72 revealed some changes in the DNA sequence. In SOD1 gene two mutations (V15M and G94C) were detected. Sequencing of FUS and TARDBP genes did not reveal any amino acid changes. Although two substitutions were detected, R522R (G>A) in FUS and L330L (A>G) in TARDBP . The latter was not previously described. In 2 ALS patients we detected expansion of repeats in the first intron of C9ORF72.Conclusions: This study represents first genetic analysis of Slovenian ALS patients.

AlzheimerÃ¢ÂÂs disease (AD) is a multifactorial neurological condition asso ciated with a genetic profile that is still not completely understood. In this study, using a whole gene microarray approach, we investigated age de pendent gene expression profile changes occurring in the hippocampus of young and old transgenic AD (3xTg AD) and wild type (WT) mice. The aim of the study was to assess similarities between aging and AD related modi fications of gene expression and investigate possible interactions between the two processes. Global gene expression profiles of hippocampal tissue obtained from 3xTg AD and WT mice at 3 and 12 months of age (m.o.a.) were analyzed by hier archical clustering. Interaction among transcripts was then studied with the Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) software, a tool that discloses functional networks and/or pathways associated with sets of specific genes of inte rest. Cluster analysis revealed the selective presence of hundreds of upregulated and downregulated transcripts. Functional analysis showed transcript in volvement mainly in neuronal death and autophagy, mitochondrial functio ning, intracellular calcium homeostasis, inflammatory response, dendritic spine formation, modulation of synaptic functioning, and cognitive decline. Thus, over expression of AD related genes (such as mutant APP , PS1, and tau, the three genes that characterize our model) appears to favor modi fications of additional genes that are involved in AD development and pro gression. The study also showed overlapping changes in 3xTg AD at 3 m.o.a. and WT mice at 12 m.o.a., thereby suggesting altered expression of aging related ge nes that occurs earlier in 3xTg AD mice.",2014
21409,"AlzheimerÃ¢ÂÂs disease (AD) is characterized by the presence of ÃÂ² amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles of hyperphosphorylated Tau. CDK5 ki nase has a key role in abnormal phosphorylation of Tau and ÃÂ² Amyloid Pre cursor Protein (APP). CDK5 is activated by p35, encoded by CDK5R1, whose expression can be modulated by miR 103/107, members of the miR 15/107 group, a family of microRNAs involved in AD pathogenesis. In our study, we observed a significant reduction of p35 levels in cells trans fected with miR 103/107, 15a and 16 precursors compared to control, while the transfection with antisense LNA molecules for miR 15/107 group leads to increased CDK5R1 transcript and p35 levels, suggesting the action of the whole miR 15/107 family on CDK5R1 expression. We thus hypothesize that reduced levels of miR 15/107 in AD can lead to Tau and APP hyperphosphorylation via upregulation of p35 levels and con sequent enhanced CDK5 activity. In order to test this hypothesis, we are stu dying CDK5R1 and miR 15/107 expression and the CDK5 activity on Tau and APP in frozen brain tissues (hippocampus, temporal cortex and cere bellum) from 12 AD patients and 7 control individuals. In the temporal cor tex and hippocampus most miRNAs are downregulated in AD compared to control samples, while in the cerebellum all miRNAs show a similar expres sion between AD patients and controls, with the exception of miR 107 and miR 15a which are more expressed in AD patients.

While amyloid beta protein (AÃÂ²) has been implicated in development of AlzheimerÃ¢ÂÂs disease, the exact functional role of amyloid precursor prote in (APP) is still unclear. In our study, neuromuscular junction of transgenic Drosophila melanogaster lines was used as a model to analyze changes in presynaptic function caused by APP overexpression. Miniature excitatory junction potentials (mEJPs) were recorded intracellularly from muscles 6 and 7 in third instar larvae at room temperature in HL3 solution. Confo cal microscopy with cytochemistry was also used. It was observed that the mEJP amplitude distribution in control was bimodal with peaks at 0.46 mV and 0.74 mV; only rare giant mEJPs were observed. Human APP gene ex pression in motor neurons decreased mean mEJPs frequency (p<0.01) from 2.5/s in control up to 1.6/s, while fraction of giant mEJPs (mean amplitu de 1.41 mV) increased up to 29%. In addition, enhanced axon branching and decreased expression of synaptobrevin was observed. Co expression of human APP and ÃÂ² secretase genes (production of AÃÂ² and decrease in APP level) recovered both mean mEJPs frequency and quantity of giant mEJPs to control values. The resting membrane potentials, time course of mEJPs as well as peaks of their amplitudes bimodal distribution never differs signi ficantly from control line. Distributions of mEJPs latencies in all Drosophila lines were best fitted as a mono exponential decay as predicted by the Pois son model.

21411,"Post zygotic mosaic aneuploidy is common in the normal and diseased hu man brain. Somatic chromosomal mosaicism affecting the brain is, probably, the result of disturbances of adult neurogenesis/gliogenesis during the early ontogeny. It was proposed that aneuploidy of the brain is somehow involved in pathogenesis of neurodegenerative brain disorders including AlzheimerÃ¢ÂÂs disease (AD). Here, we have analyzed X chromosome aneuploidy (a feature of aged cell populations) in the brain tissues of females with/without AD. Molecular cytogenetic analyses were performed by multiprobe/quantitative FISH and interphase chromosome specific multicolor banding (ICS MCB) in 10 AD and 10 age/sex matched control samples, scoring 160,000 cells per each sample set. In AD, the mean rate of aneuploidy (2.79%, 95% CI 1.88 3.69) was two times higher than in control (1.32%, 95% CI 0.92 1.71%); P ,0.013 (Mann Whitney U test). An AD sample demonstrated mosaic aneu ploidy (X chromosome loss) confined to the hippocampus in about 10% of cells. More than 75% of cells with X chromosome aneuploidy were NeuN negative (non neuronal cells; glia and, probably microglia). These prelimi nary data indicate that somatic (post zygotic) chromosome instability cau ses large scale genomic variation in a significant proportion of hippocampal cells in AD. In context of a causal relationship between brain aging and AD pathogenesis, our findings suggest that X chromosome aneuploidy can con tribute to both brain aging and neurodegeneration in females with AD. We speculate that mosaic aneuploidy in the brain is a new non heritable genetic factor predisposing to AD.

Background. Despite enormous investigative efforts, the pathological basis for AlzheimerÃ¢ÂÂs disease (AD) remains unclear. It has been suggested that AD is mediated by pathological angiogenesis. Angiogenin is a angiogenic ribo nuclease whose activity is related to its ability in regulating ribosomal RNA (rRNA) transcription [Cronin 2006].

Methods. Genetic analysis of ANG gene was done in a cohort of 509 AD patients and 417 healthy volunteers over 65 years of age using Sanger sequencing of the coding regions. Results. Genetic analy sis showed the presence of a nonsynonymous mutation in heterozygosis in position g.2162012 causing the change of a lysine to a Stop codon (K73X). This new mutation was found in two AD patients (0.48% of the whole AD cohort): patient 1 is a man, 69 years old, with family history of dementia; patient 2 is a woman, 74 years old, with no familiarity for AD or dementia. No mutations were found in control subjects. Discussion and conclusion. This study suggests that ANG gene mutations may be associated with rare cases of AD. Interestingly, the K73X mutation may be specific for AD, since it has not been found in the numerous genetic studies on ALS and PD so far reported, proposing an important specificity mutation disease.",2014
21413,"Idiopathic epilepsy (IE) is a common neurological disease in human and dog. Relatively few risk genes have been identified for common IE to date. We have used dog as an animal model for human focal and generalised epilepsy to identify disease risk genes. The seizure characteristics are similar bet ween the two species and reduced genetic heterogeneity of purebred dogs is advantageous for genetic studies. Recently, we identified a risk locus for IE in the Belgian Shepherd breed on CFA37 in a genome wide association stu dy (GWAs). GWAs meta analysis of 158 cases and 179 controls in three other breeds suggested association to the same locus (p,2.9e 07). To investigate this locus further, we performed targeted next generation sequencing at the locus. Twelve Belgian Shepherd cases and twelve controls were selected for the sequencing based on homozygosity for the risk and non risk haplotypes. Thirty six variants unique for the cases were identified in the sequencing experiment. All variants located in the ADAM23 gene region. Twenty seven variants were selected for validation in 235 cases and 320 controls from four dog breeds. Association analysis yielded a strong signal at the locus (p,5.3e 11). Haplotype analysis suggests a common risk haplotype in all studied breeds. This indicates that there is a common genetic risk factor for epilepsy in several dog breeds. ADAM23 interacts with LGI1 and LGI2, both known causative genes for Mendelian forms of epilepsy, and plays a role in synaptic transmission.

Introduction: Microcephaly can be either isolated with no additional ano malies, or it may coexist with other neurological entities and/or multiple congenital anomalies, known as syndromic microcephaly. Although many syndromic cases can be classified based on the characteristic phenotype, some others require further investigation. Aim: The present study describes the application of high resolution array comparative genomic hybridization (array CGH), as a diagnostic tool for the study of patients with syndromic microcephaly in order to identify clinically relevant copy number variati ons (CNVs). We evaluate the MRI findings with patientsÃ¢ÂÂ clinical profile and the underlying molecular findings. Material and Methods: From a cohort of 210 unrelated patients, who were referred for genetic evaluation due to syndromic microcephaly of unknown etiology, accompanied by at least one further pathological manifestation, 50 undiagnosed cases underwent array CGH analysis. In all cases previous standard karyotype as well as other gene tic tests were negative. High resolution 4x180K and 1x244K Agilent arrays (>170.000 and >236.000 probes respectively, average resolution 8.9Kb) were used in this study. Results: In 32 out of 50 patients (64%) featuring microcephaly among other phenotypic anomalies, array CGH revealed si gnificant aberrations (microdeletions and/or microduplications) ranging in size from 0.015 to 31.6 Mb and encompassing important genes related with syndromic microcephaly. 25/50 patients (50%) had abnormal MRI findings and in 19 of 25, arrays CGH revealed pathogenic CNVs.

21422,"Mitochondrial dysfunction has been implicated in the pathogenesis of se veral neurodegenerative disorders, such as Machado Joseph disease (MJD), a late onset poly Q ataxia that results from an unstable expansion of a CAG tract in the ATXN3 gene. The CAG expansion size is incompletely correlated with the age at onset, highlighting the existence of genetic modifiers. Alt hough the way by which mitochondria is involved in the neurodegenerative cascade is still unknown, mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) haplogroup specific polymorphisms have been associated to other poly Q disorders. To evalu ate whether mtDNA variation contributes to MJD phenotype, namely to age at onset (AO), we determined the mtDNA haplogroups in 113 MJD patients with Azorean ancestry, by sequencing the mtDNA hypervariable region I. The frequency of mtDNA haplogroups in unrelated patients (n,68) was si milar to the one previously described for the general Azorean population. MJD patients classified as haplogroup J present a significantly earlier on set (mean AO of 33 years). Haplogroup W seems to have a protective ef fect, causing a delay in onset (mean AO of 51 years). Although haplogroup J has already been implicated in other neurodegenerative disorders, there are no previous reports of an association between haplogroup W and disea se. In conclusion, our results suggest that mitochondrial single nucleotide polymorphisms defining these haplogroups could modify AO in MJD.

Thirty pathways were found to be dys regulated (log p value False Discovery Rate (FDR) adjusted > 3); amongst these, mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling is observed, with significantly dysregulated expression levels in 211 genes (p value FDR adju sted < 0.05). mTOR has been described as influencing a variety of molecular processes including protein synthesis and autophagy. Moreover, rapamycin, which inhibits the activity of mTOR, is pointed as having neuroprotective effects in several neurodegenerative disorders, mainly by induction of au tophagy. The present results highlight the potential of mTOR inhibitors as potential therapeutic compounds that should be investigated for MJD.",2014
21424,"Chemistry and Biology, University of Salerno, Fisciano (SA), Italy. Autism is a neurodevelopmental disorder showing a striking sex bias with a male:female ratio of 4:1. Despite some genetic variants are causative for autism in about 17% of cases, its etiology is still largely unknown. Increa sing evidences highlight the possible role of environmental factors, such as infections, xenobiotics and drugs in enhancing autism genetic susceptibili ty. Among genetic variants, we focused on the X linked neuroligins that are involved in synaptic plasticity, are mutated in a few number of autistic pa tients, and are hemizygous in males. Hence we analyzed NLGN 3 and NLGN 4X in 52 Italian autistic cases (male:female,4,6:1) and in 31 healthy siblings (male:female,1:1,1) by Sanger sequencing. Among the other variants, in NLGN 4X, we found 2 de novo SNPs and 3 SNPs in non coding regions (1 intronic and 2 in the 3Ã¢ÂÂUTR), giving 2 different haplotypes: one was new and one was already described in a non specific mental retardation Chinese pa tients. In NLGN 3, we found 3 already described intronic SNPs in haplotype block. The 3 haplotypes have statistical significance in autistics comparing to the minor allele frequencies (MAF) from the 1000 Genomes Project CEU. Interestingly, healthy siblings, half of which were female, have a middle sta tistical significance between autistics and MAF CEU. As these SNPs map to non coding regions, they could be involved in the genetic susceptibility to trigging environmental factors (probably lacking in siblings), and, being lo cated on X chromosome, could explain the male prevalence of autism.

21425,"Background: The genetic causes of Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASDs) are heterogeneous and still unknown in the majority of cases. Copy number va riant (CNV) detection is part of routine clinical workup. An interesting para digm for clinical practice is that each rare CNV may account for only a small proportion of variance in ASD at population level but may have large effects in particular families. We aim to evaluate family and patient specific charac teristics that may alter the clinical utility of autism risk variants. Material and methods: The study contains 466 clinically well characterized patients with ASD from 392 families. Individuals were genotyped by either Affyme trix SNP 6.0 array, OGT Oligo array or Illumina Omni2.5 8v1 SNP array. Ge notype data of each platform were preprocessed and normalized by limiting the resolution to 200 Kb and developing customized analysis protocols per platform to detect smaller variants in targeted regions.

21426,"Converging evidence suggests that abnormal immunity is involved in the pathophysiology of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) both in children and adults. Altered immune processes include ongoing neuroinflammation in post mortem brains, elevated pro inflammatory cytokines in cerebrospinal fluid and blood, altered immune cell function, presence of brain specific auto antibodies, and dysregulated immune transcriptome. One strategy to assess whether dysimmunity contributes to ASD pathogenesis or represents a collateral by standing effect is to investigate whether functional SNPs known to influence immune gene expression or function are associated with ASD. We genotyped 484 simplex and 18 multiplex families with an ASD pro band at 34 known functional SNPs located in 26 immune genes involved in all major immune pathways. Statistically significant opposite transmission patterns between ASD and unaffected siblings were evident for rs2243250 (IL4 ) and rs231775 (CTLA4), with the combination of high IL4 expression and low CTLA4 function alleles associated with autism and the opposite alleles overtransmitted to unaffected siblings. Similarly, at rs361525 and rs2430561 , functional SNPs located in the TNFA and IFNG genes, the combi nation of high expression alleles was associated with autism, while the op posite alleles were protective. These results indicate that common variants conferring hyper responsive Th2 (IL4 and CTLA4) and NK (TNFA and IFNG) activation also confer autism vulnerability. Hence previously reported in creases in plasma Th2 cytokine levels and NK cell activation are not mere by standing effects, but are instead part of the pathophysiological cascade resulting in autistic disorder in a sizable subgroup of patients.",2014
21427,"Many behavioral disorders display prominent genetic underpinnings. We have thus introduced array CGH analysis (Agilent, 180K) in our routine cli nical assessment of all autistic and cognitively impaired children, as well as in the presence of high familial loading and/or dysmorphology. Blood samples were collected from 176 families and genetic counselling has al ready been provided to 65 of them. Eight families are multiplex, yielding a total of 81 patients. Proband diagnoses include: 52 autism, 9 cognitive disabilities, 4 developmental delay, 4 generalized dyspraxia, 3 learning disa bilities and 9 other disorders. Patients were divided into 5 classes based on array CGH results: [1] certainly causal CNV, N,12 (15%); [2] probably causal CNV, N,23 (28%); [3] rare variant of uncertain interpretation, N,19 (23%); [4] common variant without causal role, N,20 (25%); [5] negative result, N,7 (9%). Array driven medical diagnostic work up was prescribed to 10 (12,3%) patients and 3 parents, while drug therapies or supplements were prescribed to 4 (7,5%) patients. The diagnostic work up was positive in 3 patients and 1 parent, while therapies were ineffective in 1 case and still pending evaluation in the other three. Array CGH is thus a powerful clinical tool, provided its focus includes the functional role of duplicated or dele ted genes, their presence in neurodevelopmental disorder databases and possible imprinting. Currently the main limitation is the translation of this knowledge into effective drug therapies. Array CGH data will be especially useful when drugs currently undergoing phase II III trials and potentially beneficial to specific subgroups of patients, will become available.",2014

Severe micro cephaly, early onset seizures, profound developmental delay together with band like calcification in brain, simplified gyral pattern and polymicorgyria are the hallmark of the syndrome. In 2010 OÃ¢ÂÂDriscoll et al. attributed BLC to homozygous mutation in occludin (OCLN) gene through a description of 5 families from a worldwide series including an Egyptian one. Since then, a single family was reported associated with extracranial phenotype namely renal involvement due to cortical calcification. Herein we describe eight pa tients derived from six Egyptian Families with BLC. All presented at early life with severe microcephaly, failure to acquired developmental skills, growth arrest and mixed seizures types with predominance of the myoclonic. Pati ents showed a unique calcification pattern; subcortical band, basal ganglia, dentate nucleus and pons. Molecular analysis revealed that two families were linked to known genetic mutations while four families had novel mu tations in OCLN gene. Three of our patients deceased at the end of the first year of life. Interestingly, the single patient with novel mutation in exon 5 had non neurological manifestations including high imperforate anus and genital anomalies. Further, he had the best life performance with fairly con trolled seizures and achieved few skills although no comparable neuroima ging findings were present.

Genome wide association studies (GWAS) of bipolar disorder (BD), a high ly heritable disorder of mood with a lifetime prevalence of approximately 0,5 1% in all populations world wide, have identified several common gene tic risk factors. It is currently unclear, to what extent low frequency and rare variants contribute to disease development. A valid hypothesis seems to be that low frequency and rare variants in coding gene regions have a higher probability to have a functional (deleterious) effect. This subset of human genetic variation might therefore be enriched for disease relevant variants. The Illumina HumanExome arrays make particularly this window of genetic variation accessible for association studies. This array contains 240Ã¢ÂÂ000 rare markers derived from exome sequencing. That array was used to test 1314 bipolar patients (895 from Germany, 419 from Norway) and 2700 controls (2366 / 339). Genotypes were exproted from a single GenomeStudio project to minimize clustering artifacts. Statistical analysis was performed using Cochrane Mantel Hansel test statistics. Clusters for all associated variants were checked by zCall and manually. The two variants with the strongest association to bipolar disorder were found in the gene SYNE2. Interestingly, common variants in another member of the same gene family (SYNE1) had shown genome wide significant association in the discovery step of the first mega analysis of bipolar disorder performed by the international Psychia tric Genomics Consortium (PGC; Sklar et al. 2011). We are currently aiming to follow up this and other strong findings of our analysis in independent samples of bipolar disorder genotyped on the HumanExome array.",2014

Background and Purpose CADASIL, a rare autosomal dominant disorder caused by NOTCH3 mutations, is characterized by vascular smooth musc le and endothelial cells abnormalities, altered vasoreactivity and recurrent lacunar infarcts. Vasomotor function may represent a key factor for disease progression. Tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4), essential cofactor for nitric oxide synthesis in endothelial cells, ameliorates endothelial function. We assessed whether supplementation with sapropterin, a synthetic BH4 analogue, im proves endothelium dependent vasodilation in CADASIL. Methods In a 24 month, multicenter randomized, double blind, placebo controlled trial, CADASIL patients aged 30 65 years were randomly assigned to receive placebo or sapropterin 200 400 mg b.i.d. The primary endpoint was change in the reactive hyperemia index by peripheral arterial tonome try (RH PAT) at 24 months. We also assessed the safety and tolerability of sapropterin. Analysis was done by intention to treat (ITT).Results The ITT population included 61 patients. We found no significant difference between sapropterin (n,32) and placebo (n,29) in the primary endpoint (mean difference in RH PAT changes 0.19 (95% CI 0.18;0.56)). RH PAT increased after 24 months in 37% of patients on sapropterin and 28% on placebo; however, after adjustment for age, sex and clinical charac teristics, improvement was not associated with treatment arm. The pro portion of patients with adverse events was similar on sapropterin and on placebo (50% vs 48.3%); serious adverse events occurred in 6.3% vs 13.8%, respectively. Conclusions Sapropterin was safe and well tolerated at the average dose of 5 mg/kg/day, but did not affect endothelium dependent vasodilation in CADASIL patients.

21432,"CADASIL is an inherited cerebrovascular disease caused by mutations in the NOTCH3 gene, encoding a protein belonging to the Notch receptor family. Notch signalling is involved in a broad spectrum of function, from the cell proliferation to apoptosis. Recently it has been shown that it is expressed in adult human tissues such as peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs) and fibroblasts. Our aim was to evaluate Notch3 protein expression in human fibroblasts from CADASIL patients. We perform the investigation on the fibroblasts from four CADASIL patients and a normal subject. The patients were genetically characterized, and car ried a C174Y, a R332C, a c.341 24_26delAAC, a R61W mutations, respective ly. Fibroblasts were grown in DMEM with 10% FBS, Glutamine, Streptomy cin Penicillin. At 80% of confluence, cells were washed in TBS and fixed on a slide with paraformaldehyde. The slides were treated with a mouse anti Human Notch3 antibody that re cognizes the extracellular domain ECD and a rabbit antibody that recognizes the intracellular domain NICD. Anti mouse and anti rabbit secondary anti bodies revealed the primary antibodies. Different patterns of localization were detected. In cells with mutation R61W an immunoreactive predominance of the intranuclear NOTCH3 NICD, and in cells from patients with R332C mutation an immunoreactive predominance of the N3ECD extracellular NOTCH3 domain was observed when compared both with cells from normal subject, and with the remaining CADASIL cells. The obtained results show that in CADASIL fibroblasts the mutation type is associated with a relative differential localization of Notch3. This likely might be due to alterations in the protein processing.",2014

Typical clinical signs include hypotonia, ataxia, abnormal ocular movements and psychomotor delay/intellectual disability, but phe notypic variability is wide with possible multiorgan involvement. With the exception of few autosomal recessive or X linked conditions, CBCD are frequently sporadic, suggesting that de novo mutations or genomic rear rangements may represent common pathogenetic mechanisms. We analyzed by genomic microarray platforms 83 sporadic CBCD patients, enrolled in a multicentric project focused on studying the genetic causes of CBCD. Eight pathogenic or potentially pathogenic CNVs were detected in 7 patients (8.4%).Further 11 patients, investigated in our Cytogenetic diagnostic lab for in tellectual disability and/or congenital anomalies, have been subsequently included in the CBCD project, since they showed CNVs overlapping to deleti ons/duplications detected in CBCD patients and/or were affected by CBCD.

Congenital Central Hypoventilation Syndrome (CCHS) is a very rare neona tal neurological disorder characterized by abnormal ventilatory response to hypoxia and hypercapnia, owing to failure of autonomic respiratory control: affected children hypoventilate during sleep, with possible very severe neu rological damages. Frameshift mutations (5%) and poly alanine triplet expansions (95%) have been detected in the coding region of the homeobox gene PHOX2B in about 90% of CCHS patients. A correlation between length of the expansion and severity of the respiratory phenotype has been reported. Since some of the mutations alter the sub cellular localisation, the DNA binding affinity and the transcriptional activity of the protein, and that mutated PHOX2B pro teins can interfere with the activity of the wild type protein by sequeste ring it into aggregates, one crucial question concerns the identification of the functional domains of the protein, the role of the poly alanine tract and the effects of its expansion on the general architecture and function of the protein. We have performed a deletion analysis of PHOX2B and identified two nuclear localization signals in the homeodomain, both required for the complete import of the protein in the nucleus, corresponding to residues necessary for the binding to DNA, and partially blocked by the expanded poly alanine tract. By using mammalian two hybrid system we have also demonstrated that PHOX2B can form homo dimers and we are currently in vestigating if the mutations alter the dimerization properties of the protein and the potential contribution to the range of phenotypes and pathogenesis in CCHS patients.",2014

The PHOX2B transcription factor plays a crucial role in autonomic nervous system development. In humans, heterozygous mutations of the PHOX2B gene lead to Congenital Central Hypoventilation Syndrome (CCHS), a rare disorder characterized by a broad variety of symptoms of autonomic ner vous system dysfunction including inadequate control of breathing. The vast majority of patients with CCHS are heterozygous for a poly alanine repeat expansion mutation of a twenty residues poly alanine tract in the C terminus of PHOX2B. Although several lines of evidence support a dominant negative mechanism for PHOX2B mutations in CCHS, the molecular effects of PHOX2B mutant proteins on the transcriptional activity of the wild type protein have not yet been elucidated. One of the targets of PHOX2B is the PHOX2B gene it self, and we have recently demonstrated that mutated PHOX2B variants can actually negatively interfere with the expression of the normal allele. Sin ce in vitro the poly alanine expanded proteins alter the regulation of other three PHOX2B target genes (PHOX2A , DBH , TLX2) in a promoter specific manner and that, in CCHS patients, different PHOX2B mutations may affect different target genes, this highlights the importance of identifying PHOX2B target genes in order to get new insights into the molecular pathogenesis of the disease.

The pathogenicity of the reciprocal microduplications is more uncertain. Even if the recurrent deletion contains several genes, CHRNA7, encoding for the alpha7 subunit of the neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptor, is consi dered the culprit gene in mediating the neurological phenotypes in patients with the 15q13.3 deletion. In order to evaluate the role of CHRNA7 rare variants in ASD susceptibility, we have performed copy number variant (CNV) analysis and mutation scree ning of the coding sequence of CHRNA7 in a sample of 135 ASD individuals from Italy. Rare sequence variation in this gene remains largely unexplored, given the existence of a fusion gene, CHRFAM7A, which includes a partial duplication of exons 5 10 of CHRNA7. Hence, any attempts at sequencing to detect mutations must distinguish between CHRNA7 and CHRFAM7A, ma king next generation sequencing approaches unreliable for this purpose. CNV analysis led to the identification of a CHRNA7 microduplication in a subject with autism and moderate cognitive impaiment. No pathogenic mutations were identified in CHRNA7 coding regions. However, we detec ted rare variants in the proximal promoter region, previously described to functionally reduce transcription. In conclusion, rare sequence variants in CHRNA7 do not significantly contribute to ASD susceptibility, at least in our clinical sample characterized by low frequency of associated medical comorbidity.

The minor allele was significantly over represented in LPs compared to HPs (38% vs. 26%, OR,1.77, P,1.94E 6) suggesting that it contributes to reduced CP .Neither the top SNP nor a SNP in strong linkage disequilibrium have recei ved evidence for association with a cognitive endophenotype through a pre vious GWAS. KCNH8 is expressed in important brain regions and belongs to a family of voltage gated potassium channels that likely are involved in modulating the overall excitability of neurons (Zou et al., 2003). Our study proposes a promising new candidate gene for CP . However, replication in independent samples is necessary to confirm our result.",2014

COL4A1/COL4A2 mutations have been reported in porencephaly and in small vessels cerebral vascular diseases (CVD), often associated with ocu lar, renal and muscular features. We screened three families with a broad spectrum of porencephaly and vascular leukoencephalopathy for COL4A1/COL4A2 mutations. In family LEU 1 TO, three patients on two generation presented with leukoencephalopathy variably associated with retinal, deep and periventricular cerebral haemorrages and aneurysms. One subject pre sented a small periventricular porencephalic lesion. The proband in family LEU 2 TO had a history of congenital glaucoma and cataract, presented a sudden and reversible motor impairment at 14 yrs, followed by progressive gait imbalance in her 30thies. She delivered two newborn severely affected by porencephaly. In the post partum she had an haemorragic stroke. MRI showed parietal haemorrage, diffuse microbleeds, severe leukoencephalo ABSTRACTS POSTERS ESHG 2014 | MILAN, ITALY | WWW. ESHG. ORG 174Back to inde x pathy and aneurisms of intracranial vessels. In family LEU 3 TO two male brothers presented an overlapping clinical picture with history of recurrent haemorragic strokes in the first two decades and a severe leukoencepha lopathy, brain microbleeds and ischemic lacunae at the neuroimages. We identified two novel missense mutations in COL4A1 (c.1249 G>C, p. G417R in LEU 1 TO; c.2662 G>A, p. G888R in LEU 2 TO) by sequence analysis. Both are predicted pathogenic and hit highly conserved Gly residues of the Gly X Y repeat in the collagen triple helical domain. As reported for COL4A1 missense changes in the first third of the gene, mutation p. G417R seems associated with a variant phenotype in which porencephalic lesions are not the major characteristic.

21444,"Background: Cerebral palsy (CP) is an Ã¢ÂÂumbrella termÃ¢ÂÂ for congenital, non progressive motor disability, reflecting multifactorial insults to the develo ping brain. Etiologic factors include perinatal asphyxia, infection, inflamma tion, and stroke. However, in many individuals with CP the pathogenesis is unknown. Copy number variations (CNVs) cause various neurodevelopmen tal conditions. We investigated the prevalence and characteristics of CNVs in individuals with cryptogenic CP .Methods: 52 participants with non progressive pyramidal or extra pyrami dal signs since infancy and no identified etiology were enrolled. Individuals with acquired cause (i.e. stroke) were excluded. Analysis was performed using the Affymetrix HD array. CNVs were classified as: pathogenic CNVs, likely pathogenic, or likely benign. Main outcome measures were: clinically significant (pathogenic and likely pathogenic CNVs) or not significant (likely benign and no CNVs) findings. Results: 40 CNVs were found in 26/52 (51%) participants. Most CNVs were considered clinically significant (11/26 pathogenic and 5/26 likely patho genic vs. 10/26 likely benign) and were not previously reported to cause motor disability (12/16). Most CNVs were de novo. Compared to individuals without clinically insignificant CNVs, individuals with clinically significant CNVs were more likely to have multiple CNVs (p<0.001), dysmorphic fea tures (p,.01) and non motor comorbidities (p,0.03). In 2/16 participants with clinically significant CNVs the phenotype was characteristic for the ge nomic findings (SPAT and KANK1 deletions).Conclusions: Clinically significant CNVs were found in 16/52 (31%) of in dividuals with cryptogenic CP and were often multiple and de novo. We re commend that this useful test be performed in individuals with cryptogenic CP especially in individuals with dysmorphic features and comorbidities.",2014
21445,"Mutations in PRNP that encodes the prion protein are causative for inhe rited Creutzfeldt Jakob disease (CJD). The E200K substitution is the most frequent mutation. Earlier age at death in successive generations has been reported in two clusters, from Israel (Rosenmann et al. Neurology 1999;53(6):1328 9) and Italy (Pocchiari et al. PLoS One 2013;8(4):e60376). No molecular or environmental explanations have been found. The aim was to analyze a possible observational bias in E200K CJD patients from fami lies living in France. Ages at death from 42 parent offspring pairs from 19 families were collected and compared: parents 63.5 years ÃÂ±13.9 (range 43 to 90) offspring 59.8 years ÃÂ±10.4 (25 to 80), indicating a significantly earlier age at death in offspring (p,.015 paired t test). Including ages at last follow up or at death of an unaffected but obligate carrier parent, the difference increased to 9.8 years anticipation p,.004. Considering the large range of ages at death and the intra sib ship variability, the most obvious bias lies in the fact that sibs could develop disease later in life.

We performed whole exome sequencing analysis and identified a novel homo zygous missense mutation (c.812A>C) within the FTO gene in a 9.5 months old girl with dysmorphic facies and developmental delay. She was the first child from the consanguineous parents. She had microcephaly, prominent metopic ridge, coarse face, long philtrum, microretrognathia, prominent al veolar ridge, antevert nostil, and brachydactyly. She follow up until 4 years and 9 months of age and she gained head control at first year of life, sitting 2 years, walking with help at 4.5 years old of age. She could say only three words at 4 years and 9 months. Denver testing at 4 years old of age confir med severe developmental delay (DQ:23). Cranial CT imaging showed pre mature fusion of metopic suture. She also had splenomegaly on abdominal examination and grade 1 esophageal varices on endoscopy.

We identified presumed disease causing mutations in 2 out of 27 patients including one patient with a DYT6 dystonia and one patient carrying a mu tation in SLC2A1. In 7 patients, we identifed so far unknown probable disea se causing variants including mutations in ATP7B, PLA2G6, PARK2, FBCO7, VPS13A and GCDH. This technology enabled the identification of a genetic cause in approximately 7 % of patients in an unselected cohort of dystonia patients in whom the most common genetic form (DYT1) was excluded.

21448,"Exome sequencing was performed on two siblings of a Sardinian family affected by a severe, congenital encephalopathy characterized by microce phalia, polymicrogyria and dystonia. MPS was achieved with the platform HiSeq2000 (Illumina). Quality filtered reads were aligned to the human re ference hg19. SNPs and in/dels were detected using Samtools and BWA soft wares. To obtain a list of candidate genes, the variants were filtered against a set of polymorphisms available in public databases (dbSNP138, 1000Ge nomes, ESP6500) and prioritized with Ingenuity Variant Analysis software. This analysis led us to identify in both siblings an homozygous variant in a gene of the MBT (Malignant Brain Tumor) family, expressed in mamma lian brain. This variation causes a Ser Asn substitution in one of the MBT domains. The MBT domain is a Ã¢ÂÂchromatin readerÃ¢ÂÂ, a protein module that recognizes mono/di methylated lysines on histones tails. The MBT proteins interact with the enzymes that catalyze the histones methylation. This inter action plays a role in the repression of target genes. Although the pathway of the candidate gene is not well characterized, several studies show that its ortholog downregulates genes expressed in the early stages of neuronal development in Drosophila. In a preliminary study in vitro we have found that the protein binds the di methyltransferases SUV4 20H demonstrating its involvement in the process of histone methylation. We speculate that the variant protein in our patients could destabilize the interaction between the MBT domain and the dimethyltransferases, altering the affinity for methylated histones and presumably its repressive proper ties.",2014
21449,"We report a 15 year old girl presenting with generalized epilepsy and intel lectual disability. After normal development in the first two and a half years of life, delayed language development became apparent. At age 3 drop at tacks occurred. Later on the patient developed clonic and clonic tonic seizu res, predominantly at night time. Most remarkably, photosensitivity and a special EEG phenomenon occured. Under the treatment with antiepileptic drugs the patient remained nearly seizure free. Anti convulsive treatment was stopped at the age of 13, leading to aggravation of the EEG only. Asto nishingly, two years later the EEG showed normalization of the paroxyso mal activity triggered by eye opening. We performed next generation se quencing (NGS) for a panel of genes known or suspected to be causative in the pathogenesis of seizures. We identified a heterozygous stop mutati on (c.348C>A, p. Y116*) in SYNGAP1 which was validated using Sanger se quencing. Analysis of the parents suggests that the mutation arose de novo. The gene SYNGAP1 encodes an excitatory synapse specific Ras GTPase and is a major component of the postsynaptic density. It is thought to regulate synaptic strength e.g. by suppressing signaling pathways linked to NMDAR mediated synaptic plasticity. Mutations in SYNGAP1 are known to cause autosomal dominant mental retardation type 5 (MRD5). More recently, the publication of SYNGAP1 mutations in patients with seizures suggested a role in idiopathic generalized epilepsy combined with a variable degree of in tellectual disability including severe speech impairment. Our patient shows additional symptoms, expanding the spectrum of phenotypes for patients with SYNGAP1 mutations.",2014
21450,"Epilepsy is a complex neurological disorder affecting 1% of the worldÃ¢ÂÂs population. Among different forms of epilepsies, idiopathic generalized epilepsies (IGEs) are characterized by generalized seizures in the absence of detectable brain lesions or metabolic abnormalities. Thus, the prima ry etiology for this disorder is believed to be genetic. This study includes a consanguineous family diagnosed with pattern sensitive IGE and aimed to identify novel epilepsy gene(s) to delineate the molecular basis of this intriguing form of IGEs. Physical, neurological, neuroimaging and electro encephalography (EEG) examinations were performed on the subjects re cruited with information on family history. There were two affected siblings having pattern sensitivity in form of absence, myoclonic and generalized tonic clonic seizures. Illumina HumanCytoSNP 12 BeadChip was used in genotyping of affected and five unaffected family members. Genotype data was utilized using easyLinkage Plus interface, where multipoint LOD scores were calculated under the assumption of autosomal recessive inheritance and haplotypes were constructed through GeneHunter. Linkage peak with a LOD score of 3.16 was revealed on Chromosome 22 comprising 113 genes within a 3.72Mb region. To analyze the candidate linkage region and identify any novel epilepsy genes residing outside this region, Illumina HiSeq2000 was used to perform whole exome sequencing on one of the affected sibs. Two genes with homozygous variants were located within the linkage re gion that segregated with the condition. Our study indicated homozygous variations in a gene encoding brain specific, spliceosome component and a gene with an unknown protein function possibly responsible in a family with pattern sensitive IGE.",2014

All 6 affected family members along with 3 unaffected members and the youngest child with trisomy 21 have been genotyped using Illumina 300K SNP array. Linkage analysis was performed utilizing easyLinkagePlus interface under the assumption of autosomal recessive inheritance. Linkage analysis pinpointed a locus on chromosome 21q22.3 with a LOD score of 4.33. CSTB gene which resides within this region was screened for mutati ons in this family via DNA sequencing and long PCR, as mutations in CSTB have been implicated in ULD. This analysis revealed a dodecamer repeat ex pansion of almost 40 copies in the promoter region of CSTB in all affected children. We have also analyzed the genotyping data of the youngest child with Trisomy 21, as CSTB resides on this chromosome. It is not possible to detect the carrier status with conventional PCR techniques, as there are 3 copies of the gene. We have first managed to detect parent of origin for tri somy via analyzing the chromosome 21 genotyping data as a trio. Additional haplotype analysis of three copies of chromosome 21 revealed that this indi vidual, who was under the age of onset at the time of the study, has only one copy of the defective allele and probably will not develop ULD.

All se ven affected individuals developed seizures in the first day of life, resistant to treatment and leading to repetitive Ã¢ÂÂEtat de malÃ¢ÂÂ. Evolution was marked by severe EE with major delay in motor acquisitions and one patient died at 11 years of age. No facial dysmorphism was noted, but oligodontia. Given the similarity in clinical presentation in the two families, we hypothesized that the observed phenotype was due to mutations in the same gene, and performed exome sequencing in three affected individuals. Analysis of rare variants in genes consistent with an autosomal recessive mode of inheri tance led to identification of mutations in a solute carrier gene. Causality was confirmed by co segregation analysis in additional family members. To assess the frequency of alterations of this gene in early onset EE, coding exons were screened for mutations in a cohort of 70 unrelated affected indi viduals by targeted sequencing on a MiSeq instrument (Illumina). This expe riment led to identification of compound heterozygous pathogenic variants in a simplex case with a similar clinical presentation as the other affected patients.

21454,"Fabry disease (FD) is a rare hereditary disease caused by the absence or deficiency of lysosomal enzyme activity of the glycosylase ÃÂ± galactosidase A (GLA, EC 3.2.1.22, ÃÂ± gal A).

A lack of particular hydrolase ac tivity leads to lysosomal glycosphingolipid storage and subsequently multi subcellular dysfunction. Many mutations in the GLA gene have been identi fied compromising the enzymeÃÂ¼s stability causing a premature proteasomal degradation. Therefore, treatment strategies apply the use of small molecule enzyme inhibitors having the ability to promote enzyme folding and trans port intracellularly, the so called pharmacological chaperones (PC). It was demonstrated that those molecules specifically bind to the (mutated) tar get enzyme which leads to a thermodynamically favoured conformational change and in turn further cellular transport and an increase of the required activity in the lysosomes. One such compound is 1 Deoxygalactonojirimy cine (DGJ). We recently described an auxiliary function of Ambroxol (ABX), a PC described for mutant glucocerebrosidase in Gaucher disease, for the observed DGJ activity in over expression based cell culture systems of FD. Here, we report the results of a derivatisation project of Ambroxol and the structural analogue Bromhexine that led to the discovery of compounds that preserved the ability to enhance mutant ÃÂ± gal A activity in combination with DGJ.

To this aim, we used long template PCR to screen the entire GBA coding region for mutations in 216 patients with PD and 84 with LBD. GBA mutations were identified in 24 of 216 PD (11.1%) and in 4 of 84 LBD (4.7%) cases. Fourteen different GBA heterozygous mutations were detected, including two previously un reported mutations (c.1095G>C [p. Glu365Asp]) and a frameshift mutation (c.1197_1198insCTGTA [p. Met400Leufs*2]).In conclusion, we report a high frequency of GBA mutations in Italian pati ents with either PD or LBD, indicating that GBA mutations represent a signi ficant risk factor for these disorders in Italy.",2014
21463,"Mutations in ATP1A3 have been reported in rapid onset dystonia parkin sonism (RDP). Dystonia in RDP has a characteristic sudden onset, typically in adolescence in response to physical or mental stress. Dystonic symptoms usually involve the bulbar region and are accompanied by symptoms of par kinsonism. More recently, mutations in ATP1A3 have been linked to alterna ting hemiplegia of childhood (AHC) and CAPOS syndrome, respectively. We investigated a family with dystonia from New Zealand with ten affec ted members. Interestingly, only females were affected. After exclusion of mutations in TOR1A and THAP1, we performed genome sequencing in two affected cousins. For filtering, we used the KnomeDiscovery Data Filtering Software. Since re sequencing of 20 candidate variants did not elucidate the genetic cause, we performed exome sequencing in another affected indivi dual. Analysis of the raw data using an in house bioinformatics pipeline re vealed a previously unreported three base pair deletion (c.443_445delGAG, p.148_149delSer) in ATP1A3 in all three genome/exome sequenced pati ents. Segregation analysis showed the mutation in all patients and in one unaffected male. The mutation was not found in 200 controls. Subsequent clinical re examination, revealed sudden onset of dystonic symptoms after stressful events. None of the patients reported any history of AHC or CAPOS syndrome. In conclusion, our study identifies a novel mutation in ATP1A3 as cause of RDP and highlights two important challenges when using next generation sequencing: 1) The importance of detailed clinical information. In our family, we have initially missed the characteristic sudden onset. 2) The difficulties with the annotation of deletions/insertions in the used software package.",2014

Friedreich ataxia (FRDA) is a rare autosomal recessive hereditary disorder caused by expansion of a GAA repeats in the first intron of the X25 gene. It typically begins before the age of 25, but up to 25% of patients may be con sidered atypical with respect to the established diagnostic criteria, showing delayed age at onset with mild clinical impairment, slower progression of disease, and fewer secondary complications. These patients are arbitrarily subdivided into late onset FRDA [LOFA; 25 39 years] and very late onset FRDA [VLOFA; Ã¢ÂÂ¥40 years], show retained deep tendon reflexes and unu sually gradual disease progression. Here we describe a 63 year old white woman showing lower limb spasticity with ataxia and preserved ankle and knee jerks. The progression was slowly during the past 6 years, family histo ry was negative for neurological diseases and no consanguinity was repor ted. Cerebellar dysartria, axonal neuropathy and reduced glucose tolerance were also present. Brain NMR showed cerebellar and cortical atrophy. Mole cular analysis revealed a pathologic GAA expansion in the gene encoding frataxin, carrying expanded alleles in the low range size, corresponding to 110 and 180 GAA repeats. VLOFA is an infrequent subtype of the disease with onset ranging between 40 and 67 years. Nevertheless, considering the frequency of FRDA mutations carriers in the general population (1/60), and the associated risk of recurrence, this condition deserve to be considered in atypical ataxic patients, even when the full clinical criteria for a classical form are not satisfied.",2014
21465,"Mutations in REEP1 have classically been associated with a pure form of the neurodegenerative condition hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP type SPG31), i.e. a phenotype resulting from exclusive involvement of upper motoneurons. We recently reported on a unique REEP1 alteration which results in complete skipping of the in frame exon 5 and is associated with distal hereditary motor neuropathy (dHMN type V), i.e. an exclusive lower motoneuron phenotype. Using minigene constructs we found that additio nal exon 5 mutations, apparently representing non sense or silent variants, confer partial missplicing of this exon. Interestingly, these mutations are as sociated with complicated forms of HSP in which both upper and lower mo toneurons seem to be involved. A meta analysis of published reports reveals that lower motoneuron involvement in SPG31 is significantly associated with mutations that truncate the protein after the first ~100 residues. This border co incites with the C terminus of the REEP homology domain which mediates hetero and homomeric interactions. By overexpression we show that such truncated polypeptides resemble the previously reported exon 5 deletion variant in localizing to large peri nuclear Ã¢ÂÂclumpsÃ¢ÂÂ. Moreover, we observed that these structures indeed depend on presence of the REEP ho mology domain, and that their number and size increases over time. This in dicates that they represent aggregates rather than intact cellular structures. We thus suggest that N terminal mutations act via haploinsufficiency which causes pure HSP , while for more C terminal mutations there is an additional, aggregate mediated toxic gain of function effect which results in complex phenotypes due to lower motoneuron involvement.",2014

Hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP) constitutes a heterogeneous group of syndromes with core features of progressive lower limb spasticity and wea kness, without or with other manifestations (pure / complex HSP). All mo des of inheritance have been described. HSP with thin corpus callosum (TCC) represents a distinct entity for which mutations in SPG11 are the most frequent causes. As a part of a larger study to elucidate the molecular basis and the phenoty pic patterns of HSP in Sudan, we report 2 extended Sudanese families with complex HSP and multiple consanguinity loops. Ten patients were clinically phenotyped and DNA was obtained from blood and saliva samples. The age at onset in the first family ranged from 12 to 17 years. Patients pre sented with ataxia, mental impairment and skeletal deformities in addition to spasticity. Exome sequencing performed in 3 patients identified a homo zygous deletion (c.6709del/p. Ala2237Gln*7) in exon 36 of SPG11. In the second family, the age at onset extended from 11 to 24. The phenotype was more complex, with psychiatric symptoms, dysphagia and peripheral motor involvement with distal muscle atrophy of both limbs. Direct sequen cing of SPG11 identified a stop mutation (c.6349G>T/p. Glu2117*) in exon 34 that segregated with the disease within the family. MRI of 3 cases from both families revealed TCC, cerebellar and cortical atro phy and WMLs. Both mutations are novel and lead to premature truncation of spatacsin pro tein. These families are the first described Sudanese families carrying SPG11 mutations. This study illustrates the wide range of clinical presentations as sociated with SPG11.",2014
21467,"Objective: To obtain a proof of concept for an anaplerotic therapy in Hun tington disease (HD) using a validated functional biomarker of brain energy metabolism. Background: Energy deficit has been greatly implicated in the pathophysio logy of HD. Our previous work has indicated a need to refill the Krebs cycle which can be achieved using anaplerotic therapy. Methods: 31P brain magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) was coupled with the activation of the occipital cortex to measure the levels of PCr and Pi before (rest), during (activation) and after (recovery) a visual stimulus. At visit 1, we performed 31P brain MRS in 10 patients at the early stage of HD and 10 controls. HD patients were then treated at home for one month with triheptanoin and came back for a second visit during which we performed 31P brain MRS. Results: At visit 1, we confirmed a significant increase in Pi/PCr ratio (p,0.022) during brain activation in controls reflecting increased ATP syn thesis followed by a significant return to baseline levels during recovery (p,0.008). In HD patients, we confirmed an abnormal brain energy profile with decreased Pi/PCr ratio before treatment. After one month of trihep tanoin therapy, the MRS profile was greatly improved in HD patients with increased Pi/PCr ratio during visual stimulation (p,0.004).Conclusion: This study suggests that triheptanoin is able to correct the bio energetic profile in HD patientsÃ¢ÂÂ brain at an early stage of the disease. The administration of triheptanoin over a longer period of time is now required to assess its clinical benefit.",2014

We observed a si gnificant reduction of PMCA1 protein in glial differentiated mutant cells (p<0.05) and SERCA2 protein in undifferentiated mutant cells (p<0.001). Using doxycicline inducible rat striatal cell lines (Hd19 and HD43 Sipione et al. 2002) we confirmed the reduction of SERCA2 as a mutant huntingtin expression dependent event. To evaluate the role of PMCA1 and SERCA2 gene expression as biomarkers of disease onset or/and progression we compared their mRNA levels in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) of 20 pre symptomatic and 90 symptomatic HD subjects and in sex and age matched healthy subjects. We observed a reduction of SERCA2 mRNA both in pre symptomatic and sym ptomatic HD patients compared with healthy subjects. Our data highlight SERCA2 gene down regulation as a biomarker of HD having a role in early cellular dysfunction. Finally, in PBMC we studied the neuroprotective angiogenic factor vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) mRNA level. VEGF transcript level resul ted significantly lower in pre symptomatic HD compared to healthy subjects (p<0.01) and even lower in late symptomatic compared to pre symptomatic group (p<0.05).

The typical neurological features of pure JS include hypotonia, ataxia, psychomotor de lay, abnormal ocular movements and intellectual impairment. This pheno type may be complicated by defects of the kidneys, eyes, liver, skeleton and orofacial defects, resulting in wide clinical variability. JS is recessively inhe rited and genetically heterogeneous, with 24 known genes. All genes encode for proteins of the primary cilium, and indeed there is clinical and genetic overlap with other ciliopathies. In particular, JS shares 13 genes with Meckel syndrome (MS), a lethal condition characterized by cystic kidneys, bile duct proliferation of the liver, encephalocele and polydactyly. As part of a large screening of ciliopathy genes in 260 JS patients, we identified novel pathoge nic mutations in two genes not previously implicated in this condition. Two patients carried mutations in the MKS1 gene, a 44 year old man with JS and retinal dystrophy, and a two year old child with a pure JS phenotype. Muta tions in the B9D1 gene were identified in two other patients, a 9 year old boy and a 6 year old girl both presenting with pure JS. All identified muta tions were inherited from heterozygous healthy parents, were not reported in public databases, and affected highly conserved residues.

Lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs), obtained through the immortalization of B lymphocytes by Epstein Barr virus, can provide a virtually unlimited sour ce of DNA, mRNA and protein for research studies and have been used as a replacement for molecular and functional analyses of diseases including those affecting central nervous system (CNS). Autosomal dominant adult onset leukodystrophy (ADLD) is a demyelinating disease of the CNS asso ciated with duplication of the lamin B1 gene (LMNB1). Studying LCLs com pared to fibroblasts from a survey of patients affected by ADLD, we showed a wide variability in LMNB1 levels both at mRNA and protein levels. Lamin B1 expression was inversely proportional to miR 23, a known LMNB1 re gulator. Linear regression analysis showed that there was a significant in verse correlation between the mean miR 23 levels and lamin B1 expression in patientsÃ¢ÂÂ LCLs, whereas no correlation was observed in fibroblasts. We speculate that the immortalization of LCLs randomly deregulates miR 23 expression that, in turn, alters lamin B1 levels. This work further demon strates the importance of miR 23 in the regulation of lamin B1 expression, and suggests caution when using LCLs as the only source of mRNA in the contest of in vitro research and of lamin B1 as Western blots loading control for nuclear extracts.",2014
21472,"Leukodystrophy with vanishing white matter (LVWM) is a rare autosomal recessive white matter disease due to mutations in one of the five eukaryo tic initiation factor 2B genes (EIF2B1 5). Onset is typically in late infancy or early childhood, but later onset is also reported. The adult onset form is usually associated with EIF2B5 Arg113His mutation while, thus far, the re are only 3 reports of mutations in EIF2B3. Genetic analysis of EIF2B5 and EIF2B3 genes was performed in 6 adult onset Italian patients from 5 families, for whom LVWM was suggested by MRI pattern. We identified 5 different EIF2B5 missense mutation (2 novel), in 4 patients (2M, 2F) and 2 different EIF2B3 missense mutations (1 novel) in 2 female patients. The clinical presentation of mutated patients is heterogeneous and nonspeci fic, ranging from nearly isolated neurogenic bladder or ovarian failure to stroke like episodes or various psychiatric disturbances. Overall, the clinical course was slowly progressing over years or decades, although rapid mo tor or cognitive deterioration was observed in one case. In all cases, brain MRI was characterized by diffuse leukoencephalopathy associated with a varying burden of areas of rarefaction/cavitation. This study provides further evidence that not only EIF2B5, but also EIF2B3 mutations can be associated with a wide clinical spectrum of adult onset LVWM, whereas the neuroradiological pattern characterized by areas of white matter rarefac tion/cavitation unequivocally guides the clinician to request the proper diagnostic molecular test.

The genotyping data obtained were further analyzed in terms of copy number variation (CNV) and linkage using Illumina proprietary software cnvPartition and ea syLinkagePlus interface, respectively. The patients were negative for a com mon CNV, while a single linkage peak on chromosome 6q25 was obtained with a maximum LOD score of 3.42.Whole exome sequencing (WES) was performed in two affected sibs from the family in parallel to linkage analysis. Genetic variants of the affected individuals within the linkage interval were filtered against novel variants with harmful effect.

Recently, several studies of exonic variants in large populations were published; however, none of them was focused in the 3Ã¢ÂÂUTR region. Our aim was to screening the 3Ã¢ÂÂUTR of LRRK2 looking for risk variants, modifying factors, disrupted targets for microRNA binding and a possible effect of this region in mRNA expression. Our cohort consisted of 743 PD patients (67ÃÂ±10 years; 52% male) and 523 healthy controls (67ÃÂ±12 years; 50% male). The human post mortem tissu es were obtained from three different brain regions of 9 PD and 5 healthy donors.

Background and Objectives: Autophagy, as a process of intracellular compo nents degradation, is especially important in disorders where accumulation of the mutant protein is a hallmark, such as MJD, a late onset polyglutamine ataxia. We documented the variation in the promoter of the BECN1 gene whose overexpression has been reported to exert neuroprotective effects in MJD. The relation between BECN1 promoter variation and expression levels were studied, as well as its impact on disease onset. Methods: The BECN1 promoter was sequenced in 95 MJD patients and 120 controls. In silico analysis (PROMO) were performed to detect differences in putative transcription factor binding sites (TFBS). BECN1 expression level was quantified by Real time PCR in 29 MJD patients and 27 controls, for which cDNA from peripheral blood was available. Results: Two previously described variants (rs60221525 and rs116943570) were found in MJD patients and controls. In silico analysis predicted the existence of less putative TFBS for rs60221525 and of more TFBS for rs116943570. BECN1 expression levels were in agreement with the in silico predictions, showing decreased and increased expression for rs60221525 and rs116943570, respectively. CAG number explained 60.5% of the va riance in onset; when rs60221525 and rs116943570 were added to the multiple regression model, there was a tendency for the increase in the ex planation. Conclusions: Variation found in the BECN1 promoter modulates expression and has a potential to modify onset of MJD.

Estimated heritability is about 37% for MDD and 75% for BD and the two disorders have a genetic correlation of about 43%. As of today their genetic architecture remains unclear and no major gene tic risk factors or causative genes have been identified yet. With the aim of identifying susceptibility loci responsible for the MDD/BD phenotype, we studied a IV generation Italian pedigree composed of 20 subjects, 7 of whom are affected by mood disorders (5 MDD, 2 BD). Linkage analysis identified 5 regions that were inherited by all the affected members, extending for 222 Mb overall. Exome sequencing performed on the 7 affected subjects and 2 unaffected relatives identified ~1930 genetic variants within linkage regi ons, 222 of which are functional variants (missense, LoF, splicing) shared by all affected subjects. These latter variants affect several genes already asso ciated to MDD/BD and other relevant biological pathways, such as synaptic development and neurodevelopment. We also identified 28 rare variants (MAF<1 % in dbSNP , 1000G and ESP6500), 8 in the linkage regions, present only in the affected subjects. Among the genes affected by these variants, we selected 4 candidates that could differentiate affected from unaffected sub jects in the family.

Studies on Mecp2 deficient mouse models have revealed severe neu rotransmission dysregulations, including deficits in bioamine levels and dysfunction of the GABAergic and glutamatergic systems leading to an imba lance between excitation and inhibition in the brain of the mutant animals. However, published results are divergent due to differences in age, model used and/or brain areas studied. Here, we have used real time PCR, western blotting and HPLC dosage to compare the GABA and glutamate metabolism in eight different brain areas of the Mecp2 deficient mouse brain at two de velopmental stages (early and late symptomatic). Several key enzymes of GABA and glutamate metabolism have been studied (Kcc2, Nkcc1, Vglut1/2, Gad1/2). Our results show : 1 a progressive reduction of the GABA and glut amate contents; 2 a spatial and temporal deregulation of the GABAergic and glutamatergic key enzymes.

Intellectual disability (ID) is the core disorder of this syndrome but autistic features such as stereotypic movements and lack of social com munications are commonly reported. To further assess the role of MEF2C in autism spectrum disorder (ASD), we looked for MEF2C point mutations by Sanger sequencing and for MEF2C copy number variations by SNP array in a cohort of 195 patients with ASD and mild to severe ID.

The candidate region contains 120 genes and is characterized by a high number of pseudogenes and paralogs which led to many false positive calls due to multiple mapping reads. No evident mutations were identified in the also poorly covered exons of the linkage region but the prioritization analysis of the about 230 WES va riants within the candidate region pinpointed a novel missense substitution in the SGK223 gene (c.1529T>C). In silico predictions strongly suggested an alteration of a cryptic splice site in presence of this variant. Interestingly, SGK223 codes for the pragmin protein involved in the reorganization of cy toskeleton, which is a pathway already involved in the dHMN pathogenesis. Despite this functional consistency, further studies are warranted to con firm these findings.",2014
21483,"In 1977, Sourander and WÃÂ¥linder described a case of hereditary multi in farct dementia (MID) in a Swedish family. Later their disease was suggested to be cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL). The clinical picture of recurrent stro kes resembles CADASIL, but we did not detect any pathogenic mutations in the entire 8091 bp reading frame of NOTCH3 nor found evidence for the NOTCH3 gene linkage. Neither did we find any evidence of the CADASIL typical granular osmiophilic material (GOM) in skin biopsies. These mul tiple approaches suggest that in this Swedish family the hereditary MID suspected to be CADASIL is a different disorder with dissimilar pathological features, and belongs to the growing group of genetically uncharacterized familial small vessel diseases (SVDs).In order to search for the pathogenic mutation behind the disease, we did a whole exome sequencing for two healthy and three affected family mem bers. The exon targeting was done with NimbleGenÃ¢ÂÂs sequence capture (Roche Inc. USA) and the sequencing with IlluminaÃ¢ÂÂs sequencing platform (Illumina Inc. USA).After sequencing the results were filtered against public SNP databases in order to identify the sequence variants that have not been published pre viously as polymorphisms. Subsequently, we concentrated on the variants that are shared by all the three patients and excluded the variants that are also shared by the healthy controls. Since the disease is dominant we nar rowed our search by excluding the variants that are homozygous in all pati ents. Detailed results of our studies will be presented at the congress.",2014
21484,"Background: The region ch12q14.1 was shown to be associated with seve ral autoimmune diseases in different Genome Wide Association Studies. We have determined that a variant which alters the enhancer activity of a regu latory element explains the association of the locus with multiple sclerosis (MS). This region contains the CYP27B1 gene encoding the enzyme 1 alpha hydroxylase which catalyses the conversion of 25(OH)D to 1,25(OH) 2D, the active form of vitamin D. Since the vitamin D is a key regulator of the immu ne response and plays a role in MS susceptibility, we want to determine the effect of the variant on the expression of the CYP27B1 gene in specific popu lation of immune cells. Methods : The monocytes CD14 cells were purified from 111 healthy individuals. They were activated with Interferon gamma (IFNÃÂ³) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS). The CYP27B1 expression was then measured by quantitative real time PCR and correlated with the genotype of the variant. Results: We observed that the MS risk allele of the polymor phism rs10877013 was significantly associated with a low expression of the ABSTRACTS POSTERS ESHG 2014 | MILAN, ITALY | WWW. ESHG.

Conclusion: In this work we demonstrate that the causal variant of MS association at the ch12q14.1 locus, alters the transcription of CYP27B1 gene suggesting that the intracel lular vitamin D levels could be affected. Our data point to lower production of 1,25(OH)2D is the functional cause of the genetic association with MS.",2014

MS is a chronic disease where the inflam mation throughout the brain and spinal cord cause demyelinated plaques of gliotic scar tissue. We have studied the alterations in gene transcription in the EAE induced in the C57/BL6 mouse using real time PCR. We have studied the genes mediating MS progression, such as cytokines and chemo kines, inflammatory and immune response genes, as well as genes involved in cell adhesion, cellular stress and apoptosis whose expressions correlated across multiple analyses. For this purpose female C57/BL6 mice weighing between 18 20 gr were immunized s.c. with 250 ÃÂ¼g of MOG peptide (the 35 55 sequence) emulsified in complete FreundÃ¢ÂÂs adjuvant (CFA) supplemen ted with 4 mg/ml killed M. tuberculosis.

Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a multifactorial autoimmune demyelinating disea se of the CNS. Several large international association studies detected over 100 MS loci. However, for the majority of them the causal variant is not yet identified and, generally, only common variants have been studied. The aim of this study was to follow up the MS loci in the Italian population, searching for the primarily associated variants, focusing also on rare variants. After an association study in 1750 Italian MS cases and 2272 matched controls (Illumina 660 Q, and Immunochip), we selected for target resequencing 32 MS associated regions showing a significant association in the Italian popu lation. The selected regions (1.9 Mb), either including the whole genomic segment (N,17 regions, 45 genes) or only the coding sequences (further 48 genes), were captured (Agilent SureSelect) and sequenced (GAIIx Illumina) in 600 Italian MS patients and 400 matched controls pooled in groups of 12 individuals. We used the variant caller CRISP to call the variants, ANNOVAR to annotate them, and custom R scripts to calculate allele frequency. Validation of a subset of variants by individual genotyping demonstrate a high corre lation with allele frequency in the pools. After QC, results in the MS patients showed that among the 23065 detected variants, 67% were absent in public databases, including 1061 variants with a predicted functional consequence on the gene product (missense, nonsense, splice variants), thus potentially directly involved in the MS susceptibility.

21487,"The Protein Kinase C Alpha (PRKCA) gene, encoding the Th17 cell selective PKCÃÂ± kinase, was repeatedly associated with multiple sclerosis (MS), but the underlying biological mechanism remains unknown. We replicated this genetic association in an Italian population (409 cases, 723 controls), identifying a protective signal, corresponding to a GCC mi crosatellite in the PRKCA promoter (P,0.033, OR,0.12, 95%CI,0.015 0.94), and a risk haplotype in intron 3 (P,7.7*10 4; OR,1.57, 95%CI,1.24 1.99, meta analysis P,1.1*10 12). Expression experiments demonstrated that the protective signal is associated with PRKCA promoter variants confer ring higher expression levels of the gene. Minigene based transfection ex periments proved that the risk signal is driven by an ins/del polymorphism (rs35476409/rs61762387) influencing, with an hnRNP H dependent me chanism, the skipping of a PRKCA alternative exon. Studies performed on RNA extracted from different cell lines and human tissues evidenced a complex pattern of alternatively spliced (AS) PRKCA isoforms, which are modulated by the nonsense mediated mRNA decay (NMD) and display a preferential association with the use of alternative po lyadenilation sites. MS patients showed significantly decreased PRKCA levels (49 cases, 61 controls; P<1*10 4) in peripheral blood mononuclear cells, with a conco mitant unbalance in the relative abundance of its mRNA variants. One of these alternative transcripts is predicted to encode a truncated PKCÃÂ± that, when overexpressed, aberrantly localizes to the plasma membrane and/or in cytoplasmic clusters. Our data suggest that AS NMD coupling, in the presence of specific geno types, modulates PRKCA expression and isoform diversity, and point to a dysregulation of PRKCA splicing in MS, with possible implications in Th17 cell mediated immune responses.",2014
21488,"Congenital myotonias are a group of hereditary muscle disorders that pre sent in infancy and childhood, characterized by impaired muscle relaxation following a voluntary forceful contraction. The core symptoms either relate to myotonia or to periodic weakness. These disorders are caused by muta tions in genes encoding the skeletal muscle chlorides, sodium and calcium channels. We report a 7 years old boy with a severe early onset unique phenotype of myotonia permanents. He had neonatal respiratory failure and as well as severe recurrent episodes of laryngospasm during infancy. Massive general muscle hypertrophy, eye lid myotonia and prolonged hand grip relaxation, were present since early childhood. An unusual complication of tongue hy pertrophy was noted during infancy and reoccurred again after surgical re section. A novel V717G mutation in SCN4A was identified in the proband, but not in his parents. This is the first case of myotonia permanens reporting recurrent tongue hypertrophy as a major clinical feature in this case. Tongue hypertrophy resulted most probably from continued tongue contraction caused by his permanent myotonia .The novel mutation found in SCN4A in this boy, has not been found in his parents. It has been suggested to be pathological by a number of in silico prediction programs. It is located in a well conserved area of the gene in the transmembrane helical part of the Sodium channel protein subunit. This mutation has not been describes previously in SCN4A related disorders.

Neurodegeneration with brain iron accumulation (NBIA) defines a group of neurodegeneration diseases that share prominent extrapyramidal features, dementia and radiographic evidence of iron deposition in the basal ganglia. Different forms of early onset NBIA with autosomal recessive transmission are associated with mutations in specific genes as (1) pantothenate kinase associated neurodegeneration (PKAN); (2) phospholipase associated neu rodegeneration (PLAN); and (3) fatty acid hydroxylase associated neuro degeneration (FAHN). Mutations in PANK2 are the most common cause of these disorders. C19orf12 was recently reported as another causative gene. In this study we recruited 20 subjects with NBIA that include clinical data and associated DNA samples. DNA and clinical information were collected and used after partecipants gave written informed consent. The 8 exons of PANK2 and 3 exons of C19orf12 were amplified by PCR and sequenced on an ABI PRISM 3130 XL AVANT Genetic Analyzer. Phenotypic data were obtai ned by neurologic examination and magnetic resonance imaging. Mutation screening of PANK2 and C19orf12 were found in 3 and 5 patients, respec tively.

21490,"Neural tube is the embryonic precursor of brain and spinal cord, and forms as a consequence of closure of the developing neuroepithelium. If closure events fail, the embryo will manifest a neural tube defect (NTD: spina bifida or exencephaly). Despite significative advances in the field, the elucidation of genetic factors associated to NTD has remained elusive and NTDs are the second most common congenital defects affecting human pregnancies. This project aims at investigating two different aspect of NTDs: on one side the analysis of the transcription factor Sax 1, that was found to be down regulated in a microarray screening in murine NTDs model (Zic2Ku). Sax 1 expression correlates remarkably closely with the progression of posterior closure of the neuroepithelium, overlapping with Zic2 expression. Functio nal studies of Sax1 and Zic2 in zebrafish will be flanked to mouse embryos and in vitro analyses. On the other side, this project investigates the role of miRNAs in neural tube development on human samples. From a database of 534 fetal autopsies, we selected 9 fetuses with NTDs (7 myelomeningoce le, 2 anencephaly).

Recently, a missense mutation in the CLP1 gene has been identified in patients with atrophy of the cerebellum, pons and corpus callosum. We have isolated an ENU induced zebrafish mutant, harbouring a p. R44X nonsense mutation in the Clp1 gene. Using in situ hybridization and morpholino knockdown of p53 we examined the phenotype of homo zygous p. R44X zebrafish embryos. We show that Clp1 knockout zebrafish do not survive beyond 4 days post fertilisation (dpf), have a reduced head size and show an S curved body. At 2dpf, Clp1 knockout fish show reduced expression of midbrain marker otx2, increased cell death in the brain and a disturbed organisation of motor neurons. The phenotype can be partly res cued by injecting human wild type, but not by mutant p. R140H CLP1 mRNA. Morpholino knock down of p53 partially rescues the phenotype as well. We show that Clp1 is an essential gene in both the central and peripheral ner vous system. Similar to the human situation, clp1 mutations cause neuro degeneration and motor neuron problems in zebrafish. We show that the neurodegeneration is mediated by the p53 apoptosis pathway.

Be sides intellectual disability and craniofacial dysmorphisms, WBS patients display hypersociality and comparatively well preserved language skills while 7dup ASD is associated with impairments of varying severity across the autistic spectrum. The striking symmetry in genotype and phenotype between the two conditions points to the 7q11.23 cluster as a surprisingly small subset of dosage sensitive genes affecting social behavior and cogniti on. The molecular phenotypes of these syndromes in disease relevant cell types remain to be elucidated however, due to scarce availability of primary diseased tissues. Convergent evidence both from human studies and mouse models, points to transcriptional dysregulation as a critical aspect of both conditions, consistent with the presence of several transcription factors in the 7q11.23 interval. Here we present the first analysis of transcriptional dysregulation in human physiopathologically relevant cell types carrying 7q11.23 dosage imbalan ces. We selected a large and unique panel of WBS and 7dup ASD patients and derived induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) with the most advanced reprogramming technology based on synthetic mRNAs.

Introduction Recently, genetic bases of neurodevelopmental diseases including CNS anomalies, intellectual disability (ID), and epilepsy have been significantly elucidated, but are still largely unknown. We have developed a target and whole exome sequencing (WES) based mutation screening strategy. The tar get sequencing system enabled us to screen 284 genes associated with neu rodevelopmental disorders. Unresolved patients were studied by proband parent trio approach using WES. Materials and Methods Forty seven patients were included in the study. Fourteen patients were stu died by WES. They were analyzed under the approval by our institutional ethics committee. To capture the exonic DNAs, we used SureSelectXT Cu stom capture library for neuronal genes capture. We performed sequencing using Illumina HiSeq 2000 sequencer and obtained paired end sequence reads. We excluded known variants found in dbSNP , 1000 Genomes Project, ESP6500 and our control samples, and narrowed the candidates to missen se, nonsense SNVs and frameshift indels. ResultsFourteen mutations including FOXG1, AHI1, PTPN11, DYRK1A, ACTB, CASK, GABRD were identified by target screening and conventional sequencing. WES revealed de novo mutations in CREBBP , KIF1A, GRIN2A and ALDH18A1. HNRNPH2 and AMMECR1 mutations were noted in X linked pattern. None of these mutations were recorded in database. Some other mutations have unknown pathogenic significance. Discussion NGS method could clarify a consistent percentage of patients with neuro developmental disorders.

A global approach using high throughput technologies such as NGS could be of great help to improve their diagnosis. We present our experience in the analysis of Neurological diseases using a 200 gene NGS targeted re sequencing panel. Samples from 48 patients were submitted to our laboratory for genetic testing. Clinical diagnosis included Spastic Paraplegia (17), Motor/Sensitive Hereditary Neuropathy (12), Ata xia (6), Parkinson (4), Miastenia (3), Joubert Syndrome (2), Frontotempo ral Dementia (2), Hyperkalemic Periodic Paralysis (1) and SMA (1). Coding exons and splice site regions of the genes associated with each pathology were analysed. Enrichment and sequencing were carried out using Sure Select Enrichment System (Agilent) and SOLiD 5500/MiSeq (Life Technolo gies/Illumina). Mean depth was established at 200x. In 7 out of 48 samples (14%), a genetic cause that justifies the clinical dia gnosis was found. Taking into account all the samples, 63 variants (confir med by Sanger sequencing) were identified and classified into pathogenic (7), probably pathogenic (2), Unknown (53) and probably benign (1).

Based on cerebral MR imaging (cMRI) neuronal migration disorders (NMD) can be subdivided into various radiological forms including classic and cobblestone lissencephaly. Method Genetic testing was performed for 1034 index patients either (1) individual ly after in house cMRI reevaluation (n,214) or (2) as assigned by the refer ring doctor (n,820). Individual testing strategies included MLPA analysis, Sanger sequencing and massive parallel sequencing.

Results119 NMD patients of study arm 1 were genetically analyzed leading to the identification of the underlying genetic alterations in 35.3% of the analy zed samples incl. classic lissencephaly 65.4%, subcortical band heterotopia 83.3%, polymicrogyria 10.0%, cobblestone lissencephaly 14.3%, periven tricular nodular heterotopia 37.5% and complex cortical malformations 20.0%. In comparison, the overall mutation detection rate in study arm 2 without in house cMRI reevaluation was only 18.5% (p<0.0005).Overall, pathogenic mutations were identified in 18.9% of independent pa tients incl.

Our preliminary data suggest a genotype dependant antiepileptic response in LIS1 associated classic lissencephaly. ConclusionGenome wide genetic testing strategies will further improve the number of identified genes and genetic alterations, but continue to require their criti cal interpretation in the context of clinical findings and cerebral imaging.

VEGF re leased from bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells also activated SphK by binding to VEGFR2, resulting in decreased sphingosine storage as well as improved PN survival and clinical outcomes in NP C cells and mice. Similar effects were noted after genetic and pharmacologic replenishment of VEGF in NP C mice. Further, iPSC derived human NP C neurons were generated for the first time and the sphingosine accumulation caused by SphK inac tivity in these cells was corrected by replenishment of VEGF.

Furthermore, we demon strate distinct genotype phenotype correlations. Severe encephalopathic phenotypes are significantly more often caused by truncating mutations in GRIN2A , whereas missense mutations are by far more common in benign Rolandic epilepsy patients. For GRIN2B , the majority of ASD individuals pre sent with truncating mutations, whereas all epilepsy cases appear to have gain of function mutations. The severity of phenotypes depends on the af fected domain and the extent of receptor activation. Our observations high light the so far underestimated role of dysregulated NMDA signalling in both frequent and rare epilepsy disorders and reveal promising pharmacologic targets for novel therapeutic approaches.",2014
21503,"Noonan syndrome (NS) is an autosomal dominant multisystem disorder (1/2,000 live births) caused by mutations in genes dysregulating the RAS MAPK pathway. The syndrome belongs to the RASopathies that includes Costello syndrome (CS), Cardio facio cutaneous syndrome (CFC), Neurofi bromatosis type 1 (NF1) and other syndromes sharing a common pattern of congenital anomalies. Recently the RIT1 gene encoding for a new mem ber of the RAS subfamily was functionally characterized. Moreover, gain of function mutations in RIT1 gene were found in 9% of the individuals with Noonan syndrome or a related condition without detectable mutations in known Noonan related genes. In order to confirm these findings, we exami ned 11 patients suspicious of Noonan syndrome/RASopathies including one abortion with Hydrops fetalis and one prenatal case presenting with nuchal translucency > 97th pct and a normal karyotype. In an initial study, all 11 pa tients were screened for mutations in the known genes for Noonan syndro me or RASopathies using a panel of 12 genes (PTPN11, SOS1, RAF1, KRAS, BRAF, NRAS, MAP2K1, CBL, SHOC2, MAP2K2, HRAS, NF1). DNA sequence analysis was carried out on the Illumina MiSeq Next Generation Sequencing platform. Data analysis was performed using the CLCbio workbench (v6.5) and custom developed Perl scripts. Target regions with a coverage of less than 20X were reanalyzed by Sanger sequencing in order to ensure com plete coverage of all coding regions and adjacent splice sites ( 20/+10). No causal mutations could be identified using the 12 gene panel. In a second step all patients were screened for mutations in RIT1 gene using Sanger se quencing.",2014

The NPC1 gene spans more than 47 kb, located at locus 18q11, and encodes for an 1278 amino acid protein located primarily into late endosomes. Mu tations in this gene are associated to Niemann Pick type C (NP C) disease, which is a fatal autosomal recessive lysosomal disorder characterized by storage of unesterified glycolipids and cholesterol that leads to progressive neurodegeneration. The aim of this work was to define pathogenic variati ons in patients with clinical suspicion of NP C. In total, 244 DNA samples were included. DNA was isolated from peripheral blood by standard me thods. The whole coding region of the gene was amplified by PCR and se quenced by Sanger sequencing followed by electrophoresis in the genetic analyzer ABI3130xl. Sequence variations were compared to data in the NP C database (http://npc.fzk.de/) and in silico analyses were performed when necessary. Fourteen new variations were identified in 20 DNA samples that were classified as pathogenic. From those, 4 (28,57%) mutations (p. P434S, p. S667L, p. G911S, p. V1115F) are responsible for change in amino acid po larity, and two of those are located within transmembrane regions. Additio nal changes were observed in other functional domains, such as in disulfide bond (p. C238R), and in cholesterol binding and transfer (p. A183T) regions. Same of them (p. C238R, p. P434S, p.

21505,"The PARK2 gene encodes Parkin, a component of a multiprotein E3 ubiquitin ligase complex that targets misfolded proteins for proteasomal degradation, such as dopamine transporters, synaptotagmin and ? synuclein. PARK2 ge netic mutations are associated with Parkinson Disease, while Copy Number Variants (CNV) have been found in patients with developmental delay (DD), Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and ASD. We identified 5 male patients with inherited PARK2 deletions in 342 ASD indi viduals, screened for CNVs using Illumina 1M SNP arrays (frequency,1.5%). Three patients had a 45Kb deletion of intron 9, and two patients had a deleti on of either 29Kb in intron 6 or 266Kb encompassing exons 5 and 6. Clinical presentation was heterogeneous in these ASD patients. A literature search showed recurrent deletions of introns 2 and 3 (N,15 ADHD, N,7 ASD), as well as exons 1 (N,1 ASD) and 2 (N,2 ASD and DD), while DECIPHER re ported one ASD individual with an exon 5 6 deletion. In available control databases, deletions of segments from exons 1 to intron 4 as well as intron 9 were recurrent, but only 1/4139 controls had a CNV overlapping exon 6, suggesting a pathogenic role of deletions in this region. The smaller exon 6 CNVs deleted a functional domain SYT11 binding site, compromising the attachment of synaptotagmin and ubiquitination. These results support a role of PARK2 structural variants in ASD. However, certain PARK2 regions are also frequently deleted in control subjects, and therefore rigorous analysis is mandatory before assuming a pathogenic role for identified CNVs.",2014
21506,"Mutations in the glucocerebrosidase (GBA) gene increase risk of Parkinson Disease (PD). We determined the frequency and relative risk of the two most frequent GBA mutations in a large series of Italian patients with PD or other parkinsonisms. We studied 2,766 unrelated consecutive patients with diagnosis of primary degenerative parkinsonism (including 2,350 PD), and 1,111 controls, who contributed to the Parkinson Institute Biobank (www.parkinsonbiobank.com). The entire cohort was screened for mutations in GBA exons 9 (containing p. N370S) and 10 (containing p. L444P), covering approximately 50% of GBA mutations. Five mutations were identified in the heterozygous state: 4 missense (p. N370S, p. L444P , p. E388K, p. D443N), and the splicing mutation IVS10+1G>T , which we showed to result in the in frame exon 10 skipping. GBA mutations were significantly more frequent in PD (4.5%, RR,7.2) and Dementia with Lewy Bodies (DLB) (13.8%, RR, 21.9), compared to controls (0.63%), but not in the other form of parkinso nisms, such as Progressive Supranuclear Palsy (PSP)(2%), Corticobasal De generation (CBD)(0%), and Multiple System Atrophy (MSA)(0.85%). Consi dering only the PD group (2,350), GBA carriers had an earlier onset (51ÃÂ±10 vs. 56ÃÂ±10, p<0.0001) and were more likely to have a positive family history for PD (34% vs. 20%, p<0.001). GBA mutations in the Italian population resulted one of the major genetic factor predisposing to synucleinopathies (parkinsonisms due to alpha synuclein deposition: PD and DLB), but not to tauopathies (parkinsonisms due to tau deposition, PSP and CBD), with the exception of MSA, another synucleinopathy. This suggests a different patho genic mechanism for MSA compared to PD.",2014
21507,"Background: In an epidemiological study carried out in an isolated popu lation of South Eastern Moravia in the Czech Republic, a surprisingly high prevalence of parkinsonism was found, differing from the published preva lence rates in other European countries. Objective: To determine the type of mutation in families with autosomal dominant parkinsonism with demen tia. Methods: On the basis of a detailed genealogical examination of all the individuals with confirmed parkinsonism, the pedigrees were compiled and a DNA analysis of probands from each pedigree was subsequently initiated. A massive parallel sequencing method using Ion Torrent technology was used; the DNA sequence analysis was focused on the gene loci in which the causal mutations related to ParkinsonÃ¢ÂÂs disease (PD) have been described. Results: Three large pedigrees with an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern with reduced penetration of parkinsonism were identified. None of the previously described pathogenic mutations associated with PD were found; rare variants or yet undescribed mutations were also found. In 5 of 10 examined probands, a novel missense Q230H mutation of the MAPT gene was detected. Polyphene and SIFT in silico predictors indicate this mutati on as Ã¢ÂÂprobably damagingÃ¢ÂÂ. Conclusion: Confirmation sequencing using an independent method is underway to examine the targeted MAPT mutation in other individuals from all three pedigrees and to compare it with healthy controls.

Over a hundred mutations in PCDH19 gene have been identified in girls with epilepsy, with or without cognitive impair ment. While some mutations are recurrent, many new variants remain pri vate. Furthermore, transmitting hemizygous males are devoid of seizures or cognitive impairment, making it difficult to establish the pathogenic nature of newly identified variants.

Using sequence information, we compared different computational prediction methods. We also used homology modelling to build structural models of two PCDH19 EC domains containing the novel missense mutations. Wild type and mutant models were compared to identify the differences in the presence and type of residue interactions or in the biochemical properties (conservation, electrostatic charge, hydrophobicity) of the model surfaces. This analysis revealed that these novel mutations exert their pathogenic role using different molecular mechanisms. Two of them interfere with or alter functional residues predicted to mediate ligand or protein binding, another alters the EC domain folding stability, and the frame shift mutation produ ces a truncated protein lacking the intracellular domain. We also observed that the two girls with severe neurological impairment carry mutations predicted to have the worst effects on the protein struc ture.",2014
21509,"PEHO syndrome (Progressive encephalopathy with Edema, Hypsarrhyth mia and Optic atrophy; MIM 260565) is an autosomal recessive inherited progressive infantile encephalopathy. The main features of PEHO syndrome are hypotonia, infantile spasms and/or hypsarrhythmia, psychomotor retar dation, absence or early loss of visual fixation, edema of the face and limbs, and typical dysmorphic features. Brain atrophy is progressive and most pro minent in the cerebellum, where the molecular layer is strongly reduced, Purkinje cells are deformed and misaligned, and the cells of the granule cell layer are significantly reduced in number. In addition, the optic nerves show varying degrees of loss of myelinated axons and gliosis, and the retinal ner ve fiber and ganglion cell layers are atrophic. A number of patients present with many of these clinical features, but lack typical neuroradiological and neuropathological findings or progression of brain atrophy and do not have the PEHO founder mutation. These patients are classified as having PEHO like syndrome. This group is clinically heterogeneous and therefore it is li kely that there are multiple underlying genes. To characterize the genetic background of patients showing PEHO like features, we performed exome sequencing of 33 Finnish patients, and parents of six of them. We identified likely pathogenic mutations in known disease genes (CDKL5, ABAT , SPTAN1, SCN2A, MT CYB, WDR45 and KCNQ2) in nine individuals. Analysis of muta tions in novel disease genes is ongoing. Our preliminary findings imply that patients with PEHO like features are genetically highly heterogeneous and that the entity overlaps with early infantile epileptic encephalopathies.",2014
21510,"Disorders involving neuron mispositioning encompass a heterogeneous group of phenotypes affecting neuronal development. Periventricular he terotopia (PH) is one such disorder characterised by failure of neurons to migrate to the outer cortex of the brain, resulting in ectopic positioning along their sites of origin Ã¢ÂÂ the lateral ventricles. Although mutations in FLNA account for an estimated 80% of familial PH cases, mutations at this locus account for only 25% of sporadic cases, leaving the vast majority with no genetic diagnosis. Here we describe a project intended to characterise the mutational heterogeneity underlying PH and gain insight into the mole cular networks that when defective underpin this disorder. We describe an approach involving careful phenotyping of each proband and employ a trio design to exome sequence characterise causative mutations. This study will encompass both non syndromic and syndromic cases of PH and seek to map candidate causative variants into gene interaction networks. Similar approaches have proved successful for other neurological disorders such as autism. Illustrating the legitimacy of our approach we describe an identified de novo mutation in a gene encoding a calmodulin isoform. The mutation re sides in one of four highly conserved calcium binding pockets of this protein where it is predicted to alter function. Substantial evidence demonstrates direct binding between calmodulin and filaminA. Although the exact patho genic status of this variant has yet to be corroborated by a second individual, this illustrative case demonstrates that functional genetic relationships can contribute to the implication of extremely heterogeneous disorders such as PH.",2014

Six teen children had the commonest form of infantile onset PLAN, with early onset of psychomotor regression, hypotonia, cerebellar signs and abnormal ocular movements. The phenotype was highly homogeneous, with rapid de velopment of severe spastic tetraparesis, cognitive impairment, optic atro phy, and cerebellar atrophy at brain MRI. Motor neuropathy and EEG fast rhythms were also frequent. Nine patients from six families shared the same founder mutation (p. V691del) which likely arose in the late seventeenth century. Only one patient fits the diagnosis of the much rarer childhood onset PLAN. Despite the early onset (18 months), progression of cerebellar and pyramidal signs was slower, with behavioral disturbances and dystonia. Typical features of infantile onset PLAN such as hypotonia, nystagmus/stra bismus, optic atrophy, EEG fast rhythms and motor neuropathy were absent. Besides cerebellar atrophy, MRI showed iron deposition in the basal ganglia. This patient carried a missense mutation predicted to be less deleterious.",2014

Autism is a genetic disorder, with an estimated heritability greater than 90%. Over the past years, the convergence of genomic technologies has led to the identification of several susceptibility loci by means of linkage stu dies. Autism is associated with epilepsy in early childhood and epilepsy occurs in 10 30% of autism patients. Recently, a role of potassium inward rectifying channels in the pathogenesis of autism disease has been postu lated due to the identification in patients affected by autism and epilepsy of two mutations in the KCNJ10 gene. The gene encodes the Kir4.1 channel which is expressed in astrocytes and neurons. We then searched for mutati on in the KNCJ10 gene, as well as in two genes (KCNJ2 and KCNJ16) coding for additional Kir channels with reported expression in astrocytes and neu rons, in two unrelated patients. We detected a new mutation in the KCNJ2 gene in a boy affected by autism.

These symptomes are attributed to a homozygous deletion on chromosome 2p21, encompassing the genes SLC3A1 and PREPL . Since loss of function SLC3A1 mutations cause isolated cystinuria, the other HCS symptoms have been considered to be caused by PREPL deficiency.

Immediately after birth, the patient presented with severe muscular hypo tonia and feeding problems, followed by growth hormone deficiency and hypergonadotropic hypogonadism. Initial molecular analyses excluded a number of syndromes, including Prader Willi (PWS). The homozygous de letion in PREPL identified by array analysis corresponded to heterozygous deletions in each of the nonconsanguineous parents. qPCR analysis confir med these findings and pinpointed the extent of the deletion to exons 5 10. An isolated homozygous microdeletion involving only PREPL has not been previously described, however, RÃÂ©gal et al ., (in press) recently identified a patient carrying a nonsense mutation in PREPL combined with a microde letion involving SLC3A1 and PREPL , resulting in a similar phenotype to the case presented here. These findings may contribute to further delineate the normal function of PREPL, as well as support the notion that homozygous PREPL inactivation should be considered in the diagnosis of patients with a PWS phenotype, but no PWS genotype (Maartens et al ., Biol Chem 387;879 883,2006).",2014

Genome wide linkage analysis and whole exome sequencing were done, followed by realtime PCR and immunofluorescent microsco py. Genome wide linkage analysis mapped the disease associated gene to 0.5Mb on chromosome 17p13.3. Whole exome sequencing identified two mutations within this locus, which were common to the affected individuals: compound heterozygous mutations in VPS53, segregating as expected for autosomal recessive heredity within all four families, and common in Mo roccan Jews (~1:37 carrier rate). The Golgi associated retrograde protein (GARP) complex is involved in the retrograde pathway recycling endocytic vesicles to Golgi.

PE can pri marily be divided into neurodegenerative and metabolic, the latter defined by defects in subcellular organelles or in the intermediary metabolism of macromolecules. In the neurodegenerative disorders, progressive loss of neural tissue is often detected by cerebral MRI or markers in the cerebro spinal fluid. PE is associated with high morbidity and mortality rate, but treatment options are available for some PE disorders. Genetic explanations lack for about 20% of PE disorders, which are classified according to MRI findings and phenotype. Our aim is to characterize novel mutations causing PE.

We screened 2 agnathia cases for orthodenticle homeobox 2 (OTX2), paired related homeobox 1 (PRRX1) genes and for the homeobox 2 (PRRX2) gene by sequencing in a ABIPRISM 3130xl genetic analyzer. In the first case, a full autopsy in the fetus proband of 12+6 weeks, revealed agnathia, holoprosencephaly, cyclopia, microstomia, malformed pinnae (misplaced toward the angle of the mandible), omphalocele and shortening of the long bones. The cytogenetic analysis showed a partial trisomy 13 and partial monosomy 18.

The spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 (SCA2) is caused by CAGn expansion at ATXN2 gene, which account for 50% of the variability in age at onset (AO). Previous reports pointed to CAGn variations and polymorphisms at other genes as responsible for the remaining AO variance. Aims: to address a con firmation study of other polyglutamine tracts and of a mitochondrial DNA polymorphism as modifiers of AO in SCA2 patients. Methods: symptomatic individuals with a molecular diagnosis of SCA2 were recruited from Bra zil. Capillary electrophoresis was performed to detect CAG lengths at SCA1, SCA2, SCA3/MJD, SCA6, SCA7 and RAI1 associated genes; the mitochondrial complex I gene polymorphism (10398G) was determined by PCR followed by restriction endonuclease analysis. Pearson correlations with AO were tested against each CAGn for each individual; the 10398G polymorphism of one person per maternal lineage was analysed by t test; all followed by a step wise linear regression. Results: 57 individuals (33 families and 42 maternal lineages) were studied. Mean (range) AO and CAGn at normal and expanded ATXN2 alleles were 32.9 (3 76) years and 23 (22 33) and 42 (34 67) repeats. At first, AO correlated with the large alleles at ATXN2 and ATXN3 genes, and with small allele at RAI1. 10398G was not associated with AO. On step wise regression, the unique correlation maintained was with ATXN2 expanded allele (r , 0.78; r2 , 0.61; p < 0.0001).

In the last few years, innovative technologies have been widely applied to the genetic study of schizophrenia. This multicenter study aims to apply aCGH and NGS technologies to investigate genetic risk factors for spe cific SCZD related endophenotypes that greatly affect real life functioning of people with schizophrenia or variables strongly associated with it. To inve stigate the contribution of de novo CNVs to schizophrenia vulnerability, we have used the Enhancer Chip (PLoS One 2012;7(12):e52264 ), a customized aCGH recently developed by our group, which is able to examine CNVs in the whole human genome as well as testing over 1,250 enhancers for their potential pathogenic role. Clinical research units have provided us DNAs from 60 sporadic SCZD patients and their parents (family trios). To date, we have identified two de novo partially overlapping deletions at 7q31.2 in unrelated SCZD patients. Interestingly, both CNVs include MET. This proto oncogene has been previously associated to schizophrenia (Am J Psychiatry 2010;167(4):436). Another SCZD patient presented a de novo duplication at 19p13.3. A similar rearrangement is reported in Decipher, possibly asso ciated to intellectual disability. De novo protein altering mutations will be also investigated by NGS based exome sequencing of all family trios recrui ted (now in progress). These preliminary data may help to strengthen the role of de novo variants in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia.",2014
21522,"Background: Schizophrenia is one of the major psychiatric disorders. It is a disorder of complex inheritance, involving both heritable and environmen tal factors. DNA methylation is a fundamental inheritable epigenetic modi fication that stably alters the gene expression levels. We reasoned that ge netic modifications, resulting from environmental stimuli could also make a contribution to the disease development. Materials and Methods: We have performed 26 high resolution genome wide methylation array analyses to determine the methylation status of 27,627 CpG islands and compared the data between patients and healthy controls. Methylation profiles of DNAs were analyzed in six pools (220 schi zophrenia patients; 220 age matched healthy controls; 110 female schizo phrenia patients; 110 age matched healthy females; 110 male schizophre nia patients; 110 age matched healthy males) and 20 individual patient DNA samples (7 females and 13 males).Results: We find significant differences in the methylation profile between schizophrenia and control DNA pools.

Among males DHX37, MAP2K2, FNDC4, GIPC1 genes represent the most si gnificant candidate genes . Conclusion: Our data revealed substantial differences in methylation pro files between schizophrenia patients and controls and between male and female patients. Dysregulated activity of these candidate genes could play a role in schizophrenia pathogenesis.",2014
21523,"Childhood Onset Schizophrenia (COS) is a severe neurodevelopmental dis order, for which the genetic etiology remains largely unknown. Recently, whole exome sequencing studies have identified severe rare de novo vari ants in sporadic cases of adult onset schizophrenia and autism. In this study, we performed exome sequencing of 17 COS trios with the aim of identifying de novo variants in the COS affected children. We identified 20 de novo mu tations in 17 probands, which is consistent with the de novo mutation rate thus far identified in adult form of schizophrenia. Our findings also suggest that de novo missense variants identified in our study have a high likelihood for pathogenicity. In fact, the pool of genes we found to present de novo va riants appears to be enriched for genes that are less likely to tolerate such alterations. Among the genes found to be disrupted in our study, there is evidence suggesting that some of them are involved in neuronal functions. Moreover some of these genes were previously reported to be associated with neurodevelopmental disorders. Hence this list of genes should be con sidered to represent genuine COS candidate genes. We believe that insights from the identification of COS genes may help to develop diagnostic tools, which in turn may help to intervene before the onset of symptoms. Even tually, knowing the genetic etiology may lead to the identification of thera peutic avenues for better treatment.",2014
21524,"Schizophrenia (SCZ) is a severe neuropsychiatric disorder. SCZ genome wide association studies (GWAS) have identified common single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and a large polygenic contribution to illness risk, but biological mechanisms remain unclear. The known role of microRNAs (miRNAs) as potent disease modifiers in neuropsychiatric disorders raises the question of whether genetic variation in miRNAs plays a critical role in SCZ etiology. Therefore, we implemented a systematic set based test for all miRNAs de fined in the miRBase based on test statistics from GWAS data. Results from the largest SCZ meta analyses to date [Ripke et al., 2013] provided the basis for this analysis. Alike the popular gene set testing tool VEGAS [Liu et al., 2010], SNPs in within miRNAs were grouped together, corrected for linkage disequilibrium and controlled for the number of SNPs within each miRNA to calculate a miRNA test statistic. From all analyzed miRNAs, 2.76% were significantly associated with SCZ after correction for multiple testing; further 18.90% were nominal signi ficant. As expected from the GWAS results, the strongest association was found for hsa mir 137. Moreover, miRNAs involved in neural and synapse development such as mir 9 and let 7 as well as in miRNAs with yet unknown function were identified. Further evaluation of targets from significantly as sociated miRNAs as well as their presence in brain QTLs will be presented. Overall, our results give the first unbiased screening of miRNA association based on large SCZ GWAS data and might lead to the discovery of key players suitable for further functional studies.",2014
21525,"Schizophrenia (SZ) has a high heritability (about 80%), but the genetic ar chitecture of the disease is still unclear. The numerous genome wide asso ciation studies and the recent next generation sequencing analyses indicated that about 32% of the genetic variability of SZ is due to the additive effect of a high number of susceptibility alleles with a modest effect size and/or to the presence of rare deleterious copy number variants (CNVs) or coding single nucleotide variants (SNVs). To evaluate the contribution of rare reces sive homozygous SNVs in SZ, we initially identified, with SNP array analysis of 180 unrelated SZ patients, the offspring of mates that are closely related (inbreeding) and therefore have an increased prior probability to carry po tentially deleterious recessive mutations; subsequently, we performed who le exome sequencing analysis of these patients. An average of 269 (min max: 196 384) functional (frameshift, missense and nonsense) homozygous SNVs has been observed in the autozygous regions of the 7 sequenced patients. About 8 SNVs per individual are novel (not in dbSNP , 1000G and dbESP6500) and have a high phyloP conservation score. Among these, we identified, in three patients, three different SNVs represen ting good candidate SZ mutations, since they are predicted to be damaging and map in genes mainly expressed in brain and previously associated with SZ. Our data suggest that rare homozygous SNVs could be involved in the clini cal phenotype of SZ, at least in patients with high level of autozygosity.",2014

To provide additional genetic evidence for any of the genes suggested by the exome sequencing study, we performed a follow up study focusing on copy number variants (CNVs). We screened 1,637 patients and 1,627 controls for CNVs in any of the genes suggested by the exome sequencing study. Duplications in RB1CC1 on chromosome 8 were overrepresented in patients. The duplica tions were followed up in independent European samples. In the combined analysis, comprising of 8,461 patients and 112,871 controls, duplications in RB1CC1 were associated with schizophrenia (P , 1.29 x 10 5; odds ratio , 8.58). The aim of the present study was to further explore RB1CC1 as a candidate gene for schizophrenia. The gene consists of 24 exons. We focused our targeted resequencing on exon 15: (i) it contains >30% of the geneÃ¢ÂÂs total protein coding sequence, and (ii) Xu et al. (2011) identified a de novo frameshift deletion in this exon. After quality control, the data from 1740 patients were available. Among 22 patients, a total of 17 different variants were identified and verified by sequencing the complementary strand. Of these, 10 were neither detected in the 1000 Genomes Project nor the Exo me Variant Server. Currently, we are analyzing whether these variants co segregate with a psychiatric diagnosis within the families of the affected probands. Furthermore, detailed phenotypic description of the mutation carriers are being assembled.",2014

Isolated populations represent an advantage to identify rare disease vari ants that may appear at higher frequencies compared to outbred popula tions. In this work, we use the Faroese population to test this hypothesis, and combine low depth (6X) whole genome (WGS) and high depth (35X) whole exome (WES) sequencing approaches to describe genomic variation, de novo mutations and perform association mapping in patients with schi zophrenia (SZ) and bipolar disorder (BP). Our sample consists of 106 SZ cases, 28 BP and 214 controls (344 total): together with unrelated individuals, it includes 54 complete trios. A total of 17,345,307 and 259,904 variants have been called in WGS and WES respectively. We discovered 9,130 de novo mutations in WGS and 417 in WES. Clear differences emerge between WGS and WES in identifying dif ferent types of variants. A specificity of this work is the combination of WGS and WES in the discovery of de novo mutations: both approaches discover the same number of de novo loss of function mutations but high depth WES is clearly more powerful in calling coding variants, mostly because of depth filtering criteria. In the association mapping we identified 6 genome wide significant loci, which are currently being replicated in 3,300 BP and controls from UCL.

Copy number variations (CNVs) have been implicated in neurodevelopmental and psychiatric conditions, such as autism and schizo phrenia, but it is not clear to what extent they might contribute to reading and language abilities. Using data from a longitudinal study investigating the development of children between 3 and 7 years of age, we performed CNV analysis (n,94 children; 65% family risk of dyslexia, 23% language im paired, 12% typically developing) and identified a large deletion on chro mosome 15q13.1 13.3 in an individual with an early age SLI diagnosis. This single copy deletion spanning BP3 BP5 (~3.2Mb) was validated by qPCR, and shown to be de novo. Both parents and a sibling are non carriers of this deletion and do not display any reading or language deficits, suggesting this deletion may be directly involved in the phenotype of the proband. This is the first report of a BP3 BP5 deletion to be identified in an SLI cohort, in the absence of intellectual disability.

Several studies estimated alpha synuclein level in blood cells of PD patients. However the alpha synuclein level in uncontami nated fraction of the peripheral blood lymphocytes remains unknown. Here we examined alterations in alpha synuclein level in magneticaly separated CD45+ cells from the whole blood in 18 drug naÃÂ¯ve patients with sporadic PD and in 23 controls without neurological disorders by ELISA method (Hu man alpha synuclein ELISA kit, Invitrogen, USA).

21531,"Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) are both motor neuron disorders. Several studies have tried to establish a link between the two diseases but the subject is still under debate. It has been reported that large expansions of the hexanucleotide GGGGCC in intron 1 of the C9ORF72 gene are often responsible for familial and sporadic ALS cases. On the other side, mutations in the SMN1 gene cause SMA and its highly ho mologous copy, SMN2, is a phenotypic modifier. Objective: We investigated whether the number of the hexanucleotide repeats in C9ORF72 was asso ciated with the phenotype and the number of SMN2 copies in a group of 162 SMA patients. Methods: Conventional PCR was used to determine values within the normal range (less than 30 repeats), while Repeat Primed PCR (RP PCR) and Southern blot methods were used to exclude the existence of large expansions that are out of the range to be amplified by conventional methodology. Results: No pathological (> 30 repeats) or premutated alleles (20 30 repeats) were found. The allelic distribution of the C9ORF72 gene in SMA patients overlapped with the data obtained in our control population discarding putative repeats that may be associated with the disease. No as sociation was either observed with the SMA phenotype or the number of SMN2 copies. Conclusion: The involvement of C9ORF72 as a genetic marker in SMA is unlikely. Current investigation of modifier genes in SMA should consider other possible candidates (Supported by FIS 11 2606).ABSTRACTS POSTERS ESHG 2014 | MILAN, ITALY | WWW. ESHG. ORG 194Back to inde x",2014
21532,"Spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 (SCA2), an autosomal dominant neurodegene rative disease, is caused by the expansion of a CAG triplet repeat located in the N terminal coding region of the ATXN2 gene. Alleles of the ATXN2 gene that carry 13 31 CAG trinucleotide repeats are present in normal individu als. Contrariwise, alleles with a CAG triplet repeat number of >31 and up to approximately 200 are present in patients with SCA2. Although the detail mechanism of pathogenesis is yet to be defined, neurotoxin, especially reac tive oxygen species (ROS), released from aggregated mutant proteins, may play a role in the pathogenic process. In this study, the lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) isolated from SCA2 patients were utilized to compare with the wild type lymphoblastoid cells. We investigated the crucial relationship bet ween the expression of p ERK1/2 and autophagy. Results found the endo genous p ERK1/2 and autophagy marker protein, Atg8 (LC3 class II) were higher in SCA2 patients. Electron micrographs showed that only the cells expressing expanded Ataxin 2 contained aggregated protein and autophagic vacuoles. Based on the above observations we hypothesized that the aggre gated mutant Ataxin 2 proteins may generate ROS in mitochondria, which subsequently up regulate Atg8 expression levels and ultimately lead to au tophagy and cell death.",2014
21533,"Tourette syndrome (TS) is a childhood onset neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by involuntary movements and vocalizations, known as tics. The etiology of TS is complex and largely unknown, but has a strong genetic component. IMMP2L (inner mitochondrial membrane peptidase, subunit 2) is one of the few genes that have been suggested to increase susceptibility to TS, after identification of chromosomal rearrangements affecting IMMP2L in several families with TS or tics. However, to date only a single study has investigated the role of structural copy number variations (CNVs) of IMMP2L in a small cohort of TS patients without finding any deletions/duplications. Through CNV screening of a cohort of 188 unrelated TS patients and 316 controls from Denmark, we identified seven patients (3.7%) and 3 controls (0.9%) with intragenic IMMP2L deletions, thus, the frequency of IMMP2L deletions was significantly higher in patients than in controls (P, 0.0447).Four of the deletions identified in the patients did not include any known exons of IMMP2L, but were within intron 3. These deletions were found to affect a shorter IMMP2L mRNA species with two alternative 5Ã¢ÂÂ exons, one of which included the ATG start codon. We showed that this short transcript and the previously published long transcript were expressed in several brain regions, with particularly high expression in cerebellum and hippocampus. The current findings give further evidence for the role of IMMP2L as a sus ceptibility factor in TS and suggest that intronic changes in disease suscep tibility genes should be investigated further for presence of alternatively spliced exons.",2014

Transthyretin (TTR), a plasma and cerebrospinal fluid protein secreted by the liver and choroid plexus, is mainly known as the physiological carrier of thyroxine (T(4)) and retinol. Under pathological conditions, various TTR missense mutations are known to destabilize the tetramer composed of mutant and wild type subunits, causing misfolding of the protein and fibril aggregation. This condition is associated with the amyloid diseases: senile systemic amyloidosis, familial amyloid polyneuropathy (FAP), familial amy loid cardiomyopathy (FAC). Direct sequencing of TTR gene detects more than 99% of disease causing mutations. In twelve years we analyzed 562 subjects, referred to our service by neu rologists and cardiologists. About 47% of the exams were required for po lyneuropathy, 33% for cardiac impairment and 20% for familiarity for TTR mutations. We found the causative mutation (index cases) in 80/428 subjects with no familiarity for TTR related diseases and in 78/134 subjects with a family history of the disorder. The most frequent mutation in our cohort is Ile68Leu (31%), typically present in cases with cardiac involvement, followed by Phe64Leu (22%), Val30Met (15%) , Glu89Gln (14%) and Thr49Ala (5%). A novel mutation has been identified in exon 2: Val14Leu. The subject was affected by cardiac amyloidosis. The Detection Rate achieved is good, keeping in mind the complexity of cli nical diagnosis.

Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA, United States. Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is due to mutations in TSC1 or TSC2 but 15% of patients have no mutation identified (NMI). A recent study suggests that NMI patients are mosaic TSC. A TSC1/TSC2 mutation in a neural crest progenitor would explain NMI patients without tubers and subependymal nodules (SENs), because neural crest is the origin of the majority of extrac ranial lesions in TSC. We performed 2 studies aiming to support this hy pothesis. First, a review of the MRIs of 220 TSC patients was performed to assess the phenotype genotype of patients with tubers or SENs but not both lesions. In our cohort, 6/220 (2.7%) patients, all with NMI, had tubers wi thout SENs, and five of the 6 patients had 3 or fewer tubers. Patients with SENs without tubers were not identified. This suggests that patients with NMI and absence of SENs had a first postzygotic mutation in neuroecto derm, which gives rise to neural crest progenitors harbouring the mutation. Second, we studied 19 patients with possible TSC who had brain MRI. Five of the 19 patients had TSC1/TSC2 mutational analysis, which was NMI. None of the 19 had tubers or SENs.

The lack of therapeutic strate gies that effectively prevent neurodegeneration in MJD patients prompted us to search for compounds that modulate mutant ATXN3 related pathoge nesis. Recent data from our lab have shown that many aspects of MJD can be properly modeled in the round worm Caenorhabditis elegans. This study is based on the idea that our C. elegans MJD model is amenable for large scale drug screenings, in which the identification of effective drugs can be accomplished by looking simultaneously at protein aggregation in the live neuronal cells, and on its impact on neuron regulated behavior of the who le animal . Methods: We used our C. elegans MJD model to screen a library of ~1200 mainly FDA approved compounds for their ability to prevent or delay the formation of mutant ATXN3 aggregates and neurological dysfunc tion. Results: We excluded the small molecules that were found to be toxic or cause developmental delay to the C. elegans at the concentrations tested. Of the remaining, ten percent of the compounds significantly reduced the locomotion deficits of the animals. Discussion: We found that one group of the newly identified compounds exert their function in C. elegans by incre asing serotonin signaling.

Genome wide association studies have revealed out strong association signal for CDH10 gene with SNP rs4307059 and rs4327572. This gene had not been investigated for its association with Autism in South African population. Aim: In this study we aimed to investigate the associa tion of two SNPs (rs4307059 and rs4327572) of CDH10 gene of autism in the South African (SA) population. For SNPS rs4307059, the present study group was comprised of typed cases (188, unrelated autistic children) and typed controls (212, unrelated healthy children) where the respective figu res for rs4327572 were 72 and 209 respectively. The Taqman ÃÂ®Real Time PCR and genotyping assay was utilized to determine the genotypes. Results: There was no significant association of SNP rs4307059 and4327572 with autism in the South African (SA) population. Conclusion: There might be a possible role of CDH10 in autism but we need to validate it with a larger sample number. The present study represents the first report on study of genetic association of CDH10 gene in SA population.",2014
21543,"Autism spectrum disorder is a neuropsychiatric developmental disorder characterized by communication difficulties and impaired social interac tion. The anhydrolase domain containing 11 gene (ABHD11 ) is located on 7q11.23 which is a hotspot region for autism and ABCA13 maps to chromo some 7p12.3 in which multiple rare coding variants are observed. The aim of this study was to investigate the association of SNPs from genes ABHD11 (rs2293484 and rs10279013) and ABHD13 (rs17060) with haplotype ana lysis in South African autistic population. A total of 435 individuals were recruited including 197 autistic and 213 control subjects. The Taqman ÃÂ®Re al Time PCR and genotyping assay was used to determine the genotypes. A significant association of SNP rs10279013 with autism in the South African population is observed. Haplotype analysis with three SNPs revealed that the frequency of CGC, TGT and TCT haplotypes is significantly higher in con trols than cases (p<0.05). The haplotypes TGC and TCC presented a signi ficantly higher frequency in cases and the odds documented nearly 3 3.47 fold higher risk to the disease in carriers of the haplotypes [OR,3.0 (1.16 7.79), OR,3.47 (0.95 12.63), respectively]. In conclusion there is a role of various haplotypes of these SNPs in increasing susceptibility to autism for South African populations. The present study represents the first report on haplotype analysis on these SNPs in a SA population.",2014
21544,"We studied two monozygotic twins (II 1 and II 2), born to first cousin parents (I 1 and I 2), affected by a multisystem disease. Since birth they presented with cryptorchidism, dysmorphism (short arms, hypotelorism) and short stature. In the adulthood they suffered of an ataxic syndrome with cognitive decline, pyramidal signs and depression; dilatative cardiomyopa thy was also observed. We performed an exome sequencing analysis on one proband (II 1) and his unaffected sister (II 3). First we filtered out common variants (>0.1% in public databases); then we selected non synonymous variants that were homozygous only in II 1, based on a hypothesized re cessive trait and on the known consanguinity of the parents. The remaining 28 gene variants were prioritized according to the predicted deleterious outcome of the corresponding amino acid substitutions. The most severe variant was the nucleotide change c.673C>T in the gene XRCC4, predicted to create a stop codon (p. R225*) causing the synthesis of a truncated pro tein; this variant segregated within the family. Quantitative PCR on cDNA extracted from patientsÃ¢ÂÂ fibroblasts revealed that the XRCC4 transcript level was strongly reduced, probably due to mRNA decay. Functional assays after gamma ray irradiation demonstrated a reduction in DNA repair efficiency in mutant cells. These are the first patients reported with XRCC4 mutations. XRCC4 protein has a role in double strand DNA repair processes; mutations affecting other proteins with a role on DNA repair (SCAN1, AOA1, ATM) have been associated with peculiar forms of ataxia, suggesting an important role for DNA repair in the nervous system, in particular in the cerebellum.",2014
21545,"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal neurodegenerative disorder characterized by a degeneration of upper and lower motor neurons, lea ding to a progressive muscle weakness, wasting and paralysis that results in death within a few years from disease onset. Moreover, evidences of ALS as a multisystem disorder also compromising frontotemporal functions in up to 50% of patients are reported. Recently, a hexanucleotide repeat expansion (GGGGCC) in the first intron of C9ORF72 gene was identified as the most common genetic cause of familial ALS, frontotemporal dementia and ALS FTD. Aim of the present study was to determine the prevalence of C9ORF72 repeat expansion in our cohort of 753 ALS patients. C9ORF72 expansion was analyzed by using the repeat primed PCR: this method can detect re peat numbers of approximately maximum 60 and it is able to discriminate the repeat range detected in the normal population (0 20) from the higher mutated range (Ã¢ÂÂ¥30). The expansion, in the pathogenic range (Ã¢ÂÂ¥30), was identified in 34 ALS patients (4.5%); moreover, 4 cases (0.5%) resulted to be carriers of an intermediate number of reapets (20 30). Interestingly, 2 of the C9ORF72 expansion carriers also carried a causative mutations in one of other known causative genes of ALS (TARDBP and FUS). Our findings, in agreement with literature, suggest that C9ORF72 repeat expansion is the major genetic cause of ALS. Further efforts are needed to implement, in terms of intra and inter laboratory reproducibility, the method used for C9ORF72 analysis for using it in diagnostics.

21546,"Avogadro, Dept of Health Sciences, Novara, Italy, 2Department of Neurology, A. Avogadro University and Maggiore della Carita` Hospital, Novara, Italy. Large expansions of a noncoding hexanucleotide G4C2 repeat in the C9orf72 gene have been identified as the main cause of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclero sis (ALS) accounting for about 40% of the familial and 7% of the sporadic cases. The c9orf72 G4C2 repeat is contiguous with another GC rich region with imperfect repeats. A recent study observed heterozygous deletions of variable size (from 5 to 23 bp) in patients carrying a G4C2 expansion (about 37% in a Belgian cohort and 24% in an European cohort). These deletions are contiguous to the G4C2 repeat and create one long imperfect G4C2 re peat that could make this sequence prone to replication slippage. To confirm the role of these deletions, as a possible trigger event of the instability of G4C2 repeats, we sequenced the adjacent GC rich region in 28 Italian ALS patients carrying c9orf72 expansion, , as described by the original study. We did not observe any deletion of the GC rich region adjacent to G4C2 repeat in the Italian c9orf72 expanded cohort, although we expected at least 7 de leted cases since the deletion frequency in the European cohort was 24% (FisherÃ¢ÂÂs exact test, two tailed P value , 0.0102). We cannot exclude that our data could be population specific or due to technical artefacts. Further studies will be necessary to confirm the role of these deletions in c9orf72 genomic instability.",2014

Recessive mutations in ANO5 gene have been reported in patients suffe ring from limb girdle muscular dystrophy (LGMD) 2L, distal myopathy re sembling Miyoshi myopathy and patients manifesting with mialgia and high CK levels. ANO5 gene, located on chromosome 11p14, is composed of 22 exons. To date, forty different mutations have been described in the literature, being c.191dupA the most frequent mutation. Interestingly, previous studies show considerable geographical differences regarding the prevalence of ANO5 mutations. LGMD2L is the second most common form of LGMD in Northern Europe, in contrast to the low prevalence (2%) that has been reported in the Italian cohort of LGMD patients. We present data from an ANO5 gene molecular study in 27 Spanish patients manifesting the three different phenotypes: 1) LGMD 2L, 2) distal myopathy resembling Miyoshi myopathy, 3) mialgia and high CK levels. We identified six different mutations, two of them not previously described, in ten indivi duals (8 males and 2 females). Six patients presented 2 mutations and 4 only 1, suggesting symptomatic carrier status. Among patients presenting two mutations, six of them carried the c.191dupA : three in homozygous state, 2 in compound heterozygous state and one as a single mutation. In our cohort of patients, c.191dupA is, as in the majority of populations, the most frequent ANO5 mutation. Our mutational screening reveals a higher prevalence of ANO5 mutations in Spanish population compared to the Italy cohort of patients previously reported.",2014
21548,"of General Pathology, Naples, Italy. Dystrophin, the protein product of DMD gene is a rod shaped protein consi sting of 3684 amino acids composed by four domains: actin binding domain; central rod domain; cysteine rich domain and carboxy terminal domain. Mutations in DMD gene cause phenotypes ranging from severe (DMD) to mild (BMD) myopathic form or X linked cardiomyopathy (XLCM). Mutations causing premature translation termination result in a total absence of the protein that leads to DMD, while mutations derived from in frame deletions result in a reduced protein expression leading to BMD or XLCM. We investigated the percentage of patients sharing mutations in the rod do main in a cohort of 160 BMD patients with gene deletions, followed at the Cardiomyology and Medical Genetics of Naples Second University. We found that 20 of them (12.5%) shared a deletion involving exons from 45 to 57, at the 17 22 repeats level. From a clinical point of view, based on muscular, cardiac and respiratory as sessment, 8 (40%) were asymptomatic, 11 (55%) had a mild phenotype and only 1 (5%) had dilated cardiomyopathy, as the first manifestation. Compared with data reported by Kaspar et al. (2009), the percentage of asymptomatic patients in our cohort was higher (40 vs 8%) while that of patients with mild phenotype was lower (89 vs 11%). The difference pro bably lies in a younger mean age of our patients in both groups (30.5 vs 20.2 and 24.3 vs 30.5, respectively). Data here reported confirm that mutations involving repeats 17 22 of the rod domain result in a late onset mild Becker Dystrophinopathy.",2014
21549,"Charcot Marie Tooth (CMT) disease is the most common inherited neuro muscular disorder and is characterized by large locus heterogeneity. Muta tions in the GDAP1 gene show phenotypic and Mendelian heterogeneity in CMT patients. GDAP1 is a mitochondrial outer membrane protein related to mitochondrial dynamics network and different effects on the fission and fusion pathways have been reported for recessive and dominant mutations, respectively. Recently we have described the role of GDAP1 in the regula tion of store operated calcium entry (SOCE), a complex process needed to fill endoplasmic reticulum (ER) after Ca 2+ release. Dysregulation of calcium processes and ER stress represent a common pathway in neurodegenerati ve diseases. Here we present how missense mutations of GDAP1 expressed in the human neuroblastoma SH SY5Y cells also affect calcium homeostasis depending of their mode of inheritance and its relative position in the pro tein. Recessive mutations within the protein interaction domain of GDAP1 blocks Ca 2+ influx during SOCE avoiding ER Ca2+ refilling, while dominant mutations show an exacerbated Ca2+ influx with high resting Ca2+ levels. These mechanisms may affect the proper function of ER, which produce ER stress that eventually could lead to neurodegeneration.",2014

With the aim to reveal the genetic defect in 30 CM patients, in whom mutations in suspected genes have been previously excluded, we carried out whole exo me sequencing. Recently, a homozygous missense mutation in STAC3 gene was identified in patients with Native American myopathy. Analysis of WES data in our cases identified a homozygous STAC3 mutation in a patient with King Denborough syndrome and core like changes on muscle biopsy. A se cond patient with a severe phenotype and muscle biopsy changes suggestive of nemaline myopathy, carried a homozygous missense mutation in KLHL40. Mutations in KLHL40 have been very recently identified as a frequent cause of severe nemaline myopathy. Two heterozygous truncating TTN mutations were detected in a patient with severe cardiomyopathy and muscle biopsy suggestive of a centronuclear myopathy (CNM), supporting the emerging data that TTN mutations should be investigated as causative in cases with unresolved CNM.

21553,"Desmin is a muscle specific intermediate filament protein, which forms a network connecting sarcomere, T tubules, sarcolemma, nuclear membrane, mitochondria and other organelles. DES mutations cause myofibrillar myo pathies, cardiomyopathies and related phenotypes. Molecular mechanisms of the changes leading to the disease remain ambiguous. Here we describe DES mutations found in the Polish population. The study group comprised 22 individuals representing 7 families with cli nical diagnosis of desminopathy. DNA was extracted from peripheral blood using standard methods. Sanger sequencing identified one novel mutation (Q348P) and one previously described (A357_E359del) in the Polish popu lation. Both mutations were predicted pathogenic using PolyPhen 2, SIFT and PROVEAN software. A common ancestry of A357_E359del found in the novel and previously reported families was confirmed. To test whether the mutations affect DES expression and intracellular distribution in vitro ana lyses of quadriceps muscle biopsies were performed. Western Blotting re vealed elevated desmin level in the patientsÃ¢ÂÂ muscles. The increased expres sion was confirmed using immunostaining. Abnormal localization of desmin with aggregates within the fibers was also observed. Additional staining for M cadherin, ÃÂ± actinin and MHCs confirmed severe disruption of myofibril lar organization. Abnormalities were more prominent for the Q348P muscle which additionally displays numerous centrally localized nuclei in the aber rant muscle fibers. Based on the in silico and ex vivo analyses, Q348P and A357_E359del mu tations may be assumed pathogenic.

21555,"Dystrinopathies are inherited muscular dystrophies with mutations in DMD gene which contains 79 exons and is the largest human gene. DMD encodes Dystrophin protein and is the only gene responsible for the spectrum of dys trinopathies. Genotype analysis has indicated that deletions of one or more exon account for ~65% of all cases, while 5 10% are in frame or out frame duplications and the remaining 30% of affected individuals may have point mutations, small deletions or insertions within the gene. In the present stu dy, two patients diagnosed with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) are investigated. Multiple ligation dependent probe amplification (MLPA) ana lysis which detects up to 98% of all deletions and duplications in DMD gene did not reveal any large rearrangement in these patients. Further investi gation with application of two different techniques led to identification of two novel small deletions in DMD gene. In the first patient, all coding as well as flanking intronic regions of the dystrophin gene were PCR amplified fol lowed by sequencing and a hemizygous novel deletion, c.650 16_653del20 (p.

Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy has been associated with reduc tion of the number of D4Z4 repetitive elements at 4q35. FSHD is characteri zed by great clinical variability within families in which D4Z4 reduced allele (DRA) segregates. An increasing number of cases are sporadic with no other affected relatives and several findings suggest that additional factors (gene tic modifiers) might modulate FSHD expression. Thus molecular diagnosis, prognosis and genetic counseling have become more challenging. To gain additional information on the complexity of FSHD, we tested 40 FSHD pati ents belonging to families with reduced penetrance by testing, a broad core panel of 93 genes involved in myopathies (Motorplex). This Next Generation Sequencing based workflow permit the analysis of 2,544 exons. We studied 40 samples from FSHD patients belonging to families in which other DRA carries are healthy. In all subjects we found putative pathogenic variations in genes causing different myopathies. In addition to DRA, all patients car ried at least one damaging variations in other disease genes. These variants, if they had been detected alone in the context of a single gene testing, would have been considered as causative. The high number of damaging mutati ons identified in each sample support the hypothesis of Ã¢ÂÂmultiple factorsÃ¢ÂÂ leading to the FSHD phenotype. In conclusion, the use of a reliable, sensitive and specific method has been able to identify putative pathogenic mutations that can explain the variable penetrance of DRA. Importantly these large set of mutations observed in FSHD patients highlight the genetic complexity that might contribute to the disease expression.",2014

Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy has been genetically linked to reduced numbers (Ã¢ÂÂ¤8) of D4Z4 repeats at 4q35. Typically a rough inverse correlation between the number of repetitive elements and disease severity is accepted. Particularly severe FSHD cases have been associated with D4Z4 reduced alleles with 1 3 repeats (1 3 DRA) with some presenting ancillary features such as Coats like retinopathy, facial diplegia, hypoacusia, epilepsy and cognitive impairment. Out of 110 probands from the INRF carrying 1 3 DRA, we identified 40 index cases carrying a de novo DRA and 26 with at least one relative carried the same DRA. In order to investigate the earliest signs of disease and access the information about addition clinical conditi on, we designed an Anamnestic Infantile Form (AIF). Thirty six probands (54.6%) showed an early disease onset (within 10 years): among them, 26 cases (72.2%) were de novo and 10 (27.8%) were familial. Collectively our study reveals that congenital form is not present in the group of 1 3 DRA carriers and infantile disease onset is more common among de novo cases.

Single cell embryos were injected with morpholinos to knockdown hpse2. Immu nostaining was performed using an antibody raised to Xenopus heparanase 2 and imaged by laser confocal micrsoscopy, and protein levels were as sessed by western blotting. Results: Frog embryos showed increased hpse2 soon after gastrulation, with expression maintained through organogene sis. Using hspe2 morpholinos caused a phenotype comprising a bent tail, proctodeal/cloacal protrusion and impaired swim response. In wildtypes heparanase 2 localised in nascent skeletal muscle, and morphants had im paired muscularisation. Heparanase 2 was also expressed in the neural tube and hindbrain, and morphants showed compromised neural outgrowths from these structures. Intruigingly heparanase 2 was found to co localise with activated ERK (pERK) in the embryonic neural tube, and analysis of the morphants by western blot showed increased levels of pERK, suggesting altered regulation of key signalling pathways.

All samples were sequenced in paired end with 72 bp length reads on Il lumina Genome Analyser IIX. In accordance to a compound heterozygous model of inheritance, we identified in the proband three non synonymous heterozygous variants in N RAP gene: one predicted extremely damaging was inherited from her father and the other two less damaging from her mo ther. The mutation inherited from her father is very rare (MAF,0.0005) and causes an aminoacidic substitution in a domain essential for organizing ac tin filaments during myofibrillar assembly. The mutations from her mother cause aminoacidic substitutions in a domain critical for the Z line assembly. Immunohistochemistry showed reduced N RAP expression in the probandÃ¢ÂÂs muscle biopsy compared to a control. The muscle specific N RAP protein scaffolds I Z I assembly during myofibrillogenesis and has a LIM domain. This is the first exome approach to a BAG3 myopathy and suggests a contri bution of a LIM domain protein to the complex phenotype of the proband.",2014

In myopathic patients molecular diagnosis is hampered by the genetic he terogeneity and the clinical interpretation of molecular findings are further hindered by the presence of low penetrant variations and by the effect of modifier genes. To gain a comprehensive view of all sequence variants in patients, we developed a broad core panel of 93 genes involved in myopa thies. To analyze their 2,544 exons, we have developed a Next Generation Sequencing based workflow, based on a Haloplex custom enrichment stra tegy (Motorplex). We studied 200 samples from myopathic patients with prevalent limb girdle muscle involvement and 150 samples with congenital myopathies. In about 20% of patients we found typical causative mutations, while in an additional 30% other putative pathogenic variations were de tected. In addition to the causes of monogenic disorders, we also discovered more than 35% of patients showing damaging variations in other disease genes. These variants, if they had been detected alone in the context of a sin gle gene testing, would have been considered as causative. The high number of damaging mutations identified in each sample support the hypothesis of Ã¢ÂÂmultiple troublesÃ¢ÂÂ leading to a such complex phenotype. In conclusion, in a large cohort of patients with non specific symptoms, our reliable, sensitive and specific method has been able to identify pathogenic mutations, despi te of the heterogeneous conditions, improving significantly the diagnostic yield. Finally, intrafamilial and interfamilial phenotypic variability of pati ents sharing the same pathogenic mutations must be reevaluated conside ring the comprehensive view of all sequence variants.

All patients showed type 1 muscle fiber predominance and hypotrophy of type 2 fibers. Tubular aggregates of the sarcoplasmatic reticulum were abundant. In all three patients, de novo heterozygous mutations were iden tified in the Stromal Interaction Molecule 1 gene, STIM1. In one of the pati ents, the mutation was identified by exome analysis, coupled to a hypothe sis driven filtering strategy. Two patients harbored the previously described c.326A>G p.

Besides, the tubular aggregates, autophagic debris and myophosphorylase deficiency were do cumented in patientsÃ¢ÂÂ muscle cells. Consistent with previous findings, the c.326A>G change represent a recurrent mutation specifically related to ear ly onset muscle weakness.",2014
21565,"Myotonia congenita type Becker is an autosomal recessive nondystrophic skeletal muscle disorder primarily affecting lower limb muscles and later progressing to the arms, neck, and facial muscles. The disease is characteri zed by muscle stiffness and an inability of the muscle to relax after voluntary contraction. Sometimes muscle weakness may be transient. The autosomal recessive Becker type is caused by mutations in the CLCN1 gene, localized on chromosome 7q34 and encoding skeletal muscle chloride channel 1.Here we report 5 Bulgarian families genetically proved to carry muta tions in the CLCN1 gene. The following mutations were detected: non sense (p. Arg894*), splice site (c.1471+1G>A), missense (p. Val273Met; p. Tyr524Cys). Two additional nucleotide changes were detected in an asymptomatic individual (c.2284+5C>T possible splice site change and p. Phe167Leu). It was not possible to clarify, whether these changes are located on a single allele or affect both alleles. Two of the detected muta tions are interesting from population point of view. The missense substitu tion p. Val273Met was detected in a large Roma family with a high propor tion of endogamous marriages. Secondly, the novel missense substitution p. Tyr524Cys was detected in a large Bulgarian family with a number of affected individuals both in vertical and horizontal pedigree direction. The later family originates from a small Bulgarian village and the citizens tradi tionally marry within the village, which is very surprising for the Bulgarian habits.

In our previous study focused on the analysis of variability of the repetitive CCTG tract in the CNBP gene in patients with myotonic dystrophy symptoms and healthy population, we reported a patient harbouring an uninterrupted allele containing 34 CCTG repeats. Although there are several indications that it is not a causative allele in that patient, it was not possible to exclude its causality, until other candidate genes were screened for causative muta tions. Therefore the patientÃ¢ÂÂs DNA was sequenced by targeted resequencing approach using a custom panel and Ion Torrent PGM. After alignment to the GRCh37/hg19 reference sequence three homozygous single nucleoti de variations (SNVs) were identified. A missense variation p. S524G in the SCN4A gene (mutations of the gene are associated with paramyotonia con genita) and a missense variation p. G118W in the CLCN1 gene (mutations of the gene are associated with myotonia congenita) were found to be mi stakenly identified as variations, since according to the HapMap and 1000 Genomes Project data, the alleles harboured by our patient are in both ca ses the most common alleles and the reference sequence contains the rare variants (MAF,0,059 and MAF,0,009, respectively). The third SNV was a homozygous nonsense mutation p. P894* which is a known pathogenic mu tation leading to myotonia congenita (ThomsenÃ¢ÂÂs disease). Identification of a known homozygous CLCN1 mutation found by targeted resequencing led to conclusion that the previously identified possible DM2 grey zone allele is not a disease causing allele in the case of the reported patient with conse quence in the genetic testing in this family.",2014
21567,"Myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1), the most common adult muscular dys trophy, is caused by expansion of a CTG repeat in the 3Ã¢ÂÂUTR of the DMPK gene. Repeat size is correlated positively with phenotypic severity and nega tively with age of onset, with affected individuals classified as mild (50 150 CTGs), classic (100 1000 CTGs), or congenital (>1000 CTGs) DM1. Southern analysis reliably detects all expansions, but requires micrograms of DNA, yields approximate allele sizing, and is labor intensive, time consuming, and costly. PCR across the repeat accurately sizes all normal and also expan ded alleles, although the upper limit of detection is unknown. Newer triplet primed PCR (TP PCR) assays will detect all normal and expanded alleles, but product analysis by capillary electrophoresis (CE) is still costly when applied in high throughput screening situations where a majority of tested samples may be screen negative. We have now adapted the 5Ã¢ÂÂ and 3Ã¢ÂÂ TP PCR assays for single step detection of DM1 expansions by melting curve analy sis (MCA), wherein melt peak profiles from normal samples were distinctly different from samples carrying an expansion. In a blinded validation of 60 clinical samples enriched for affected individuals, a 48 repeat plasmid clone was used to establish a cut off temperature separating normal from affected samples, and 100% concordance with their known genotypes was achieved. We conclude that TP PCR MCA is an accurate yet simple, rapid and inex pensive screen useful for identifying DM1 expansion mutations. Follow up confirmation and sizing can be accomplished by capillary electrophoresis following a quick 5 cycle extension labeling of the positive TP PCR product.",2014
21568,"Myotonic Dystrophy type 1 (DM1) is the most common form of adult onset muscular dystrophy. Clinically, DM1 is a highly variable multisystemic disor der that primarily affects skeletal muscle and is characterized by progressi ve skeletal muscle weakness, wasting and myotonia. DM1 patients are dia gnosed using genetic tests and their muscle wasting progression is currently monitored through electromyography and regular physical examinations. Many scientific reports emphasize the importance for the discovery of non invasive serum based biomarkers for the diagnosis and therapy of diseases, since they are easily accessible and convenient. The identification of blood based biomarkers for DM1 would provide added value for the monitoring of the progressive muscle wasting. Scientific reports showed that circulating miRNAs are stably present within blood circulation and have the potential to be used as clinical biomarkers for many diseases. The aim of this pilot stu dy was to detect and evaluate the usefulness of miRNAs as biomarkers for DM1. DM1 patients and healthy participants were recruited and miRNA ana lysis was performed on RNA isolated from serum samples. Results show that the levels of particular miRNAs are elevated in the serum from DM1 patients compared to controls, presumably, as a consequence of the degradation of muscle tissue during muscle wasting. Moreover, the miRNA serum levels correlate with the progression of muscle wasting observed in the patients. Based on these results, we propose that miRNAs can be used as potential serum based molecular biomarkers for monitoring the progress of muscle wasting in DM1 patients.

21569,"Recently, new large mutations have been identified in the nebulin gene (NEB) causing nemaline myopathy (NM). NM constitutes a heterogeneous group of disorders among the congenital myopathies, and mutations in NEB are a main cause of the recessively inherited form. NEB consists of 183 exons and it includes a 32 kb triplicate region (TRI) where eight exons are repea ted three times. We have designed a custom NM CGH microarray to detect copy number variations in the currently known nine NM genes and one un published gene. To date, 230 samples from 170 families have been run with the NM CGH microarray and we have identified NEB TRI variation in appro ximately 14% of the NM families in this study cohort. The results suggest that the adjacent intronic repeat elements may predispose to the recurrent TRI variations. The possible pathogenicity of the TRI variations warrants further studies and elucidation of the exact breakpoints in each family. Mo reover, we have identified seven different, novel, large disease causing aber rations in NEB in seven different families. The size of the aberrations varies greatly, covering from only a part of one exon (0.9 kb) to more than half of the gene (133 kb). The NM CGH microarray method is currently available for mutation analysis in our laboratory. Additionally we have analyzed ten samples with exome sequencing and identified causative mutations for half of the families. We believe that the combination of the NM CGH microarray followed by exome sequencing will accelerate mutation detection and im prove the diagnostics of NM and related disorders.",2014
21570,"We evaluated the use of next generation sequencing to provide genetic diagnoses using a family trio consisting of healthy parents and an affected fetus which died intrauterine. The phenotype of the fetus was consistent with early onset neuromuscular disease. Suspected seizures, arthrogryposis multiplex congenita and suspected intrauterine epilepsy were detected in a sonography. We compared clinical gene panel analysis vs. whole exome sequencing (WES) for the family trio in order to identify candidate variants that account for the disease phenotype of the fetus. We used the TruSight TM One Sequencing Panel, which targets 4813 genes associated with known cli nical phenotypes, and the Nextera Exome Enrichment Kit (62Mb). Data was analyzed using an in house bioinformatics pipeline. We analyzed the 4813 disease associated genes in both sequencing approaches and found two compound heterozygous non synonymous substitutions in a gene that is involved in neuromuscular functioning. Extending the analysis to the whole exome did not provide any new candidate variants. Gene panel sequencing yielded higher quality and coverage results compared to the WES, which showed a higher number of uncovered nucleotides within the clinical genes. In addition, WES revealed many variants in genes which cannot be directed towards answering questions related to the medical conditions. As a diagno stic test, clinical gene panel sequencing including all relevant disease asso ciated genes was more efficient than WES by means of quality, costs, time and reporting. Although WES might not always lead to a direct diagnosis test, it is relevant for research to uncover new gene disease associations.",2014

MLPA was performed where appropriate, following customized target en richment and NGS. Identified mutations were validated using Sanger se quencing. All genes associated with the primary diagnosis were analyzed first. In unsolved cases our approach allows to expand the analysis to all remaining genes of the panel. In our study over 200 patients with NMD were analyzed. In 29% the underlying cause could be identified and in 20% likely pathogenic but unclear variants were detected. 52% of the cases remained unsolved. We observed clearly pathogenic mutations in 34 different genes, with CAPN3, MFN2 and TTN being the most frequently mutated genes, and unclear variants in additional 27 genes. Interestingly, in 7% of solved ca ses we could identify pathogenic mutations in genes not associated with the original diagnosis. We have developed a comprehensive diagnostic NGS panel to analyze the genetic basis of NMDs. As suspected, high genetic he terogeneity among patients could be shown in our cohort. Additionally, in a significant amount of cases we found evidence for new genotype phenotype correlations, emphasizing the usefulness of NGS panels for diagnostic pur poses.

Neuropathy target esterase (NTE) is the 6th member of 9 proteins of patatin like phospholipase domain containing proteins, PNPLA1 9.

The Swiss Cheese (SWS) protein is an ortholog of NTE in Drosophila and shares 39% sequence identify with human NTE. The Drosophila sws mutants are characterized by progressive degenerati on of adult nervous system, glial hyperwrapping, and neuronal apoptosis. Drosophila sws mutant thus provides an experimental model for functional studies of the SWS/NTE role in maintaining neural integrity. There is an evi dence of SWS role in the age dependent brain changes. However, possible disturbance caused by point mutations in sws gene in Drosophila larvae re mained unknown. The sws point mutants were used to investigate SWS localization and func tion in the nervous system of D.melanogaster larvae. We were shown SWS localization mainly in glial tissue of larvae brain as well as in glial cells, wrapped axons in all investigated lines. Presence of SWS was also obser ved in the postsynaptic membranes of the larval NMJ. SWS protein in small amount was also detected in larvae neurons. Quantitative and qualitative parameters of NMJ in all investigated sws mutants also were changed com paring with wild type flies.

We present here a novel case of a newborn boy with Rett syndrome caused by the de novo MECP2 frameshift mutation c.806delG. The clinical suspicion of male Rett syndrome was triggered by the rare combination of neonatal hypotonia and central bradypnoe. At the age of four days the newborn was transferred to the neonatal unit of a tertiary childrenÃ¢ÂÂs hospital because of poor suck, dysregulation of muscle tone and a pathological breathing pattern. On admission, the neonate was lethargic and the clinical examination showed multiple abnormalities, such as a severe brady /hypopnea with apneas of up to 30 seconds, followed by an arousal reaction, frequent yawning, axial hypotonia and hypertonia of the extremities. The cerebral magnetic resonance (MR) image revealed bilateral T2 signal hyper intensities of the white matter, especially in the temporal and parietal areas, which raised the question of perinatal asphyxia. In the spectroscopy the lactate was elevated and the n acetylaspartate level was low. The electroencephalogram (EEG) showed an immature activity with too many multifocal sharp transients.

SBMA is an androgen dependent disorder, with males with full disease ma nifestations, and females showing only mild symptoms even if homozygous for the mutation. While a correlation between expansion size of polyQ tract and disease severity has been reported, patients with the same number of CAG repeats have different age at onset and disease progression even if re latives.

21577,"Mutations in SCN1A gene are by far the most frequent cause of Dravet syn drome (DS) worldwide, with mutation prevalence approximately between 70 and 80%. One of the main features of DS is the fact that many patients do not respond well to the treatment with anticonvulsive drugs. Furthermore, there have been observations that some drugs, which function as sodium channel blockers, may induce aggravation of seizures in patient, thus wor sening their symptoms. As most of the DS SCN1A mutation result in trunca tion of the protein, the use of antiepileptic drugs would further decrease the inhibitory function in central nervous system. The aim of this study was to identify mutations in SCN1A gene in a broad testing group of patients with phenotypes raging from DS to milder phenotypes such as Genetic Epilepsy with Febrile Seizures Plus (GEFS+). Completing mutation screening in 37 unrelated patients, 4 causative mutations located in the coding region were identified. All mutations were found in DS patients and in accordance with previously identified disease variants, found mutations, of which three are novel, result in creation of a premature stop codon, either by substitution or an insertion and thus to a possible loss of function of the altered protein. In summary, our findings contribute to the broadening of the mutation spectrum of the SCN1A gene and enrich the clinical data of DS.

We report a 3 months old female with type I spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) born to a young and non consanguineous couple. Molecular analysis confir med the diagnosis of SMA with an homozygous deletion of SMN1. Parents analysis revealed that only the mother was a carrier of the SMA causative deletion. It is important to find out if the father, that carries two SMN1 co pies, has a CIS duplication of the gene on one chromosome bearing to a 2/0 genotype or the deletion occurred de novo during gametogenesis. Indeed, the risk for future pregnancies could be reduced from 25%, usually estima ted for SMA couple, to residual risk arising from recurrent de novo mutation (2% of the affected individual). Alternatively, the uniparental disomy (UPD) of the maternal deleted chromosome, with an estimated incidence of about 1:3500 live birth, must be taken into account. Gene dosage analysis of the fatherÃ¢ÂÂs relatives does not support a paternal 2/0 genotype. To discriminate between a paternal de novo mutation and a maternal isodisomy we analy zed in the affected infant and parents a total of nine microsatellite markers in a region spanning 3.0 Mb at the SMN locus. Five microsatellites at 5Ã¢ÂÂ/3Ã¢ÂÂ ends of that region demonstrate a maternal and paternal inheritance but could not definitively exclude the maternal segmental UPD. Finally, using a NGS approach we identify three paternal and one maternal inherited vari ants in the SMN2 genes of the infant.

In both, the molecular analysis revealed heterozygosity for the c.896G>A mutation in COL6A1 exon 10 (Gly299Glu) and for the COL6A1 c.1823 8G>A variation within COL6A1 intron 29. The Gly299Glu mutation, despite not previously reported, is likely to be pathogenic, leading to the disruption of the Gly Xaa Yaa motif in the triple helix domain of collagen VI alfa(1) chain. The intronic variation was inherited from the father and RNA analysis in skin fibroblasts allowed to exclude its role in affecting COL6A1 transcript processing. The Gly299Glu mutation occurred apparently de novo in the two sibs. The described mutational segregation strongly suggests the occurrence of paternal germline mosaicism , to be confirmed by mutational analysis of the sperm. The reported family represents the first observation of gonadal mo saicism in collagen VI related myopathies and, similarly to other collagen related diseases as osteogenesis imperfecta, this possibility deserve to be considered in genetic counseling and recurrence risk estimation.",2014

Case 1: Girl of 11 years with unexplained intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR), birth weight < 1.5 SD and persistent short stature (< 2.0 SD). She displayed dysmorphic features suggestive of Silver Russell Syndrome, with unspecific multiple hyperpigmented lesions on the body. She had a normal methylation study of the 11p15.5 region. Significant increases in IGF I levels were observe during two IGF I generation tests. SNP array analysis identi fied a heterozygous de novo 4,92 Mb deletion in15q26.2 including IGF1R gene. Case 2: proband was first evaluated at the age of 4 months for overgrowth, hypotonia and some dysmorphic features (a prominent nasal bridge, deep set eyes, epicanthic folds and micrognathia).

He had presented craniosynostosis, corrected at 3 months of age. Array CGH analysis showed a 17,3 Mb de novo duplication from 15q25.2 to 26.3 encompassing the IGF1R gene. Our two cases again demonstrate that overgrowth, craniosynostosis, ma crocephaly, and mild developmental delay in patients with trisomy 15q26.1 result from dosage increase of IGF1R, whereas gene dosage decrease of IG F1R can cause IGF1 resistance and underline IUGR with subsequent short stature.",2014

Partial deletions of 9p have been reported as a clinically recognizable syn drome characterised by the variable association of intellectual disability, speech delay, hypotonia, cardiac anomalies and dysmorphisms. We report a 3 years old girl with midface hypoplasia, downslanting palpe bral fissures, teeth agenesis and teeth fusions. Language was not acquired. At birth, severe neonatal hypotonia and patent ductus arteriosus were pre sent. Phenotype was consistent with the clinical diagnosis of Ã¢ÂÂ9p deletion syndromeÃ¢ÂÂ (OMIM#158170), with uncommon features such as bilateral ca taract (diagnosed at 5 months), chronic constipation, high pain threshold and poor temperature control. Karyotype analysis showed an apparent 9p deletion.

Subsequent FISH analysis revealed a 9p22.1p24.3 insertion in chromosome 2q [46,XX,ins(2;9)(q24.3;p22.1p24.3)dn]. The 2q microdeletion involved only two genes: SCN9A and SCN7A . SCN9A recessive mutations cause congenital insensitivity to pain. SCN7A is not associated with human disease, and in mouse is likely to be a sodium level sensor of body fluids in the brain. SCN9A haploinsufficiency may sup port the clinical observation of the patient high pain threshold and the poor temperature control. We are verifying the presence of a second mutation on the remaining allele. Assuming that the 2q deletion cannot account for the whole phenotype, we speculate that a critical gene/regulatory region key for the Ã¢ÂÂ9p deletion syndromeÃ¢ÂÂ is located in the 9p breakpoint(s). This pati ent deserves future studies that may help to refine 9p critical region.",2014

Short stature, microcrania, stigmata dyspla stica, nasal polyposis and hypermetropia. Head MR showed suspect hypo physeal calcinations. Normal feeding and voiding. Dry skin. Normal hearing. No cerebral paroxysms.

The deleted region contained 18 RefSeq genes, encom passing CHD2, ST8SIA2 and RGMA, among others. Background: So far, there has been no case with similar 15q26.1 deletion submitted to the publicly available databases1. CHD2 gene belongs to the CHD family of proteins, cha racterized by the presence of chromo (chromatin organization modifier) domains and SNF2 related helicase/ATPase domains. Moreover, ST8SIA2 and RGMA genes play an important role in developing and adult central ner vous system. Conclusion: Taking into consideration the de novo origin of the 15q26.1 deletion, its size and functional characteristics of the encompassed genes, the deletion is most likely associated with the developmental delay, dysplastic signs and multiple organ involvement. We believe phenotype is predominantly the consequence of CHD2 haploinsufficiency. Further stu dies are required to determine the role of CHD2 gene in the characteristic phenotype. 1Data generated by the ECARUCA, DECIPHER, ISCA",2014
21595,"Triple A (Achalasia Addisonianism Alacrima, Allgrove) syndrome is an in herited condition characterized by three specific features: achalasia, Addi son disease, and alacrima. Allgrove syndrome is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern and is caused by mutations in the AAAS gene localized at 12q13.13. The gene encodes a protein called ALADIN. It localizes to nuclear pore complexes, large multiprotein assemblies that are the sole sites of nu cleocytoplasmic transport. Achalasia Addisonianism Alacrima syndrome is a rare condition, incidence is unknown, and only scattered family and case reports are noted in the literature. Here we report a female patient with Triple A syndrome born to non consanguineous parents from Bulgarian ori gin. She was diagnosed as Triple A at the age of 17. The patient express a typical phenotype: achalasia, Addison disease, and alacrima. The affected patient also has muscle weakness, peripheral neuropathy, skin hyperpig mentation, optic atrophy and papillae atrophy. Many of the features of triple A syndrome are caused by dysfunction of the autonomic nervous system and the neurological symptoms have worsen over time. Molecular genetic testing of the patient showed 2 heterozygous mutations in the AAAS gene: an already reported nonsense mutation c.1024C>T , p.(Arg342*) and a novel splice site mutation c.1331+2dupT . The one basepair duplication, located 2 basepairs upstream exon 14, disrupts the donor splice site of intron 14 of the AAAS gene.

21596,"Acrocallosal syndrome (ALCS) is a multiple congenital anomaly disorder characterized by postaxial and/or preaxial polydactyly, cutaneous syndac tyly, macrocephaly, widely spaced eyes, absence of the corpus callosum, and intellectual disability. It was first described by Albert Schinzel in 1979, but the diagnosis of this syndrome still remains challenging. This may be due to both non specific clinical symptoms, as well as to a heterogeneous and difficult to clearly define molecular background. In 2011 mutations in the KIF7 gene were identified for the first time in patients with acrocallosal syn drome. The KIF7 gene encodes a cilia associated protein belonging to the kinesin family that plays a role in the hedgehog signaling (SHH) pathway through the regulation of GLI transcription factors; it also regulates acetyla tion and stabilization of microtubules. We report on a family with 2 children (a girl and a boy) affected with acro callosal syndrome caused by novel mutations in KIF7. The presented sibs met the clinical criteria of acrocallosal syndrome, i.e.: polydactyly, corpus callosum anomalies, facial dysmorphism (frontal bossing and hypertelo rism) and hypotonia/developmental delay. Despite the same spectrum of congenital malformations noted in the presented patients, their psychomo toric development is quite different. The boy is much more delayed, with poor contact, cannot sit unsupported. He has hyperventilation and, as his sister, sleep disorders (frequent awakening).

This condition is characterized by intellectual disability, hypogonadism, sensory neuropa thy and recurrent infections. Furthermore, decreased bone mineral density and low levels of 25 hydroxyvitamin D 3 were detected. Mutations in genes previously associated to acroosteolysis (NOTCH2, MMP2, WNK1 , FAM134B ) were excluded by Whole Genome Sequencing. This same technique, in com bination with SNP haplotyping of the pedigree, allowed the identification of two homozygous missense mutations in neighbouring genes TMEM41B and DENND5A on 11p15.4. These genes have not been implicated in human disease yet and encode distinct Golgi proteins. Different bioinformatic ana lyses suggest that both mutations in the neighbouring genes may underlie the pathogenesis. Messenger RNA levels of both genes are upregulated in osteoclast cell cultures obtained from normal controls. Functional studies show that significantly more osteoclasts are derived from patientsÃ¢ÂÂ blood mononuclear cells compared to heterozygous individuals and normal con trols; finally, patientsÃ¢ÂÂ osteoclasts exhibit an enhanced bone resorption acti vity compared to controls.

Probands were a 31 years female and his 37 years brother who were re ferred to our department due to suspected acromegaly. Both siblings had a previous history of oral surgery 13 and 20 years before due to hypertrophic intraoral tissue. Additionally, the male proband had mild learning difficul ties, uncontrolled hypertension, left ventricular hypertrophy and a paroxy stic atrial fluter.

Their facial appearance was coarse with thickened lips and superior eyelids, enlarged nose and gingival hypertrophy. Biochemical surveys were normal. At follow up both patients underwent repeated oral surgeries due to their evolving extensive gingival hypertrophy. AFA syndrome was considered the final diagnosis of this somatic overgrowth disease. We highlight the importance of a careful family history and physical exami nation of a kindred with AFA syndrome to collect the striking features of each disorder associated with an acromegaloid phenotype and achieve an accurate diagnosis.

His healthy non consanguineous parents are of Norwegian descent. Of note is that his father was icteric for the first 2 4 months of life. In the non dysmorphic index patient, hepatic ultrasound and scintigraphy were normal neonatally. Bile duct paucity, giant cell trans formation and intracanalicular cholestasis was evident histologically. Se rum cholesterol was <5mmol/L. His proteinuria improved over the first 12 months. Additional findings included posterior embryotoxon and bilateral mild peripheral pulmonary artery stenosis. Butterfly vertebrae were not de monstrated. No sequence or copy number variants were detected in JAG1. Sequencing of ABCB4 and CFTR revealed no pathogenic variant. Sequencing of NOTCH2 established heterozygosity for the novel synonymous variant c.2817G>A (p. P939P) (NM_024408.2) both in the child and his father. In silico analysis predicted introduction of a novel splice site. cDNA sequen cing confirmed the presence of a splice site causing skipping of the 5Ã¢ÂÂ end of exon 18 (r.2753_2818del). The deletion maintained the reading frame (p. Asn918 Gly940delinsSer), resulting in a protein lacking most of the 24 th EGF like domain (p.911 947). Amplification of the correctly spliced mRNA revealed monoallelic expression of the normal allele (c.2817G), confirming that c.2817G>A in NOTCH2 is likely the cause of the variable Alagille syndro me phenotype in this family.

The autosomal dominant Alport syndrome accounts for 5% of cases of Alport syndrome and, unlike the recesive and sex linked forms, clinical expression is benign and appears in the later stages of life. Autosomal dominant Alport syndrome generates a form of late onset mild sensorineural hipoacusia. Ho wever, as in the other forms of Alport syndrome, this is always accompanied by renal failure, the rate of hearing loss being directly linked to the progres sion of renal failure, and its progression suggests a poor prognosis of kidney disease. We have studied the COL4A3 and COL4A4 genes by PCR, CSGE and automatic sequencing of the full coding region and the exon intron bounda ries in a Spanish family with autosomal dominant Alport syndrome, in which most of its members are suffering from hearing loss only, one member suf fers lenticonus, and only two suffer renal disease. We found a heterozygous c.345DelG/p. G115GFSX37 mutation in the COL4A3 gene, which generates a truncated protein. This mutation was found in all family members with symptoms but was absent in the healthy members of the family. Thus, we describe a new mutation in COL4A3 gene mainly associated to hearing loss and for the first time we describe a case of autosomal dominant Alport syn drome that presents lenticonus.

Karyotype analysis has been the standard procedure for prenatal cytoge netic diagnosis since the 1970s. However, the major limitation remains requirement for cell culture, resulting in a delay of as much as 14 days to get the test results. FISH and QF PCR do not provide a genome screen for unexpected imbalances. CGH array technology has proven to be useful in postnatal diagnosis of mental retardation, development delay, and conge nital malformation syndrome. We evaluated the use of array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) for prenatal diagnosis including assessment of variants of uncertain significance, and the ability to detect abnormalities not detected by karyotype. Women undergoing amniocentesis or chorio nic villus sampling (CVS) for karyotype were offered aCGH analysis using a targeted cytochip ISCA 4x44K v1.0 oligonucleotide array. Parental samples were obtained at the same time to exclude maternal cell contamination and determine if copy number variants (CNVs) were de novo, or inherited. We analyzed 163 samples, most were CVS (75.5%) and amniotic fluid (19.6%). The most common indication were advanced maternal age (N,74), abnor mal ultrasound finding (N,46) and a previous child with multiple congeni tal abnormalities (N,40).We detected 27 CNVs (16.7%). Of these 16 (9.8%) were interpreted as likely benign, 9(5.5%) were of defined pathological si gnificance, while 2(1.2%) were of uncertain significance. We concluded that array CGH identified clinically significant abnormalities in approximately 5.5% of fetuses with ultrasonographic abnormalities and normal conventio nal karyotype. This study demonstrate the potential for array CGH to replace conventional cytogenetic in the great majority of prenatal diagnosis cases. ABSTRACTS POSTERS ESHG 2014 | MILAN, ITALY | WWW. ESHG.

21602,"of Medical Genetics, PÃÂ©cs, Hungary. Interstitial deletion of chromosome 9q is reported in context of many types of cancer but congenital cases are rarely published. The authors report on a child presenting with multiplex congenital anomalies, muscle hypotonia and characteristic facial features. Because of the symptoms suggesting primarily chromosomal disease, high resolution array CGH was indicated among a se ries of examinations, which detected a de novo 15,8 Mb interstitial deletion of 9q (ch9:102,589,027 118,400,548x1). The genotype phenotype analysis made it clear that there are many symptoms in the clinical picture which are not included in the description of similar cases as heart anomalies (patent foramen ovale and vitium), brain malformation (corpus callosum hypopla sia), and many minor anomalies. An excessive sweating and frequent falling asleep are also characteristics not reported at known 9q deletion patients. The analysis of the possible role of the genes affected by deletion drew our attention to NR4A3 and CTR1 which may be related to brain malformation. Two genes (CTNNAL1 and RAD23 ) involved in DNA repair and cell cycle re gulation may have also impact on the growth retardation and dysmorphic facial features observed in 9q deletion. The TNC may be a candidate in de velopment of the heart defects, and in the background of muscle hypotonia, the MUSK gene may be significant. Probably the haploinsufficiency of KLF4 might be associated with excessive sweating being present in our patient. The authors provide a detailed clinical report, and the possible pathogenic role of individual genes involved in the deletion will also be discussed.",2014

To date, two GNAI3 mutations in three families have been reported. Here we report an Australian patient with ACS with a novel de novo GNAI3 mutation. We also present two other novel GNAI3 mutations, one segregating with affected members in a family previously linked to 1p21.1 q23.3 and a de novo mutation in an unrelated simplex case. The mutations occur in known functional motifs common to G proteins and RAS family members. Structural modeling shows that all five mutated GNAI3 residues cluster in a region involved in GDP/GTP binding. Two of the five re sidues lead to dominant negative proteins when mutated in related proteins. We hypothesize that all GNAI3 mutations lead to dominant negative effects.",2014

We report a 15 years old male patient with clinical presentation of MCA syndrome including facial dysmorphism with micrognatia and small dyspla stic ears, absent lacrimal glands and limb anomalies (muscle hypotrophy and contractures of upper limbs, bilateral pes varus deformity). The boyÃ¢ÂÂs intellectual and growth development was in normal age ranges. The child was born from a second pregnancy of young and healthy couple. The first pregnancy in the family ended with birth of a baby with diaphragmatic her nia which died after three days. The performed cytogenetic analysis of the patient at one month revealed a microscopically balanced chromosomal translocation between chromosomes 5p and 14q: 46, XY, t(5;14)(p13;q22). The fatherÃ¢ÂÂs karyotype was normal 46,XY while the motherÃ¢ÂÂs karyotype was 46,XX,t(5;14)(p13;q22) identical with her sonÃ¢ÂÂs rearrangement. The per formed array CGH of the patient identified a heterozygous deletion in 5p12 chromosome with 489 kb size, including only one mapped gene: FGF10 (fibroblast growth factor 10) gene. Mutations in FGF10 gene may under lie autosomal dominant conditions such as lacrimo auriculo dento digital (LADD) syndrome and aplasia of lacrimal and salivary glands (ALSG). The main features of lacrimo auriculo dento digital (LADD) syndrome are ab normal tear production, malformed ears with hearing loss, decreased sali va production, small teeth, and hand deformities. The haploinsufficiency of FGF10 gene caused by heterozygous loss of on gene copy may explain the phenotype in our patient. This rare case of a cytogenetically balanced fami lial translocation causing abnormal phenotype demonstrates the diagnostic importance of genome analysis in patients with chromosomal rearrange ments detected on routine karyotype.",2014

Background: Bardet Biedl syndrome (BBS) (OMIM 209900) is a rare auto somal recessive, pleiotropic ciliopathy. To date, at least fifteen genes causing BBS have been reported. Case: A 26 year old Korean male from non consanguineous Korean parents presented with rod cone dystrophy, truncal obesity, mental retardation and end stage of renal disease. A 28 year old his brother showed rod cone dys trophy, truncal obesity, mental retardation and deep vein thrombosis. To rule out the BBS, genomic DNAs were obtained from the peripheral blood leukocytes of all the family members. All the exons and intron flanking re gions of the fifteen BBS genes were analyzed by direct sequencing. A com pound heterozygous mutation of BBS7 gene (NM_176824) was identified in both brothers; one was a novel acceptor splice site c.103 1G>A muta tion (IVS2 1G>A) altering the splicing recognition site at the intron 2 and exon 3 boundary of BBS7 gene. The other was a novel missense mutation of c.728G>A changing codon 243 from cysteine to tyrosine. The father was a heterozygous carrier for c.103 1G>A, and the mother was a heterozygous carrier for c.728G>A. Array comparative genomic hybridization analysis re vealed a normal hybridization pattern with no evidence of significant chro mosome imbalance. Conclusion: This is the first BBS case in Korean family genetically confirmed that had a compound heterozygous mutation in BBS 7 gene. Considering that the BBS is genetically heterogeneous and the prevalence differs among ethnic group, our clinical experience would be helpful to diagnose these pa tients accurately and understand the genetic events in BBS.

21607,"Bardet Biedl syndrome (BBS, #209900) is a rare genetic disorder characte rized by highly variable phenotype and genetic heterogeneity. BBS belongs to a group of diseases known as ciliopathies, which show partial overlapping phenotypes that further complicates the molecular diagnosis. BBS1 gene ac counts for 25% of total mutations described in BBS, of which p. M390R is the most frequent mutation in European population. Many efforts have been done to establish a genotype phenotype correlation for BBS genes in order to facilitate diagnosis confirmation. In this sense, the objective of this study was to correlate different BBS1 mutations with some clinical features. We selected 36 patients from 22 families for whom a BBS1 mutation had been identified. Clinical features of these patients were analysed by SPSS v.19. p. M390R mutation was the predominant mutation identified in 33 patients (92%), 20 of them harboured this mutation in homozygous state (56%) and 13 were compound heterozygous (36%). Only 3 patients (8%) had two mu tated alleles with BBS1 mutations different from p. M390R. By comparing all clinical features of these three groups of patients, we found statistically significant differences between these groups: while homozygous p. M390R showed more frequently high blood pressure, compound heterozygous manifested more secondary features, especially psychomotor impairment/ retardation, hearing loss and worse visual defects. In conclusion, we con firm the important role of p. M390R mutation in the diagnosis of BBS, and it seems that homozygous patients have a milder phenotype. This will be important for genetic counselling purposes in these families.",2014
21608,"Bardet Biedl syndrome (BBS, #209900) is a multisystem rare disease which belongs to the emerging group of diseases called ciliopathies, and is inheri ted within an autosomal recessive pattern. However, little is known about other molecular mechanisms which may be involved in BBS development. For example, it is well established that synonymous (sSNPs) and non synonymous (nsSNPs) changes can affect the conformation and stability of mRNA, the splicing process, the accuracy of translation and the protein structure. The former would lead to the disruption of the highly conserved network of cellular pathways for maintaining proteostasis. In addition, tho se exonic mutations predicted as pathogenic could affect splicing process via the creation and/or elimination of Exonic Splicing Enhancer/Silencer sequences (ESEs/ESSs).In this regard, we have sequenced the coding region and intron boundaries of BBS12 gene in fifty BBS patients. Then, we have used specific software tools to predict the potential effect at protein level (PolyPhen, PMut and SIFT) or on the splicing process (NetGene2, NNsplice, SpliceView, Human Splicing Finder and Rescue ESE) of all variants identified. We have found two pathogenic mutations in six patients and found at least one sequence variation in twenty nine of them. Eight out of twenty changes were selected as putative to affect the splicing process since at least two software tools predicted this effect. As these results are only computational predictions, further functional stu dies will have to confirm this effect on mRNA processing. Thus, minigenes and RNA assays will be performed in order to elucidate the role of these changes.",2014

Variability in cognitive, social, and emo tional impairment is reported; however, studies were small and completed prior to availability of molecular characterization. Our aim is to define neu ropsychological function in a group of patients with molecular diagnosis of BBS to better understand phenotypic variability. Methods: Eighteen patients (12 females; mean age: 20.95 years; range 6.4 38 years) completed standardized measures of cognition. Magnification was available. Standardized informant proxy questionnaires were completed to assess behavioural and adaptive functioning. Results were compared to nor mative data (norms). Results: Significant weaknesses (p<.001) in verbal and perceptual intellec tual reasoning emerged compared to norms (mean, 8th and 3rd percentiles respectively; range < 2nd 53rd percentiles). More individuals displayed Ave rage ability (25th 74th percentile) on verbal (33.3%) than visual (15.4%) do mains. More individuals displayed Extremely Low ability (<2nd percentile) on visual (53.9%) than verbal (11.1%) domains. Significant weaknesses in auditory attention span (p<.01), and auditory and visual working memo ry (p<.001) emerged.

In addition to this clinical heterogeneity, BWS also exhibits etiologic mole cular heterogeneity involving a variety of genetic and/or epigenetic alterati ons in growth regulatory genes on chromosome 11p15. The clinical hetero geneity turns out to be insufficient in diagnosis and prognosis of BWS, thus the need of genetic analysis of 11p15 region. We conducted a study of 9 patients who underwent molecular analysis of chromosome 11p15 region. Reasons of referral vary from sporadic typical presentation encompassing abdominal wall defects, macroglossia and gi gantism to atypical mild familial BWS revealed by isolated benign adreno cortical tumor.

Clinical findings include macrosomia, macroglossia, abdominal wall defects and other less frequent features, the most severe of which is predisposition to embryonal tumors. The molecular etiology of BWS is complex, involving alterations in the ex pression of multiple imprinted growth regulatory genes on chromosome 11p15.5. Genes that are imprinted are expressed predominantly from one allele in a parent of origin specific manner. Epigenetic and/or genetic al terations in the 11p15.5 imprinted gene cluster have been associated with BWS in approximately 80% of patients. One of the major categories of BWS molecular alteration (20% of cases) is represented by mosaic paternal uniparental disomy (pUPD), namely patients with two paternally derived copies of chromosome 11p15 and no maternal contribution. pUPD is also the molecular alteration associated with the most severe BWS phenotype because of the highest tumor risk. Here we report a fine analysis of patients with BWS and pUPD from our co hort.

In the current study, hot spot mutations of PIK3CA were identified in six patients presenting with CLOVES syndrome. Analysed tissues included epidermal nevi, skin, fatty tissues, and connective tissue. Blood was available from five patients. Molecular analysis was per formed for all six patients by Sanger sequencing. Mutant allele ratios of 30 ABSTRACTS POSTERS ESHG 2014 | MILAN, ITALY | WWW. ESHG. ORG 213Back to inde x 50% were observed in scrapings from epidermal nevi or affected fatty tis sue samples. In none of the blood samples PIK3CA mutations were detected. Because detection levels and quantification of mutant alleles were limited to 10 15% by Sanger sequencing, fragment analysis and amplicon deep se quencing on a GS Junior platform (Roche) were applied. This increased the mutant allele detection to 1 5%. In blood samples mutant allele ratios were 2% or less. Our data confirm that cells from affected tissue are essential for mutation analysis in CLOVES syndrome whereas blood is an inappropriate source. Improved detection methods may be required for other tissues with low level somatic mosaicism.",2014
21622,"Coffin Siris syndrome (CSS) is a rare congenital anomaly syndrome (MIM135900), characterized by developmental delay with severe speech impairment, growth deficiency , coarse facial features, hypertrichosis, hy poplastic/absent fifth fingernails or toenails. Some CSS patients have mild microcephaly and hypoplasia/agenesis of the corpus callosum. In 2012 Santen et al. showed that haploinsufficieny of ARID1B gene cau ses CSS and Tsurusaki et al. demonstrated that CSS can be due to de novo germline heterozygous mutations in one of five SWI/SNF subunit genes SMARCB1,SMARCA4, SMARCE1, ARID1A and ARID1B. We describe a girl of four years of age, first daughter of healthy unrelated parents. She was born by caesarean section for IUGR, at 39 wks of preg nancy. Out first examination at the age of 18 months showed psycho motor delay with absent language. Her weight, length and OFC were between 25th and 50th centile for age, but her facial and extremities features were sugge stive of CSS. She had marked body hypertrichosis and moderate, non fami lial, joint laxity, usually not described in CSS phenotype. Array CGH analysis revealed a de novo 1,3 Mb interstitial deletion in 6q25.3, including ARID1B gene, Because few hormonal data in CSS have been reported so far, we performed an extensive endocrinological study. Biochemical measurements showed normal values of electrolytes, venous blood gas, creatinine, glucose, fT4,TSH, aldosterone, renin activity,1 OH progesterone, DHEAS, cortisol, ACTH and normal slow response of cortisol and 17 OH progesterone to ACTH test. These results suggest that pituitary adrenal axis anomalies are not respon sible for hypertrichosis in CSS.",2014
21623,"Cohen syndrome (CS) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder with multisy temic clinical features due to mutations in the VPS13B gene, which has re cently been described encoding a mandatory membrane protein involved in Golgi integrity. As the Golgi complex is the place where glycosylation of newly synthesized proteins occurs, we hypothesized that VPS13B defici ency, responsible of Golgi apparatus disturbance, could lead to glycosyla tion defects and/or mysfunction of this organelle, and thus be a cause of the main clinical manifestations of CS. The glycosylation status of CS serum proteins showed a very unusual pattern of glycosylation characterized by a significant accumulation of agalactosylated fucosylated structures as well as asialylated fucosylated structures demonstrating a major defect of glycan maturation in CS. However, CS transferrin and ÃÂ±1 AT profiles, two liver de rived proteins, were normal. We also showed that ICAM 1 and LAMP 2, two highly glycosylated cellular proteins, presented an altered migration profile on SDS polyacrylamide gels in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from CS patients. RNA interference against VPS13B confirmed these glyco sylation defects. Experiments with Brefeldin A demonstrated that intracel lular retrograde cell trafficking was normal in CS fibroblasts. Furthermore, early endosomes were almost absent in these cells and lysosomes were abnormally enlarged, suggesting a crucial role of VPS13B in endosomal lysosomal trafficking. Our work provides evidence that CS is associated to a tissue specific major defect of glycosylation and endosomal lysosomal traf ficking defect, suggesting that this could be a new key element to decipher the mechanisms of CS physiopathology.",2014
21624,"The distal arthrogryposis (DA) are characterized by congenital contractu res of two or more different body areas without a main neurological and/ or muscle disease. Currently, DAs are subdivided into 10 types, depending on the number and nature of additional features. DA5 is unique among DAs because, in addition to contractures, affected individuals have ocular abnormalities. These abnormalities include ptosis, ophtalmoplegia, and/or strabismus. Recently, it has been shown that a subtype of DA5 that includes restrictive pulmonary disease is caused by gain of function mutations in the mechanically activated cation channel PIEZO2. We report 14 years old boy with DA5 who initially presented with multiple contractures at the age of 2 months. The main clinical findings included pitosis, ophtalmoplegia, mi crognathia, clinodactyly, pectus excavatum, recurrant pulmonary infections, operated inguinal hernia/midpenil hypospadias, elbow extansion/bilatera ly wrist supination restriction, knees lightly in flexion moode and pes val gus. Sequencing of the PIEZO2 gene in the proband revealed a de novo one base pair deletion in Exon 52 of PIEZO2, which results in a frameshift muta tion (c.8208delA). The mutation leads to a p. Y2737Ifs*7 change within the C terminal domain of PIEZO2. Recently electrophysiologic studies of E2727del variant showed that mechanically activated current inactivation were clearl ly slower and E2727del channels spend about two fold less time in an inacti vated state following mechanical stimulation than in wild channels, thus can be reactivated quicker. Therefore because our pathologic variant is at the same domain as E2727del, it can be speculated that increased response to mechanical force may explain the phenotype of our patient also.",2014
21625,"Congenital Hernia of the Diaphragm (CDH) and Esophageal Atresia with/or without Trachea esophageal Fistula (EA/TEF) are congenital anomalies that can either be present as isolated anomaly or in association with other birth defects. Both anomalies likely have a multifactor etiology, are asso ciated with known (genetic) syndromes and can occur in combination with specific chromosomal aberrations, Copy Number Variations (CNV) or mu tations. When evaluating the genetic component of a disease twin studies help to elucidate potential causal or predisposing genetic factors. Monozy gotic (MZ) twins are believed to have the same genetic content and share the same environment during development. We hypothesize that de novo muta tions arisen early in embryonic development could explain the phenotypi cal differences in discordant MZ twins. In total of six EA/TEF and four CDH discordant MZ twins are characterized with SNP arrays and exome NGS in order to detect, complete or mosaic, DNA discrepancies.

21626,"BACKGROUND: Although the majority of congenital heart defects (CHD) occur in isolation, a significant number varying in previous reports from 6 to 66% occur with noncardiac anomalies. The purpose of this investigation was to assess the prevalence and the types of associated anomalies in in fants with CHD in a defined population. METHODS: The associated anoma lies in CHD were collected during 26 years in 346,831 consecutive births of known outcome. RESULTS: Of the 4005 infants with CHD (116 per 10,000), 1055(26.3 %) had associated anomalies. There were 354 (8.8%) patients with chromosomal abnormalities including 253 trisomies 21, and 99 (2.5%) nonchromosomal recognized dysmorphic conditions. There were no predo minant recognised dysmorphic conditions, but VA(C)TER(L) association. However, other recognised dysmorphic conditions were registered inclu ding Di George and Noonan syndromes. 15.0 % of the patients had multiple congenital anomalies, non syndromic, non chromosomal (MCA). Anomalies in the musculoskeletal, the urinary tract, the digestive, and the central ner vous systems were the most common other anomalies. CONCLUSIONS: The overall prevalence of associated anomalies, which was one in four infants, emphasizes the need for a thorough investigation of infants with CHD. The most commonly associated major noncardiac anomalies involved the mus culoskeletal system, followed by the urinary, the digestive, and the central nervous systems. A routine screening for other anomalies may be conside red in infants and in fetuses with CHD. One should be aware that the ano malies associated with CHD can be classified into a recognizable anomaly syndrome or pattern in one out of nine infants with CHD.",2014

Although the etiology for the majority of cases remains elusive, there are several lines of evidence, that de novo copy number variations (CNVs) represent a major genetic contributor. Here we array based molecular karyotyping in a large cohort of 174 BEEC patients, aiming to identify disease related de novo CNVs. For array based molecular karyotyping we used the Illumina HumanOmniExpress 12v1.1 bead chip, comprising a total number of 719,665 markers. All genotype data were analyzed by QuantiSNP using an Objective Bayes Hidden Markov model. To narrow down the computed number of 13,828 putative CNVs, we used different filter criteria and implemented various procedures for data analysis. In total, 17 putative disease related CNVs ranging from 2,52 kb to 6,08 Mb in size, including one duplication in the Cat eye syndrome relevant region (22pter 22q11.21) remained.

Cornelia de Lange syndrome (CdLS) is a neurodevelopmental disorder caused by mutations in either regulators (NIPBL, HDAC8) or structural ele ments (SMC1A, SMC3, RAD21) of the cohesin complex. As regards X linked CdLS, a higher prevalence of females is described for both SMC1A, partially escaping X inactivation, and HDAC8, which is instead subject to X inactivati on. At present, 26 different mutations in 41 individuals with features partial ly overlapping with CdLS have been reported in the HDAC8 gene, confirming the key role of this lysine deacetylase in the proper functioning of the cohe sin complex. We analyzed a group of NIPBL and SMC1A negative patients with CdLS by classical sequencing approaches and exome/gene panel next generation technology. Thus we identified eight de novo HDAC8 mutations. Interestingly, one of which is shared by two siblings. The R166* nonsense mutation, the frameshift deletion F207Nfs*2 as well as all six missense mu tations C153R, N156K, P257L, T280I, C287Y, G320R all affect highly con served residues and were predicted to be damaging by four bioinformatics algorithms. All patients show a mild to severe phenotype overlapping with CdLS; the craniofacial appearance is similar but with some distinctions like a broader nose, dental anomalies and delayed anterior fontanelle closure. Moreover, postnatal growth retardation is less severe, and limb malfor mations have not yet been observed. Given the high percentage of HDAC8 mutations identified in our cohort, we suggest the HDAC8 screening as an essential part of the routine molecular diagnostics for patients with CdLS overlapping features.",2014

Cornelia de Lange syndrome is a well known multiple congenital anomalies/ mental retardation syndrome with genetic heterogeneity and wide clinical variability, regarding the severity of both the intellectual disabilities and the physical features, not completely explained by the genotype phenotype cor relations known to date. The aim of the study was the identification of prognostic features, ascertai nable precociously, of a better intellectual outcome and the development of a new prognostic index of severity of intellectual disabilities in CdLS pati ents. In 66 italian CdLS patients aged 8 years or more, we evaluated the associa tion of the degree of mental retardation with various clinical parameters ascertainable before 6 months of life and with the molecular data by the application of cumulative regression logistic model. Based on these results and on the previously known genotype phenotype correlations, we selected 7 parameters to be used in a multivariate cumulative regression logistic mo del to develop a prognostic index of severity of intellectual disability.

Known genetic causes are heterogeneous and in the majority of ca ses, no etiologies have been found. In order to achieve a genetic diagnosis, we performed chromosome analyses on microarrays (CMA) on 81 patients with CCA ID and no known causes. We found 34 different CNVs (42%) which were not carried in control subjects of the Database of Genomic Variants (DGV). Among these CNVs, 14 (17%) were de novo and considered to be likely pathogenic, with sizes varying from 1,3Mb to 24Mb, including 13 de letions and one inverted duplication with terminal deletion. Moreover, 12 CNVs (4 deletions and 9 duplications) were also carried by healthy parents, and therefore, could not be considered as the main causes of the phenotype. We were not able to recover blood samples of the parents to verify the 8 remaining CNVs. Thus, CMA seems to be a powerful tool in the diagnostic strategy of patients with CCA ID and no etiologies. However, most of the tested patients still remain with no identified genetic causes.

Cytogenetic analysis has demonstrated a mosaic deletion of chromosome 21: 46,XX,?mos del(21) (q21q21)[5]/ 46,XX[15]. Molecular cytogenetic analysis using oligonu cleotide array CGH has confirmed the presence of mosaic deletion spanning 21q11.1q21.2 chromosome region (11.423 Mb). Additionally, a non mosaic deletion at 4p16.3 (size: 3.712 Mb) affecting 83 genes, 40 of which are listed in OMIM was found. Mosaic 21q11.1q21.2 was also confirmed using multi color chromosome banding (MCB), which has shown this deletion to affect 19% of cells. It is to note, that the index case has demonstrated a phenotype atypical for 4p16 deletions. Nevertheless, the main phenotypic outcome was likely to result from non mosaic 4p16.3 according to bioinformatics analysis, whereas mosaic 21q11.1q21.2 was concluded to be an additional co factor modulating the phenotype.

21641,"Oxidative stress plays a major role in the pathogenesis of leukemia prone di seases such as Fanconi anemia and Down syndrome. Objectives: To explore the oxidative stress state in children with Down syndrome and Fanconi ane mia by estimating the levels of antioxidants (e.g., malondialdehyde, total an tioxidant capacity and superoxide dismutase [SOD] activity) and DNA dama ge, and to evaluate of the effect of antioxidant treatment on these patients. Methods: The study included 32 children clinically diagnosed with Down syndrome (15 patients) and Fanconi anemia (17 patients) in addition to 17 controls matched for age and sex. Malondialdehyde, total antioxidant capa city, superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity and DNA damage were measured. Antioxidants including vitamin A, E and C were given to the patients accor ding to the recommended daily allowance (RDA) for 6 months. Clinical fol low up and re evaluation were conducted for all patients. Laboratory tests including complete blood count, karyotyping, DNA damage and oxidative stress were re evaluated. Results: Children with Fanconi Anemia and Down syndrome had elevated levels of oxidative stress and more DNA damage than controls. Oxidative stress parameters and DNA damage improved in Fanconi anemia and Down syndrome patients after antioxidant administration. Con clusions: Early administration of antioxidants to Fanconi anemia and Down syndrome patients is recommended for slowing of the disease course with symptoms amelioration and improvement of general health.",2014

We report the first case of DownÃ¢ÂÂs/TurnerÃ¢ÂÂs mosaic with robertsonian translocation. The patient was the first child of non consanguineous parents. It was a fe male whom born a term, by uneventful cesarean section, weighting 2,220g and with length of 46 cm, without neonatal complications. At birth, the pe diatrician made the diagnosis of Down syndrome. At 3 months, in consulta tion with routine pediatric a heart murmur was heard, so the patient was referred to a cardiologist. There were performed two surgeries to repair the heart defect, one with 6 months of life and another with 2 years. She also had mild developmental delay. At 3 years old she was examined at our outpatient Genetic unit. The patient showed more clinical findings of Down syndrome than Turner syndrome: low weight and height for age, microce phaly, flat facial profile, upslanting palpebral fissures, epicanthal folds, short nose with depressed nasal bridge, hypotonia with tendency to keep month open and protrude the tongue, short neck, single palmar creases, and pro minent ears. Cytogenetic analysis of peripheral blood preparations using G banding revealed mosaicism with 2 cell lines (mos 45, X [21] / 46,XX, + 21, rob (21;21)(q10;q10)[9]). Additional genetic studies (karyotypes) were made to define the cause which probably originated this double aneuploidy with this translocation. So we present the first case related of Down Turner mosaicism with robertsonian translocation and we review all the previous reports.",2014

The chromosome 16p12.2 p11.2 deletion syndrome, 7.1 to 8.7 Mb [OMIM#613604] is cha racterized phenotypically by dysmorphic facial features, feeding difficulties, recurrent ear infections, developmental delay and cognitive impairement.

21644,"We ascertained an Algerian consanguineous family in which two sibs pre sent with psychomotor delay, progressive microcephaly, spasticity, thin cor pus callosum, and severe and early onset obesity. Exome sequencing iden tified two homozygous substitutions cosegregating with the phenotype and locating 170 kb apart on 7q22.1: a c.1137+1G>T splice mutation in AP4M1 previously described in a Moroccan family and a c.595A>T misense varia tion in AZGP1 which encodes zinc alpha2 glycoprotein (ZAG). Haplotyping analysis indicated that the AP4M1 mutation was a founder mutation shared between both families, whereas the AZGP1 mutation is secondarily and uni que in our family. Mutations in AP4M1 cause AP4 deficiency syndrome, a condition characte rized by severe intellectual disability, progressive microcephaly and spasti city. Notably, none of the 25 previously reported cases with AP4 deficiency syndrome exhibited obesity. On the other hand, ZAG is an adipokine stimu lating lipolysis in adipocytes; ZAG likely regulates body weight since admi nistration of human ZAG to ob/ob mice resulted in progressive weight loss. We propose that the phenotype of our patients resulted from the additional effects of the two mutations in AP4M1 and AZGP1 accounting for the neuro logical signs and the precocious morbid obesity, respectively. The contiguous gene syndrome was proposed in 1986 to explain the as sociation of multiple and unrelated clinical features due to the deletion of multiple adjacent genes: the phenotype results from the combination of the endophenotypes of each contiguous gene sensitive to haploinsufficiency. Today, high throughput sequencing allows us to enlarge this concept to de scribe simultaneous transmission of independent mutations that are gene tically linked.",2014

We report 4 cases of examp le, presenting complex diseases, for which it was possible to reach rapidly a correct diagnosis only by exome sequencing. Patient 1 was a one month old female presenting dilated aortic root, exten sive arterial tortuosity, mild dysmorphisms and several musculoskeletal fea tures (joint laxity, arachnodactyly and pectus excavatum). Patient 2 (female, 3 years old) presented absent pulmonary valve, ectasia of the pulmonary trunk and aorta, motor developmental delay, joint laxity, strabismus, hy permetropia and mental retardation. Patient 3 was a 3 years old male re ferred for low set ears, micrognathia, generalized hypotonia, clubfeet and tricuspid regurgitation. Finally, Patient 4 (female, 3 years old) presented Marfanoid habitus, with aortic dilation. Because these features overlap with several neonatal rare disorders, we performed on patientsÃ¢ÂÂ (and parentsÃ¢ÂÂ) genomic DNA, Illumina TruSight Exome sequencing, generating a mean tar get coverage of 98.6% at >20X and a mean read depth of 257X. In Patient 1 we identified a homozygous mutation in fibulin 4 gene, associated with au tosomal recessive cutis laxa syndrome. Sequencing of Patient 2 surprisingly revealed a de novo missense mutation in ITPR1 gene, which causes conge nital non progressive spinocerebellar ataxia, resulting in altered develop ment of cerebellum. Patient 3 and 4 carry de novo mutations in genes that cause Loeys Dietz syndrome, TGFBR1 and TGFBR2 respectively. In conclu sion, these examples are significative for stressing that exome sequencing represents a helpful approach for differential diagnosis and for more closely specify therapeutic approach for individual patients.",2014

Fanconi anemia (FA) is an inherited disease characterized by congeni tal malformations, pancitopenia, cancer predisposition, and sensitivity to cross linking agents. The molecular diagnosis of FA is relatively complex, due to several aspects including genetic heterogeneity with mutations in at least 16 different genes. In this study, we report the mutations identified in 100 unrelated FA probands enrolled into the National Network of the Ita lian Association of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology. We identified 108 distinct variants of FANCA, FANCG, FANCC, FANCD2, and FANCB genes in 85, 9, 3, 2, and 1 families, respectively. Particularly, in FANCA we found main ly private mutations of all different categories (large intragenic deletions, nonsense, frameshift, splicing and missense mutations). Expression level of FANCA protein was studied in 32 lymphoblastoid cell lines of complemen tation group FA A and a correlation between the type of mutation and the expression level of FANCA was observed. In case of nonsense or frame shift mutations FANCA is not detectable whereas it is expressed at the same le vels as in controls when alleles are hit by missense or in frame mutations. Since it will be interesting to determine whether there is a correlation bet ween stable expression of mutant FANCA and phenotype, we have been eva luated a series of different aspects at both clinical and cellular levels in order to provide insights into potential residual activities of altered but expressed proteins.",2014

VACTERL H association is a rare and etiologically heterogeneous condition, characterized by a variable combination of many birth defects. It can repre sent a severe phenotype of Fanconi anemia (FA), a rare disease characteri zed by birth defects, bone marrow failure, cancer predispositions and in creased chromosomal instability due to mutations in at least 16 genes. The genetic heterogeneity together with the wide spectrum of mutations make the molecular genetic testing in FA a complex and tiered task, which could benefit from application of next generation sequencing strategies (NGS). We describe a family with 3 aborted fetuses affected with hydrocephalia and radial ray defects, variously associated with cardiac, renal and other skel etal anomalies. Both healthy parents originate from the same alpine val ley. A genetic counseling leading to a presumptive diagnosis of FA related VACTERL H was performed only after the second termination. Thus, a FA diagnostic diepoxybutane test could be performed only on cultured cells of the third fetus. The results confirmed the suspicion and complementation analysis excluded mutations in the two more frequent groups (FA A and FA G). We hence used the Ion PGM TM System and identified a homozygous c.484_485delCT mutation of FANCF gene. The same finding was found in DNA extracted from the first two fetuses. Only 1% of FA patients have muta tions in FANCF and, to the best of our knowledge, the 3 fetuses represent the first cases of VACTERL H association caused by mutations of FANCF.

It is characterized by cra niofacial anomalies (oculoauriculo vertebral (OAV) dysplasia, hemifacial microsomia, facioauriculo vertebral sequence), epibulbar tumours, ear mal formation and vertebral anomalies; cardiac, pulmonary, renal, skeletal, and central nervous system anomalies have also been described. The etiology of GS is not fully understood, it seems related to vascular disruption, predomi nantly of the stapedial and the external carotid artery, which alters the mor phogenesis of structures derived from the first and second branchial arches. Although most affected individuals are isolated cases in otherwise normal families, some familial cases suggest that GS might have a genetic basis. Lin kage and array CGH analysis have detected several candidate loci for this genetically heterogeneous condition (including deletions in 1p22.2 p31.1, 2q11, 5p14, 12p13.33, 14q31.1q31.3, 15q24.1q24.2, 18p, 22q11.2, 22qter; duplications in 14q23.1, 22q11q13, unbalanced translocations, trisomies of chromosomes 7,8,9,10p, 22).

He was also affected by bilateral severe hearing loss, iris and chorioretinal coloboma in the right eye, dermoid cyst in the left eye, two preauricular tags on the left ear and one tag on the left cheek, facial asymmetry and growth retardation. SNP array release hg19 showed a microdeletion of chromosome 12q13.3 [(57,160,163 57,317,932)x1 pat] and a microduplication of chromosome 12q22.33 [(90,562,016 91 ,612,832)x3 mat]. In the duplicated region there are two genes, KERA and DCN. The protein encoded by KERA gene is a Keratan Sulfate Proteoglycan that is involved in corneal transparency. It may be important in developing and maintaining corneal transparency and for the structure of the stromal matrix. The protein encoded by DCN gene is Decorine, a component of the extracellular matrix, involved in the organization of collagens. Collagens play an important role in the cornea, which is the clear outer covering of the eye. Bundles of collagen called fibrils must be strictly organized for the cornea to be transparent. Decorin ensures that these collagen fibrils are uniformly sized and regularly spaced.

Cardio facio cutaneous (CFC) syndrome was suggested as the most likely diagnosis, due to the severity of develop mental delay and one previous report of hepatoblastoma in CFC syndrome.

Introduction: Holt Oram syndrome (HOS) is an autosomal dominant disor der characterized by upper limb malformation in combination with conge nital heart defect. More than 70% of patients who meet diagnostic criteria have an identifiable mutation in TBX5. Clinical report: 32 year old woman. Second gestation. Abortion at 20 weeks because of bilateral upper limb amelia in a male fetus. Normal ka ryotype. No necropsy. The patient had a healthy son. Her partner had required surgery to correct atrial septal defect in childhood. He displayed low set thumbs with no major upper limb anomalies. In a further gestation, ultrasound detected again bilateral upper limb amelia in a male fetus at 12 weeks. Karyotype and heterochromatic repulsion ana lysis were normal. The patient underwent abortion. Post mortem examina tion didnÃÂ´t reveal heart defects. No environmental hazards were identified. A new pregnancy was followed closely by high resolution ultrasound, wit hout detecting anomalies in a female fetus. At birth, triphalangeal thumbs and atrial septal defect were present. TBX5 gene sequencing analysis re vealed no mutations. MLPA showed a deletion in exon 9, not previously de scribed. The same deletion was detected in the second affected fetus and the father, co segregating with the disease. Discussion: Upper extremities abnormalities are variably expressed, even within families. Although phocomelia has been described in HOS, there are few reports of frank amelia. TBX5 analysis should be therefore considered in such finding, even in the absence of heart defect. We report on a new exonic deletion in TBX5. Upcoming expression and exome analysis will help elucidate the mechanisms and modifying factors underlying its remarkable variable expressivity.",2014
21659,"Holt Oram syndrome (HOS) is characterized by the congenital malformati ons of the heart, limbs, often accompanied with variable skeletal abnormali ties. HOS associated limb malformations usually involve absent or hypopla stic radial bone(s) and often abnormal thumb(s), which may be digitalised, absent, hypoplastic, triphalangeal or bifid. In a subset of patients, the syn drome results from TBX5 mutations. To date, about 60 different TBX5 gene lesions resulting in HOS have been identified. In this report, we describe three index cases of Polish ethnicity suspected of HOS, in whom we perfor med TBX5 Sanger sequencing. In all three probands we identified hetero zygous TBX5 causative mutations: c.255 256delCA(p. P85fs94X), c. C524T(p. S175F), c. C668T(p. T223M). The first two mutations were novel, whereas the latter one represented previously identified variant. In the first two probands we observed severe bilateral hypoplasia of the radial bones and absent thumbs. Both probands presented with complex congenital heart defect composed of ventricular septal defect and persistent foramen ovale. The third patient was born with inborn heart defect in the form of atrial septum defect with patent ductus arteriosus and skin syndactyly of thumbs with second fingers.

Although based on a small sample, our study shows that TBX5 mutations may account for a significant proportion of HOS causative alte rations and points to the importance of TBX5 mutational screening in the patients clinically suspected of this syndrome.",2014
21660,"15q25.2 microdeletion is an emergent CNV locus for intellectual disability, dysmorphic features and congenital anomalies. Two distinct microdeletions have been described at this locus: 1) a distal deletion (11 cases) responsib le for neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric disorders and 2) a proxi mal deletion (8 cases) which is a susceptibility locus for cognitive deficit, diaphragmatic hernia and Diamond Blackfan anemia (DBA). This proximal deletion is said to predispose to DBA because it contains the gene RPS17, encoding for a ribosomal protein, responsible for 2% of DBA. Until now, ho wever, DBA has been diagnosed with certainty in only one case of 15q25 proximal deletion. The additional case reported here had a history of intra uterine growth retardation. Aged 18 months, the patient had a moderate developmental delay, dysmorphic features and musculoskeletal anomalies. He had a normochromic macrocytic aregenerative anemia with elevated erythrocyte adenosine deaminase activity and elevated HbF (3.2%) highly suggestive of DBA. A 15q25.2 microdeletion of 2.2Mb including RPS17 was identified using SNP array. The deletion of RPS17 was confirmed by FISH using a specific probe. The deletion was absent in the patientÃ¢ÂÂs father and was impossible to test in his mother. To date, only a few mutations in RSP17 have been reported in patients with DBA. Anemia was mentioned in 4 cases among the 8 previous reported cases of 15q25.2 proximal deletion but the definite diagnosis of DBA was made in only 1 case. The present report con firms that patients with 15q25.2 deletion involving RSP17 are at risk of DBA and possibly DBA associated malignancies.",2014
21661,"We report on a 15 year old girl presenting with moderate intellectual disa bility, delays in speech and language acquisition, strabism and severe chro nic constipation looking like Hirschsprung disease in spite of the presence of ganglion cells. Her parents are not consanguineous and in good health but her paternal half brother presents speech difficulties and moderate intellectual disability. Conventional chromosome analysis was considered as normal, but array CGH showed a 10,2Mb interstitial duplication of the 2q24.3q31.2 region. In situ hybridization of paternal metaphases revealed a direct intrachromosomal insertion of the long segment of chromosome 2 at band q32.3 between bands 2q24.3 and 2q31.2 . The duplication observed in the patient results from an abnormal meiotic recombination of the fatherÃ¢ÂÂs insertion. Given its risk of recurrence for another child, an abnormality of the same chromosomal region has now to be searched in the girlÃ¢ÂÂs half brother. The function of several duplicated genes can explain the phenotype of the patient. As it is, to our knowledge, the first 2q24.3q31.2 duplication reported, additional patients are needed to improve the description of the phenotype.",2014
21662,"Joubert syndrome (JS) is a ciliopathy characterized by a distinctive hind brain malformation, ataxia and cognitive dysfunction. It is typically inheri ted in an autosomal recessive manner caused by biallelic mutations in one of >20 genes, but despite the large number of causal genes, the underlying cause remains unknown in more than one third of affected individuals. Af fected individuals carrying multiple heterozygous rare deleterious variants (RDVs) in known JS associated genes raise the possibility of more complex genetics. To search for evidence of oligogenicity (defined as disease cau sation through combined effects of two or more heterozygous RDVs) and genetic modifiers, we used a novel molecular inversion probe based (MIP) capture technology to sequence all known JS associated genes in a large JS cohort. Using a recessive model where biallelic RDVs in any of the known JS associated genes were considered causal, we were able to determine the cause in less than two thirds of our subjects. In the remaining subjects, only a small number carried heterozygous RDVs in two or more JS associated ge nes, and this proportion was not significantly different from that observed in a control population. Moreover, Sanger sequencing identified a second RDV that had been missed by MIP sequencing in several subjects, thereby establishing a recessive cause in these individuals. Thus, our data do not support the hypothesis that a significant proportion of JS cases are due to oligogenicity involving RDVs in the known JS genes. Current analyses focus on determining whether genetic burden correlates with disease severity. ABSTRACTS POSTERS ESHG 2014 | MILAN, ITALY | WWW. ESHG. ORG 222Back to inde x",2014

The MKS1 gene also accounts for a minor fraction of the total mutational load in Bardet Biedl Syndrome. We report the phenotype of a five year old boy from Austria with episodes of apnoe during the first 7 months of life, severe hypotonia, psychomotor re tardation, congenital nystagmus and a molar tooth sign detected in the MRI of the brain, which suggested the diagnosis of Joubert syndrome. Next Generation sequencing based multi gene panel diagnostics from a blood sample revealed two mutations located in the MKS1 gene: The first mutation, c.1407 7_1408_35del29, is known to be a major cause for Meckel Gruber Syndrome in homozygous state. The second mutation is a missense mutation that has not yet been reported. Five bioinformatic tools predict an alteration of protein function caused by the mutation. We therefore assume that these two mutations in the MKS1 gene in compound heterozygous state are causative for the phenotype. Mutations in the MKS1 gene are primarily reported in patients with Mec kel Gruber Syndrome, a phenotype which denotes the most severe (usual ly lethal) end of the spectrum of ciliopathies with occipital encephalocele and other early embryonic malformations. Here we describe a patient with classical Joubert syndrome which underlines the genetic heterogeneity in Joubert syndrome and illustrates the pleiotropy of MKS1 mutations.",2014
21664,"Objective: To review the clinical and molecular characteristics of 18 patients presenting a suspected diagnosis of Kabuki Syndrome (KS) in the first year of life, in order to outline the clinical handles leading to a prompt diagnosis of KS in newborns. Clinical diagnosis of KS can be challenging during the first year of life, as many diagnostic features become evident only in subse quent years. Methods: All patients were clinically investigated by trained clinical geneti cists. A literature review was performed using the Pubmed online database and Diagnostic criteria suggested by DYSCERNE_ Kabuki Syndrome Guide lines (2010) were used. Molecular analysis of the known causative genes of KS, MLL2 and KDM6A, was performed through targeted resequencing, using MiSeqÃÂ® sequencing platform. All mutations identified were validated by Sanger sequencing standard protocols. Results: Facial dysmorphisms (94%), feeding difficulties (100%) and hypo tonia (100%) suggested the clinical diagnosis of KS. Notably, long palpebral fissures and large anteverted ears were present in 94% and 100% of the cohort, respectively. Other abnormalities such as brachydactyly, joint laxity and nail dysplasia were present in 15 (83%) patients. Congenital heart di seases occurred in 14 (77%) cases, the most common defects being septal defects (11/18;61%) and left sided obstructive lesions (4/18; 22%). Mu tations in MLL2 gene were identified in 16/18 (89%) of the patients, while none of the patients had KDM6A mutations. Conclusions: We present an overview of patients with KS diagnosed during the first year of life. Early diagnosis is serviceable in terms of clinical ma nagement and for targeted genetic counselling.",2014

At present, two causative genes for KS have been identified, the MLL2 and the KDM6A genes. In this study we analyzed the prevalence of CHD, cardiac anatomic types and molecular characteristics of 41 patients with KS from a single institution. All patients underwent car diological evaluation. Analysis of MLL2 and KDM6A genes was performed through targeted resequencing, using MiSeqÃÂ® sequencing platform. All mu tations were validated through Sanger sequencing. MLL2 mutations were found in 34/41 (83%), including nonsense, frameshift, in frame duplicati on, and missense variants. Two/41 (5%) had KDM6A mutations. Additional chromosome rearrangements were detected in 3. CHDs in MLL2 mutated patients (23/34,68%) included LVOTOs (bicuspid aortic valve, aortic coarc tation, Shone complex) in 11/23 (48%), subaortic ventricular septal defect in 5/23 (22%), atrial septal defect in 4/23 (17%), abnormal pulmonary ve nous return (APVR) in 2/23 (9%), double outlet right ventricle (DORV) in one (4%). The patients with KDM6A mutation had normal heart. In conclu sion, the high proportion of left sided obstructions and the cardiac overlap with Turner syndrome (LVOTOs and APVR) have been confirmed.

Hypermobility has been described as one of the major fea tures of KS. However, no prevalence of hypermobility is known within the population of children with KS. On assessment of KS children in our clinic, we noticed that the degree and the pattern of hypermobility varies greatly amongst patients. Therefore, we aimed to assess the degree and pattern of hypermobility in the KS individuals. Twenty individuals (age 3 30 years old) with KS and a known KMT2D mu tation were assessed. The persons were evaluated using two systems: the Beighton and the Bulbena score. The prevalence of hypermobility in this cohort was 25% using the Beighton score, and 45% using the Bulbena score. The difference between these two percentages is due to the items within each system and the pattern of hy permobility in the KS patients. These patients have a non generalized pat tern of hypermobility with the small joints of the hands and feet, hips and knees most affected. In contrast with the general population, boys with KS have a higher degree of hypermobility than girls with KS. We present the data in a graphical way. In conclusion, persons with KS have a specific non generalized pattern of hypermobility with hips, patellae and the small joints of the hands most af fected.

Large deleti ons and nonsense or frameshift point mutations involving KDM6A (UTX) on Xp11.3 are another very rare cause of this condition (KS2, MIM 300867).Here, we describe seven new patients with de novo KDM6A mutations, which doubles the number of reported cases with point mutations in KS2. We re port, for the first time, germline missense and splice site KDM6A mutations and confirm their pathogenicity via multiple lines of evidence. Combined analysis from two centres shows that less than 5% cases of Kabuki syndro me are due to KDM6A mutations. Our findings enable a detailed review of the clinical features of KS2. We demonstrate that the developmental delay and learning disability in KS2 is generally moderate severe in boys and mild moderate in girls. Speech and cognition tend to be more severely affected than motor development. Some girls with KDM6A mutations may have a normal developmental profile.

Here we present molecular genetic analysis in a cohort of 14 Czech patients with clinical symptoms indicative of KS by DNA sequencing of coding regi ons of KMT2D and KDM6A genes, including MLPA based analysis (kit P389 A1) of intragenic rearrangements within KMT2D . Mutations in KMT2D were detected in 6/14 (43%) of patients. All detected mutations were truncating, thereby predicting haploinsufficiency. Three mutations were previously pu blished (c.16371_16374del, c.8743C>T , c.5627_5630del) and three are no vel (c.2488G>T , c.4549_4549delG, c.6349_6350delinsA). No mutations were detected within the KDM6A , as well as intragenic rearrangements were not found in KMT2D gene (MLPA assay for KDM6A is not available, thus far). Our results substantiated the disease association with KMT2D gene.

KAT6B encodes lysine acetyltransferase 6B, a part of histone H3 acetyltrans ferase complex. KAT6B is highly conserved and expressed in adult neural stem cells. Most mutations are in exon 18 encoding the acidic (A) and tran scriptional activation (TA) domains of KAT6B. Genotype phenotype correla tion showed that patients with mutations in the 5ÃÂ´ region of exon 18 leading to loss of both domains suffer from GPS, while patients with mutations in the 3ÃÂ´ region leading to loss of the TA domain suffer from SBBYSS.

Here we report a subgroup of patients referred for multiple malformations, developmental delay / cognitive impairment, and an apparent normal stan dard karyotype. Whole genome array CGH analysis (60 K, Agilent Techno logies) identified six patients with large terminal complex rearrangements, all beyond the threshold of 5Mb (6 to 18 Mb). Results were suggestive for the presence of an unbalanced translocation derivative, confirmed by FISH analysis. Five were inherited from a parent with a balanced translocation, and one was apparently de novo. Comparison of the karyotype and array CGH showed that cytogenetic re arrangements were all almost indistinguishable from a normal karyotype, swapping similar band patterns. Only one case was recurrent in an affected brother with the same rearran gement and an identical phenotype. Miscarriages were reported in two fa milies.

These mutations were located in different exons of ACTG2: exon 3 (R40C), 4 (R63Q) and 7 (R178C and R178H) and were considered to have a pathogenic effect by at least 2 out of 3 prediction programs. Although several sib pairs have been published, the majority of the patients were sporadic, consistent with the presence of de novo mutations in a single gene. Interestingly, the mutation affecting residue R178 has also been reported in 2 other MMIHS patients1, suggesting that this position could play a major role in MMIHS pathogenesis. Moreover, the fact that ACTG2 mutations were excluded in the 2 families, points towards the involvement of a second locus. Whole exome sequencing of these families should prove the involvement of another gene.1. Thorson et al. Hum Genet 2013.",2014
21680,"We report on a 2ÃÂ½ year old boy with mental retardation, muscular hypoto nia, deafness with atresia of the external auditory canal and a preauricular tag on the right side. The boy was referred for global intellectual disabili ty with very limited speech capabilities and autistic traits. The pregnancy had been uneventful except for an emergency Cesarean section because of breech position. Birth measurements were normal, however, the baby was hypotonic and exhibited difficulties in feeding. At physical examination at the age of 2ÃÂ½ years measurements were still normal but we noted discrete dysmorphic features: long eye lashes, broad mouth with cupid bow lips, small fingers with broad short endphalanges, clinodactyly of toes V on both sides, tender translucent skin, fine hair and cryptorchidism on the right side. On the MRI at the age of 2 years delayed myelinisation was visible. As the atresia of the external auditory canal is typical for a deletion 18q we performed a karyotype on lymphocytes which was first reported with no pathological findings. The array (2.7 Affymetrix SNP oligo array platform) analysis revealed a de letion in mosaic form of 20.7 Mb of the long arm of chromosome 18, encom passing 69 genes in total. The mosaic was confirmed with FISH, which also revealed that the mosaic ratio in this case was 13% in cultivated blood and 81% in buccal swab. Reevaluating the karyotype the deletion was visible. This case demonstrates the higher sensitivity of SNParrayCMA testing for mosaic aberrations. ABSTRACTS POSTERS ESHG 2014 | MILAN, ITALY | WWW. ESHG. ORG 226Back to inde x",2014
21681,"Next generation sequencing (NGS) is a rapidly evolving method for the molecular diagnostics of hereditary genetic disorders, NGS is based on par allel sequencing, capable of reading the sequences of whole genes in a single run. Using this technology, we analysed two causative genes NF1 (neuro fibromatosis) containing 58 exons, and PKHD1 (polycystic kidney disease) with 67 exons. Neurofibromatosis is an autosomal dominant disorder of the nervous system, characterised by cafÃÂ© au lait spots, cutaneous neurofibro mas and Lisch nodules in the iris, affecting 1 in 3 5,000 people. Polycystic kidney disease is an autosomal recessive disorder, characterised by the de velopment of cysts affecting the collecting ducts. The population prevalence is 1:85,000 individuals. Methods: DNA was isolated from peripheral blood and amplicons prepared by PCR were analysed on a GS Junior system (Ro che). Data were analysed by AVA (Roche) and Sequence Pilot (JSI medical systems) software. Results: We analysed 11 patients for PKHD1, and found the following mutations: Thr36Met, Leu2128X, Ile2957Thr, Ile2331Lys, Thr36Met, Gly112Arg, Arg92Trp, Gly1712Arg, Gln1122Ser (not described) and Ser3505Arg (with unknown effect). Four patients were negative. Of 5 NF1 patients, three were negative and two patients (who were related) had a deletion of TAACTT in exon 48. Conclusion: NGS is a very useful method for the analysis of large genes with many exons, such as NF1 and PKHD1. These genes can be sequenced in a single run, instead of multiple single reactions. In the future we intend to analyse more genes using NGS, namely COL2A1 (Stickler syndrome) and USH2A (Usher syndrome).",2014

Constitutional dysregulation of the Ras mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway can lead to Noonan Syndrome (NS) or similar disorders, the so called Ã¢ÂÂRASopathiesÃ¢ÂÂ, which are characterized by an over lapping pattern of physical abnormalities and cognitive impairment. Their molecular basis is an overactive Ras MAPK signaling pathway caused by gain of function mutations. In animal models, it has been shown that mu tations in homologous genes can lead to impaired cognitive function and reduced synaptic plasticity.

21686,"Introduction: Noonan syndrome (NS) is an autosomal dominant disorder which together with Cardio facio cutaneous syndrome (CFC), Costello syndrome (CS) and Noonan Neurofibromatosis syndrome (NFNS) belongs to a group of genetic syndromes called Ã¢ÂÂRASopathiesÃ¢ÂÂ. These disorders are characterised by occurance of similar phenotypic features. Among the most common are short stature, specific dysmorphic facial features and congeni tal heart anomalies. Ã¢ÂÂRASopathiesÃ¢ÂÂ are caused by mutations in genes resul ting in dysregulation of RAS MAPK signaling pathway. Mutations in PTPN11 account for approximately 50% of all cases of Noonan syndrome. Aims: The comparism of phenotype features in patients with PTPN11 muta tion and without PTPN11 mutation. Methods: Mutation analysis of PTPN11 gene was performed in 19 Slovak patients with phenotype of NS. It consisted of polymerase chain reaction and direct sequencing of 15 coding exons and exon/intron boundaries of the PTPN11 gene. Results: We identified PTPN11 mutations in 47% of our patients (N,19) with clinical diagnosis of Noonan syndrome. Comparing the prevalence of phenotypic features in patients with PTPN11 mutation with prevalence of the same features in patients without PTPN11 mutation, we found the most significant differences in cryptorchidism (100% vs. 0%), pulmonary steno sis (78% vs. 10%), pterygium colli (0% vs. 70%) and birth length which was short only in 22% of patients with PTPN11 mutation in comparison to 80% in patients without PTPN11 mutation. Conclusions: Our findings show that cryptorchidism, pulmonary stenosis, pterygium colli and short birth length are the most important features that distinguish patients with mutation in PTPN11 from patients without PT PN11 mutation.",2014
21687,"Noonan syndrome (NS) is a rare disease belonging to the group of RASopa thies caused by the germline mutations in genes encoding proteins of RAS/MAPK signaling pathway. The majority (about 50%) of cases is caused by PTPN11 mutations. Also mutations in RAF1 and SOS1 are quite common (up to 17 and 13%, respectively). The aim of the study was the identification of molecular defect responsible for the NS phenotype using whole exome sequencing (WES). Forty two patients with primary clinical diagnosis of Noonan syndrome and excluded mutation in PTPN11 , SOS1 and RAF1 ge nes were included in the study. The WES was performed using Illumina sequencing platform. The WES analysis allowed for the identification of mutation in RASopathies related genes in 7/42 (16.7%) NS patients. The p. Ser2Gly mutation in SHOC2 was identified in 2 patients. The mutations in NF1 (p. Met1035Arg, p. Tyr2556*), BRAF (p. Gln257Arg, p. Thr241Pro) and KRAS (p. Asp153Val) genes were found in 2, 2 and 1 patients, respectively. In two patients, mutations (p. Phe82Val and p.

We report on a subject with molecular confirmed diagnosis of Mazzanti syndrome with neuroblastoma, first suspected at the age of 3 months by abdominal ultrasound. At first evaluation he showed a round face, blond, thin and sparse hair, slightly down slanting palpebral fissures, slightly posterior rotated ears, evident palmar creases, mild generalized hypotonia and dystrophy, espe cially in his face and legs. Because of severe feeding difficulty and failure to thrive he underwent an abdominal ultrasound and subsequently abdominal MRI, which confirmed the presence of a circumscribed retroperitoneal no dular lesion between inferior cava vein and aortic artery at the level of the liver (2.7 x 1.5 x 2.2 cm), hyperintense in T2 and isointense in T1, with slight enhancement with contrast. The mass was completely removed and the hi stological analysis documented a neuroblastoma, poorly differentiated with intermediate MKI.

Opitz trigonocephaly (or C syndrome, OTCS) and Bohring Opitz syndro me (or C like syndrome, BOS) are two rare genetic disorders which show phenotypic overlap. The genetic bases of these diseases are not well under stood. Two genes have previously been associated with OTCS or BOS with a dominant pattern of inheritance. Whereas the CD96 gene has been related to OTCS (one case out of 25) and to BOS (one case in 4 patients analyzed), ASXL1 (Additional Sex Combs Like 1) has been related to BOS only (around half of the patients). In this study we analyzed CD96 and ASXL1 in a cohort of twelve individuals, including two sibs. Eight of them were diagnosed with OTCS, two displayed a BOS phenotype and another two could not be accura tely diagnosed. Exome sequences were available for six patients with OTCS and three couples of parents, in which CD96 and ASXL1 were inspected using bioinformatic tools. For the remaining patients, Sanger sequencing of all exons in these genes was carried out. Detailed scrutiny of the sequences allowed identification of only one potentially pathogenic mutation in one of the patients. In this subject, affected with BOS, we identified a de novo mu tation in ASXL1 (c.2100dupT). By nature and location within the gene, this insertion resembles those previously described in other BOS patients and we conclude that it may be responsible for the disease. Our results indicate that for eleven out of the twelve patients, the disease (OTCS or BOS) is not caused by mutations in CD96 or ASXL1.",2014

The mutation appeared germline in peripheral blood, buccal swabs and skin fibroblasts (Sanger se quencing); it has not been observed in published PIK3CA related segmental overgrowth patients. Phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5 triphosphate immuno staining of patient cells and Epidermal Growth Factor mediated PI3K AKT mTOR pathway stimulation proved that p.

Altered stoichiometry within the p85 p110 complex could underlie the hyperactive PI3K AKT mTOR signaling in this instance. Further experiments to investi gate this are currently ongoing.

Incidence was reported to be 1/30000 births, with higher prevalence in males. Most cases are sporadic. Familial recurrence has been observed but PS genetic etiology remains to be clari fied. Since PS involved structures may originate from the same embryonic tissues, genes controlling cell proliferation, migration, and differentiation of these tissues might be involved. Alternatively, one common assumption is that PS may origin from an embryonic vascular insult indicating genes con trolling vessels development as indirectly involved. We recruited a large cohort of PS patients (more than 250, about 10% fami lial). Karyotype analysis in 128 patients did not show any relevant alterati ons. ArrayCGH revealed the presence of chromosome anomalies in 19 out of 119 analyzed patients (10 duplications and 9 deletions); bioinformatic data analysis indicates gene enrichment in different pathways including those involved in cell cell adhesion and muscle structure development. We selec ted 3 sporadic and 6 apparently dominant familial cases for whole exome sequencing. PatientsÃ¢ÂÂ parents, affected and non affected siblings to a total of 31 subjects were sequenced. Preliminary data from one trio confirm invol vement of genes regulating cell cell and cell matrix interaction and also in dicate a possible contribution by genes implicated in vascular development. Analysis of other sequenced families is now ongoing in order to check sha ring and segregation of newly identified variants between different patients, and to clarify their role in pathogenesis of PS.",2014

Noonan syndrome (NS) is a genetically heterogeneous developmental disor der characterized by reduced growth, dysmorphic facial features, congenital heart defects, skeletal and hematological anomalies, and variable cognitive deficits. NS is caused by aberrant signaling through the RAS MAPK cascade, and we previously identified PTPN11 as the major gene underlying this con dition. PTPN11 encodes SHP2, an SH2 domain containing protein tyrosine phosphatase functioning as a signal transducer that positively modulates RAS function. Mutations in the same gene are implicated in LEOPARD syn drome (LS), a disease clinically related to NS, or contribute to leukemogene sis. Here, we explored further the molecular spectrum of germline PTPN11 lesions and their associated phenotype. Mutation scanning of the entire PT PN11 coding sequence was performed in large NS/LS cohorts collected in the frame of the NSEuroNet Consortium. Among the 452 mutation positive subjects, 68 different variants deemed to be of pathological significance, in cluding 12 novel missense changes and 2 in frame indels, were identified. Besides the previously characterized mutations destabilizing SHP2Ã¢ÂÂs inacti ve state or increasing binding to phosphotyrosyl containing partners, a no vel mutation cluster was recognized. Specifically, eleven changes affecting Leu 261, Leu262 and Arg265 were identified in ten unrelated subjects with clini cal features fitting NS. Biochemical and structural characterization of these mutants provided novel insights on disease pathogenesis. Finally, these data and published records were used to define more accurately the mutational spectrum of germline and somatic PTPN11 mutations in human disease.",2014

21701,"Resistance to thyroid hormone is an autosomal dominant disorder that affects 1 in every 40,000 births. It is characterized by reduced soft tissue responsiveness to thyroid hormone, with increased levels of T4 and T3 and non suppressed thyroid hormone (TSH), due to mutations present in the thyroid hormone receptor ÃÂ² gene (TRÃÂ²), particularly in its T3 binding domain. The clinical phenotype varies both between different families and between affected family members. Individuals with RTH can have variable resistance in different tissues, as a consequence of mixed features of hypo and hyperthyroidism. Our goal was to assess whether there was a functio nal alteration due to the mutation L440Xfs in TRÃÂ² gene that may generate RTH in our patient. In this study, we performed molecular and functional characterization of the L440Xfs mutation found in a male patient, who was diagnosed with RTH at 15 months of age. The patient harbors a new muta tion in exon 10 of the TRÃÂ² gene, which consists of a deletion of a cytosine at nucleotide 1609 in the position 440, leading to a stop codon. The mutation was found in neither his parents nor his two healthy sisters, indicating a de novo mutational event. Transfection studies showed that the mutant TRÃÂ² was unable to carry out the transcription of luciferase gene in the presence of T3. Therefore, it is likely that the impaired receptor generates the severe RTH phenotype in our propositus.",2014

Post mortem, clinical examination showed multiple joint contractures and peculiar facial features like thick hair, absent eyelashes and eyebrows, hypertelorsim, small nose, small mouth in the Ã¢ÂÂOÃ¢ÂÂ position with thin lips, micrognathia, low set ears. The skin was thin, erythematous and translu cent with evident superficial vessels. Fissures and erosions were evident in particular in the axillary and inguinal folds, nails were long.

Molecular analysis performed on fetal DNA, showed a homozygous duplication in ZMPSTE24 gene, already described as causative for RD. The second patient is a SGA boy, born at 32 weeks of gestation by urgent cesa rean section because of premature membrane rupture and pathologic CTG. Apgar was 3 0 and cardiopulmonary resuscitation was effective only after orotracheal intubation because of choanal stenosis, midface hypoplasia, micrognathia, microstomia and tight trismus. At this moment, spontaneous breathing is maintained through respiratory support.

The Rubinstein Taybi syndrome (RSTS) is a genetic disorder associated with growth defects, intellectual disability, and increased risk of tumors. About 60% of RSTS individuals carry heterozygous mutation/deletion of CREBBP gene, while ~3 8% of RSTS are caused by mutations in the EP300 gene. CREBBP and p300 proteins play a key role in many aspects of DNA metabo lism, such as DNA repair. However, the efficiency of DNA damage response (DDR) in RSTS is not yet elucidated. Here, we have investigated DDR in lym phoblastoid cell lines from RSTS patients carrying monoallelic deletion, or mutations of CREBBP gene. RSTS cells showed signs of histone H2AX phos phorylation, indicating an endogenous DNA damage. In addition, all RSTS cell lines tested were more sensitive to treatment with the oxidative agent KBrO3. No significant differences were observed in protein expression le vels of PCNA, and DNA repair proteins, such as XP proteins, PARP 1, XRCC1 and DNA polymerase ÃÂ². The analysis of the recruitment of DNA repair pro teins (PCNA, DNA polymerase ÃÂ², XRCC1) to DNA damage sites, suggests that in RSTS the DNA repair process is slowed or impaired. Preliminary results on the efficiency of DNA repair, as assessed by the Comet test, has suggest a delayed kinetics in the repair of oxidative lesions in RSTS cells, in particular at the level of DNA incision. These results suggest that RSTS cells show a reduced efficiency in DNA repair, explaining the greater sensitivity to oxida tive DNA damage, and accounting for the increased susceptibility to cancer of RSTS patients.",2014

Schinzel Giedion syndrome was first described in 1979, and is characteri zed by typical facial gestalt, severe developmental delay, frequent epilepsy and various malformations (urinary tract, genitalia, heart and skeletal). The reported cerebral malformations are ventriculomegaly, thin or absent cor pus callosum, cortical atrophy, gyration anomalies. Hypoplastic pons was found in 2 patients. In 2010, SETBP1 gene was identified as responsible for Schinzel Giedion syndrome, with identification, by exome, of de novo missense mutations, some recurrent, all localized in the SKI oncogene homologous domain. We present 5 novel patients with Schinzel Giedion syndrome (2 girls and 3 boys) with mutation in SETBP1 (proven de novo for 3). Two mutations were previously reported (c.2602G>A, c.2608G>A) and the 3 others were novel (c.2607C>A, c.2608G>T , c.2606G>C). All patients had typical facial gestalt, severe developmental delay, epilepsy, genitalia anomalies. Hydronephrosis was present in 4 patients, and the 5th patient had coralliform kidney stones with recurrent infections. Cerebral MRI showed constant corpus callosum anomalies, and frequent cortical atrophy, ventricular dilatation, septal rup ture. Two patients had gyration anomalies.

21705,"Schinzel Giedion syndrome (SGS) is a rare and severe developmental disor der characterized by malformations in multiple organ systems. Exome se quencing recently identified the cause of SGS as de novo germline mutations clustering within a 12 bp exonic region in SETBP1. Mutations in this SETBP1 hotspot are presumed to be gain of function mutations which disrupt a de gron (a consensus motif for protein degradation), disturbing normal SET BP1 proteolysis. Interestingly, somatic mutations in this hotspot have also been found in leukemic cells and shown to increase cell proliferation in this context. We have collected clinical information and samples from over 25 SGS pati ents, which to our knowledge constitutes the largest cohort of SGS patients yet. To better understand germline de novo mutations in SETBP1, we inve stigated the parental origin of the allele in which these mutations occur in SGS. Using a combination of long range PCR and single molecule real time sequencing (Pacific Biosciences), we determined the parent of origin for four out of five trios analyzed. In three out of four cases, the de novo mutati on in SETBP1 occurred in the paternal allele and only in one in the maternal allele. Additionally, we examined the molecular and cellular consequences of SETBP1 mutations in the context of SGS. When compared to controls, fi broblast and lymphoblastoid cell lines of SGS patients have alterations in downstream targets of SETBP1, such as higher levels of SET protein and de regulated gene expression. Our studies provide insight into the occurrence and molecular consequences of de novo germline SETBP1 mutations causing SGS.",2014

Indeed, the 5p15.2 critical Cri du Chat (CdC) region is spared and accordingly our patient does not present the typical dysmorphic and severe developmental features of CdC syndrome. The probandÃ¢ÂÂs father has a high pitched voice, a history of hyperactivity and poor school performances and normal EEG. Intrafamilial phenotype variabi lity is not uncommon in contiguous gene syndromes and it can be explained by differences in modifying genes and in critical allele polymorphisms. Schizencephaly is a full thickness cleft within the cerebral hemispheres, that can result from disruption or malformation. It has never been reported before in patients with 5p syndrome, who typically show a variable degree of hypoplasia, especially of subtentorial structures. Based on the already published phenotypic data and CNV databases as well as on the increasing knowledge on the function of the genes located in the deleted fragment, we discuss the genotype phenotype correlation in our pa tient and the consequence of haploinsufficiency of NSUN2 in determining speech delay and hyperactivity, and of ADAMTS16 in causing abnormal la rynx cartilages development.

Silver Russell syndrome is characterized by pre and postnatal growth re tardation, variable facial dysmorphisms, clinodactyly of the fifth fingers, and sometimes asymmetry of face, trunk and extremities. Genetic and epigenetic aberrations on chromosomes 7 and 11 are commonly found in SRS, leaving out however, a fraction of up to 50% of cases with unknown genetic aetiolo gy. A cohort of 32 clinically selected SRS patients, without detected genetic or epigenetic alterations was analyzed by high resolution array CGH analysis to identify possibly pathogenetic CNVs. Twenty eight patients (87.5%) were found to carry one or more rare CNVs, according to the Database of Genomic Variants and, overall, 55 rare CNVs, 25 gains (45.5%) and 30 losses (54.5%) were identified. Inheritance, established for 36 of the identified rare CNVs, showed that 7 occurred de novo (19.5%). Interrogation of public databases allowed us to pinpoint genomic regions containing genes, either imprinted or not, that according to their function, appeared plausible candidates for SRS. Interestingly 4 CNVs span genomic regions already associated with growth defects, 3 CNVs contain known genes found altered in previously described SRS patients and 3 CNVs include genes implicated in growth con trol pathways not yet associated with SRS. These results confirm the genetic heterogeneity of SRS and the high percentage of potentially causative imba lances, attesting the wide clinical expressivity of patients with a phenotype strongly suggestive for this syndrome.

He had moderately delayed developmental milestones, a poor appetite and feeding difficulties since the first year. Physical examination showed dysmorphic features sug gestive of Silver Russell Syndrome (SRS): triangular facies, relative macro cephaly with frontal bossing, prominent forehead, mild low set prominent ears, micrognathia, downturned mouth, thin lips, fifth finger brachidactyly/clinodactyly. Psychomotor development was normal. At 6 years he was 90 cm ( 5.12 SD) tall and weighed 8,900 kg ( 9.22 SD). His basal levels of free thyroxine, TSH, cortisol and coeliac disease screening were normal. Plasma concentrations of IGF I and IGFBP 3 were low for age and sex ( 2.30 and 1.95 SD). Growth hormone stimulation tests revealed a classic growth hormone deficiency. He also had severe insulin deficiency and normal glucose response after OGTT , negative diabetes autoantibodies and normal glycated haemoglobin, features not reported in association with SRS. Molecular studies revealed a hypomethylation of the paternal H19/IGF2 Im printing Control Region. Insulin like growth factor 2 (IGF2) is an imprinted gene, which has an important role in foetal growth. IGF2 is downregulated through hypomethylation of a differentially methylated region in SRS, cha racterised by growth restriction.

FISH analysis of the SMS locus at 17p11.2, as well as MLPA, mutational analyses and quantitative ex pression of the RAI1 gene, gave normal results. High resolution array CGH analysis disclosed two rare maternal deletions at 4q35.2 and Xq13.3, both yet unreported in healthy subjects according to the Database of Genomic Va riants. Whereas it is not possible to assign a pathogenetic role to the 4q35.2 deletion, the Xq13.3 loss of 54 kb involves a predicted conserved insulator that maps 29 kb far from the 5Ã¢ÂÂ end of the ZDHHC15 gene. ZDHHC15 acts as a palmitoyl transferase in brain, and its null expression has been reported in a syndromic patient. We thus investigated in the patientÃ¢ÂÂs blood the cau sative role of the identified CNV on ZDHHC15 by RT qPCR. The ZDHHC15 expression level was significantly reduced in the male proband compared to controls, whereas the expression level in the mother was within the control range.

Whereas the binding of TBC1D7, the third constitutive subunit of the TSC1 TSC2 complex, is required to maintain its integrity, sequencing of TSC patients with no TSC1 TSC2 mutations indica ted that TBC1D7 is unlikely to represent a Ã¢ÂÂTSC3Ã¢ÂÂ gene. Loss of function of TBC1D7 results in an increase in mTORC1 signaling, and consequently a de lay in the induction of autophagy. Mutations in TBC1D7 were recently reported in a family with ID and macro crania. Using exome sequencing we identified two sisters homozygote for a novel TBC1D7 truncating mutation. In addition to the already described ma crocephaly and mild ID, they share osteo articular defects, patella dislocati on, behavioral abnormalities, psychosis, learning difficulties, celiac disease, prognathism, myopia and astigmatism. Consistent with a loss of function of TBC1D7 the probandÃ¢ÂÂs cell lines show an increase in the phosphorylation of 4EBP1, a direct downstream target of mTORC1 and a delay in the initiation of the autophagy process. This second family allows enlarging the phenotypic spectrum associated with TBC1D7 mutations and defining a TBC1D7 syndrome.

TCOF1 mutations are observed in around 80% of the patients and are inherited as an autosomal dominant manner. Recently, two other genes have been reported in less than 2% of patients, POLR1D in patients with autoso mal dominant inheritance, and POLR1C in patients with autosomal recessi ve inheritance. Methods: We performed direct sequencing of TCOF1, POL R1C and POLR1D in two unrelated consanguineous families. Results: The four affected children shared the same homozygous mutation in POLR1D (c.163C>G, p. Leu55Val). This mutation is localized in a region encoding the dimerization domain of the RNA polymerase. It is supposed to impair RNA polymerase resulting in a lower amount of mature dimeric ribosomes. A functional analysis of the transcripts of TCOF1 by RT qPCR was performed in the first family demonstrating a 50% reduction in the index case compa tible with this hypothesis. Conclusion: This is the first report of POLR1D mutation responsible for an autosomal recessive inherited Treacher Collins syndrome. These results reinforce the concept of genetic heterogeneity of Treacher Collins syndrome and underline the importance of combining clinical expertise and familial molecular analyses for appropriate genetic counseling.

21718,"O. Papa Giovanni XXIII, Bergamo, Italy. Trisomy 13 (Patau syndrome) is a rare multiple malformation syndrome and includes anomalies of the central nervous system, cardio vascular and urogenital system. The probability of survival for live born to one year is 3%. Partial or mosaic forms of trisomy 13 can occur and they cause a va riable phenotype. We report a case of a live born baby with multiple congenital anomalies in cluding severe Fallot tetralogy, bilateral postaxial polydactyly of fingers and toes, monolateral hydronephrosis, microcephaly with trigonocephaly and brain anomalies (hypoplastic corpus callosum and dismorphic cerebellar vermis). The child also presents some facial anomalies (sloping forehead, hypotelorism, low set ears and microretrognathia) and scalp defect (aplasia cutis of vertex). Cytogenetics, fluorescence in situ hybridisation and array CGH analysis showed the presence of two cell lines in which a normal chro mosome 13 was replaced in one by a isochromosome (13q) and in the other by a isochromosome 13 derivative, with a deletion spanning from 13q11 to 13q14, resulting in partial trisomy 13q. The two cell lines were present either in peripheral blood lymphocytes or skin fibroblasts. Chromosomal mosaics made up of cell lines with distinct intrachromosomal structural rearrangements are unusual. Two cases reported by Reardon et al. (1981) and by Fogu et al . (2008) showed similar karyotypes with rear rengements of the same region on isochromosome 13 derivative. We sug gest a common mechanism producing the coexistence of distinct structural rearrangements at common breakpoints on chromosome 13.Phenotype of the baby is discussed with respect to other cases showing par tial trisomy mosaicism in Patau syndrome.",2014
21719,"Trisomy 9 mosaicism is considered to be a rare chromosomal abnormality with limited survival and a characteristic pattern of multiple anomalies. The features commonly associated with trisomy 9 include growth retardation, facial dysmorphisms, skeletal abnormalities, congenital heart disease and intellectual disability. More than 50 cases have been reported, most of which were diagnosed after birth. We report a case of a one month old baby girl with craniofacial abnormalities, hydronephrosis and multiple contractures. ArrayCGH analysis was performed and detected a trisomy 9 mosaicism in approximately 40% of the cells. Classical karyotyping of lymphocytes re vealed trisomy in about 3% of the metaphases. Previous prenatal analysis of cell cultures from amniotic fluid had not shown the mosaic trisomy 9 constitution. Mosaicisms are expected to be exhibited at different levels in different tissues. In addition, cell culturing leads to a bias in terms of the ra tio between trisomic and disomic clones and very likely underestimates the percentage of trisomic cells in conventional karyotyping. Our data show the importance of using uncultured samples (amniotic fluid and blood) and the value of microarray technology in the assessment of mosaicisms.",2014
21720,"The following is the case of a patient born 2 weeks preterm weighing 2.800 kg. She had a multicystic kidney that was removed immediately after birth. At age 9, due to a significant growth delay, a cytogenetic analysis was made on peripheral blood revealing a homogeneous 45,X karyotype thus leading to Turner syndrome. Growth hormone treatment contributed to stature in crease but with the development of secondary sex characters and the men strual cycle, it became necessary to repeat blood cytogenetic analysis that confirmed the 45,X karyotype. At 30 years, following absence of menstrual cycle , she realized she was pregnant. She had to undergo a caesarian deli very and was simultaneously operated for ovariectomy. Karyotype obtained from gonadic tissue was mos 45,X/46,X,der(X). The insufficient amount of cells however did not help to investigate on marker nature. As the daugh ter presented the same stature growth delay, at 5 years her constitutional karyotype was analyzed and was the same one found in her motherÃ¢ÂÂs ova rian culture: 46,X,der(X), in this case present homogeneously. Cytogenetic molecular characterization by FISH with various X specific probes allowed to define, beyond doubt, that the X derivative is a dicentric isochromosome with an inactive centromere and with symmetric point in Xp21: 46,X,idic(X)(qterÃ¢ÂÂp21::p21Ã¢ÂÂqter).

Chromosomal examination revealed normal male karyotype 46, XY. The whole genome genotyping was performed using SNP array (300K, Illumina) and no pathogenic CNV was found. However, three extensive blocks with loss of heterozygosity span ning almost one third of the whole chromosome 16 were found. Parental DNAs were analyzed and the maternal UPD16 was confirmed. Chromosome 16 showed the mixture of isodisomy and heterodisomy with homozygous haplotype within the centromere. This haplotype arrangement implies the following origin of the UPD16: meiosis II nondisjunction, recombination and mitotic loss of the paternal chromosome 16 (trisomy rescue). Data for UPD16 are inconsistent, prominent phenotype of maternal UPD16 is IUGR with or without catch up growth. Other features may include heart defects, inguinal hernia, hypospadia, pulmonary hypoplasia, although these features may be partly due to hidden mosaic trisomy 16. Mental development ranges from normal to severely delayed. We consider a potential impact of two im printed genes and five predicted imprinted genes on chromosome 16 to the distinct phenotype of the UPD16.",2014
21722,"Background: Brittle cornea syndrome (BCS) and Axenfeld Rieger syn drome (ARS) are disorders affecting the anterior segment of the eye, often leading to secondary glaucoma. BCS is an autosomal recessive disorder as sociated with mutations in the PRDM5 and ZNF469 genes, while Axenfeld Rieger syndrome is inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion that has been associated with genetic defects in PITX2 and FOXC1. The purpose of current study is to identify the underlying genetic causes in a family with autosomal recessive BCS and in a family with autosomal dominant ARS by whole exome sequencing (WES).Methods: WES was performed for a single affected individual of both fa milies. Missense, nonsense and splice site variants identified by WES were prioritized based on pathogenicity prediction scores (PhyloP , Grantham). Se gregation analysis of selected variants was performed in family members. Results: A homozygous splice site variant (c.93+5G>A) was identified in the PRDM5 gene, which was found to segregate with the disease in the BCS family. In the ARS family, a novel heterozygous PRDM5 missense variant (c.877A>G; p. Lys293Glu) was prioritized from the WES data, and was found to segregate with the disease in an autosomal dominant fashion. Both va riants were absent from population matched controls, the Exome Variant Server and an in house exome variant database. Conclusions: In the current study we identified a homozygous splice site variant in a BCS family and a heterozygous missense variant in an ARS family in the PRDM5 gene. This suggests that genetic variants in PRDM5 can lead to different disorders affecting the anterior segment. ABSTRACTS POSTERS ESHG 2014 | MILAN, ITALY | WWW. ESHG. ORG 236Back to inde x",2014
21723,"Wolf Hirschhorn Syndrome (WHS, OMIM194190) is a contiguous gene syn drome caused by partial deletion of the short arm of one chromosome 4. The core WHS phenotype includes growth delay, intellectual disability, di stinctive facial appearance and seizures. It maps within the terminal 1.9 Mb region on 4p16.3, where the critical region, WHSCR 2, was described. With respect to pathogenic genes falling within WHSCR 2, WHSC1 is the major candidate gene for both facial characteristics and growth delay. WHSC1 is expressed mainly in embryonic tissues and presents homology with Dro sophila dismorphy genes. Its PWWP , HMG box, PHD and SET structural do mains suggest an histone methyltransferase activity and a role in the epige netic regulation of morphogenetic transcriptional programmes. However, to which extent whsc1 expression and activity are reduced in patientsÃ¢ÂÂcells due to 4p16 deletion has not been thoroughly investigated. Additionally, while very little is known about whsc1 regulation, it is intriguing that this gene is a potential target of hsa miR948, that also maps to 4p16.3, and whose con comitant deletion may, in a subset of patients, reduce the effect of WHSC1 monosomy by increasing the expression of the residual allele. Based on the se consideration, we decided to evaluate at a mRNA and protein level the ex pression of WHSC1 and of hsa miR948 in primary and immortalized cell li nes from selected patients and healthy individuals as controls. Furthermore, the expression levels have been correlated with biochemical characteristics (H3K36 and H4K20 methylation) and cellular phenotypes (DNA damage response, inflammatory signaling) reportedly related to WHSC1 biological activity at least in tumor cells.",2014
21724,"Williams syndrome is a multi system disorder characterized by distincti ve facial features, growth delay, mental retardation with typical neurobe havioral profile, cardiovascular anomalies, endocrine anomalies including autoimmune pathologies, and hypercalcemia. Coeliac disease is an autoim mune, gastrointestinal disorders characterized by intolerance to the dietary grain protein gluten. An increased prevalence of Coeliac disease has been reported in Down syndrome and Turner syndrome, but there has been only few previous report which respect to the association of Coeliac disease in Williams syndrome. The aim of this study was to estimate the prevalence of Coeliac disease in our 24 molecularly confirmed Williams syndrome patients (12 girls, 12 boys, mean age 9.4 years). All patients were analysed by the dosage of tissue transglutaminases IgA and IgG HLA genotyping and intestinal biopsy was performed to the patients with positive serology. Celiac disease symptoms and gastrointestinal problems were recorded. Biochemical profile (calcium, urine calcium/creatinin ratio, thyroid functions), IgA tissue transglutamina ses (IgA tTG) and IgG tissue transglutaminases (IgG tTG) were assessed in all cases. Serum total IgA levels assessed only in tTG positive patients. Pati ents were selected for the haplotypes in the HLA class II region (HLA DQ), endoscopy and intestinal biopsy on the basis of tTG positivity. The results show that the prevalence of Coeliac disease in Williams syndro me was higher than in the general population. As our results, Coeliac disease questioning and serologic screening is recommended at certain intervals in all cases with Williams syndrome to explain the cause of growth retardation and gastrointestinal problems.",2014
21725,"Wolfram Syndrome type 2 (WFS2) is considered a phenotypic and genotypic variant of WFS, whose minimal criteria for diagnosis are diabetes mellitus and optic atrophy. The responsible gene for WFS2 is named CISD2, a highly conserved zinc finger gene encoding for the Endoplasmic Reticulum Intermembrane Small (ERIS) protein, which plays a pivotal role in calcium homeostasis. It was identified for the first time in three consanguineous families of Jordanian descents who carried a point mutation in exon 2 that disrupts messenger RNA splicing by eliminating exon 2, causing a premature stop codon. After this first report of Jordanian patients, no further CISD2 mutations have been reported worldwide. We describe the first case in Europe of WFS2 with a novel homozygous CISD2 exon 2 deletion in a 17 year old girl, identified using both PCR and high density SNP array. She presented diabetes mellitus, optic neuropathy, intestinal ulcers, sensorineural hearing loss, and defective platelet aggrega tion. Her brother and parents carried the heterozygous mutation and were apparently healthy, although they showed subclinical defective platelet ag gregation. Since the mutation had never been reported, consanguinity was hypothe sized. Long runs of homozygosity analysis from SNP array data did not show any degree of parental relationship, while microsatellite analysis confirmed the hypothesis of a common ancestor. This report provides novel clinical and molecular insights about WFS2.",2014

Women with tXY show a mild phenotype due to X inactivation and are fertile. Men with tXY show a range of phenotypes with variable degree of severity according to the size and position of the deletion of the X chromosome, comprising short stature, chondrodysplasia punctata, ichthyosis, ocular albinism, mental retardation, and Kallmann syndrome (KS). Here we describe a boy with tXY inherited from a carrier mother. His phenotype was characterized by mesomelic short stature, mid face retrusion, ichthyosis, micropenis, bilateral undescended testes, hypo plastic scrotum, agenesis of right kidney and central hypogonadism as as sessed by gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) and human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) stimulation tests. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the olfactory tracts showed hypoplastic olfactory bulbs bilaterally, aplasia of the left olfactory sulcus and hypoplasia of the right olfactory sulcus. The patientÃ¢ÂÂs mother and sister showed mesomelic short stature and his mother displayed Madelung deformity. Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array analysis defined the breakpoint in intron 7 of the KAL1 gene. Conclusion: For early diagnosis in patients with KS, it would be useful to search for other symptoms including renal abnormalities (agenesis of right kidney) and to assess the presence of olfactory tracts by MRI (hypoplastic olfactory bulbs bilaterally).",2014

21729,"The tumor suppressor genes MTS1 and MTS2 are cycline dependent kinas inhibitors inactivated in some human neoplasms via several mechanisms such as hypermethylation. We have investigated the methylation status of MTS1 and MTS2 in its effect on transcriptional down regulation in 125 bone marrow aspirate (7 cases T cell and 118 cases B cell phenotypes) from childhood ALL patient and 100 healthy control in north Indian population by using MSP PCR ,bisulfite sequencing, SQRT PCR and RT PCR. There were significant differences in pattern of hypermethylation between patients and healthy controls of MTS2 (p,0.000) and MTS1 (p,0.001) and also when both genes methylated. Patients with hypermethylated of both genes showed an increasing risk for 2.33 fold (95%CI,2.33(1.97 2.77), p,0.03). Significant association of MTS1 hypermethylation was observed only among the male patients (p,0.004) in contrast hypermethylation of MTS2 was significantly associated with increasing risk of ALL among both genders. Down regulati on of mRNA expression was found in cases in which MTS1 and MTS2 were hypermethylated. In conclusion our data also indicate the impact of hyper methylation mediated inactivation of these genes which is associated with risk of childhood ALL. This abnormality particularly in promoter of MTS2 occurs in leukemogenesis and can be considered as an important factor in predicting the clinical outcome of ALL and it is able to suggest a diagnostic tool for some stage of ALL and even provide the better prospective for treat ment strategy by applying some demathylating agents.",2014
21730,"The etiology of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is currently unknown alt hough genetic background and environmental exposure postulated to be a possible cause of AML development. The CYP2B6 enzyme plays a vital role in the degradation of many genotoxic compounds, protecting cells from oxitative damage. CYP2B6 gene is subjected to the A785G germline poly morphism which reduces enzyme activity. Thus, individuals homozygous or heterozygous for mutant allele (G/G or A/G) present decreased enzymatic activity. The purpose of this study was to investigate the role of the A785G polymorphism in the AML susceptibility. Possible associations with specific AML chromosomal abnormalities were also investigated. CYP2B6 genoty ping was performed in 220 de novo AML patients and 243 healthy donors by RCR RFLP and Real Time PCR assays. Cytogenetic analysis was successful in 98% of patients. Among them, 72.7% presented an abnormal karyotype. A significantly higher incidence of the mutant genotypes (A/G and G/G) was observed in de novo AML patients compared to the controls (p<0.0001).

Conven tional cytogenetics was supplemented by FISH analysis using specific probes for the centromeric alpha satellite region of chromosome 1 (D1Z7; 1p11.1 q11), chromosomes 14/22 (D14Z1/D22Z1; 14p11.1 q11.1/22p11.1 q11.1), and chromosome 15 (D15Z4; 15p11.1 q11.1). FISH analysis showed that the signal of chromosome 1 alphoid region D1Z7 was absent on derivative chromosomes in all patients suggesting that breakpoint on chromosome 1q is distal to the centromere, while D14Z1 on t(1;14), D15Z4 on t(1;15), and D22Z1 on t(1;22) were present.

However, it is not known whether the loss of APC function can occur even through alternative genetic and epigenetic mechanisms. In this study, we investigated the methylation profile of 34 tumor suppressor genes, Copy Number Alterations (CNA) of 52 chromosomal regions, and APC alterations (mutation, methylation, and loss) together with the measurement of APC mRNA level in 45 ACCs and related available peritumoral pancreatic tissu es using different methodologies: MS MLPA, FISH, mutation analysis, and reverse transcription droplet digital PCR. ACCs did not show an extensive global gene hypermethylation profile. RASSF1 and APC were the only two genes frequently methylated (60% and 56% of cases, respectively). APC mutations were found in 7% of cases, while APC loss and methylation were more frequently observed (48% and 56% of ACCs, respectively). They were also found in pancreatic tissues adjacent to ACCs showing these alterations. APC mRNA low levels were found in 58% of cases and correlated with high er levels of CNAs. In conclusions, ACCs are frequently polysomic and mainly characterized by CNAs and gene methylation. APC alterations are crucial events in the pathogenesis of ACCs and the reduction of APC mRNA levels mainly depends on gene loss and promoter hypermethylation rather than gene mutation.",2014

The ability to repair DNA damage is strongly associated with the risk of cancer and inter individual variation in DNA repair capacity (DRC) might account for different susceptibility of developing cancer. DRC represents a complex marker comprising the sum of several factors such as gene vari ants, gene expression, stability of gene products, and effect of inhibitors/stimulators. Individuals with low DRC will tend to accumulate more damage than those who have a better ability to repair such damage. This variability is modulated by the genetic background to which SNPs/haplotype combi nations in DNA repair genes, as well as epigenetic regulation are likely to contribute. Phenotypic assays to evaluate DNA repair activity (in particular NER comet assay, H2AX phosphorylation and micronucleus assay) were performed on cryopreserved lymphocytes from 159 bladder cancer cases (collected before treatment) and 159 controls matched by age and smoking habits, enrolled in Turin Bladder Cancer Study (TBCS). We aimed at studying the relationship between DRC (evaluated by comet assay, micronuclei and H2AX phosphorylation assay) and bladder cancer integrating, gene expression and epigenetic profile data (methylation levels and microRNA expression). In particular, we performed an integrated analysis on the genotype/pheno type correlation in a population of bladder cancer cases and controls pro vided with detailed description of the follow up for response to therapy/recurrence/survival.

The present study involves male subjects recruited between 1994 and 2012 and diagnosed with BC. Urine samples have been collected for the first time at the time of diagnosis and exfoliated cells have been extracted. A subgroup of patients have been followed up for three years, collecting a urine sample every six months. The mutation spectrum of hTERT , FGFR3, HRAS, KRAS, NRAS and PIK3CA in 286 patients has been investigated at diagnosis. Thirty eight patients have completed six samplings, twenty five patients have five samplings and nineteen patients have four samplings, for a total of 454 follow up samples. Mutations are detected using three different multiplex ed SNaPshot assays. The first allows to detect in one reaction the nine most frequent FGFR3 mutations. The second multiplex screens simultaneously for nineteen RAS mutations. The last multiplex detects seven mutations, three in hTERT gene and four in PIK3CA gene. Preliminary analyses show that mu tations in hTERT gene promoter and in FGFR3 gene are the most frequent somatic mutations in tumours of the urinary bladder.

Preliminary data on 14 samples, already analysed using Sanger method, were obtained using the BRCA1/2 Ion Ampliseq kit on Ion Torrent PGM: data indicated a reliable and robust variant identification and sequence coverage ranging from 99.995 to 100%. Data comparison will be presented for 40 patients. In addition, recent data suggest that consti tutive epimutations in BRCA1 might be relevant to breast carcinogenesis. We identified in a pilot study on Sequenom MassARRAY system that blood DNA from BC patients (negative for BRCA1/2 mutations) was consistently more methylated in a region corresponding to chr17:38531627 38532076, compared to controls (60 90% vs 30 40%). Therefore an epigenetic and quantitative expression analysis of BRCA1 is currently carried out in a lar ger group of patients with or without BRCA mutations, and controls, in or der to establish a correlation between the degree of methylation and the expression levels in our cohort of patients.

21737,"The most commonly mutated high penetrance genes in hereditary breast and ovarian cancer (HBOC) are BRCA1 and BRCA2. Germline loss of function mutations in these genes confer a high risk of breast cancer to the individual carrier. However, besides the clear loss of function mutations, there are still a large number of sequence variants of uncertain clinical significance (VUS) in both genes. These VUS generate a huge challenge both for genetic counse ling and prophylactic surgery. In the current study, the consequences of some BRCA1 and BRCA2 VUS iden tified in Norwegian cancer patients were evaluated. Initially, their possible influence on RNA splicing was investigated by targeted sequencing of cDNA. In addition, the complete BRCA1 and BRCA2 cDNA were sequenced in order to uncover eventual alternatively spliced transcripts. Some of the variants affecting the BRCT domains of BRCA1 were tested for their influence on BRCA1 trans activation function. In total, 19 individuals with BRCA1 VUS and 18 individuals with BRCA2 VUS from families with HBOC were included in this study. Three of the variants, BRCA1 c.213 5T>A, BRCA1 c.5434C>G and BRCA2 c.68 7T>A, were shown to influence RNA splicing. Investigation of the full length cDNA of BRCA1 and BRCA2 proved to be challenging due to the presence of several alternatively spliced transcripts which were also present in the controls. A functional assay, developed to assess the trans activation ability of BRCA1, indicated that some of the variants may have a deleterious effect.",2014

Here we describe genetic and clinical data of two fe male double heterozygotes for both BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations found in a cohort of 201 mutated Italian breast/ovarian cancer families out of 942 cases analyzed. The first one is a female patient affected by bilateral breast cancer at 47 and 49 years of age, carrying both a BRCA2 nonsense mutati ons (c.7408A>T p.

21739,"Introduction: BRCA mutation carriership affects treatment, follow up and further cancer prevention in patients newly diagnosed with breast or ovari an cancer. Therefore indications for BRCA mutation testing grow rapidly. We investigate prospectively 1) the frequency of BRCA mutation carriers among unselected breast and ovarian cancer patients, 2) current criteria for BRCA mutation testing by age and family history, and 3) psychosocial effects of BRCA mutation testing in newly diagnosed patients. Materials and methods: BRCA mutation testing is offered consecutively since September 2012 (ongoing) to unselected newly diagnosed patients with breast or ovarian cancer at four hospitals in Western Norway. Initial testing is performed by a selected panel of 40 most frequent BRCA mutati ons, covering more than 90% of BRCA mutations in the native Norwegian population. Additionally, patients with a positive family history are invited for genetic counseling and further genetic testing. Results: By February 2014 N,208 breast cancer patients (40% response rate) and N,40 ovarian cancer patients (67% response rate) have been in cluded in the study. A pathogenic BRCA mutation has been found in 5 (2.4%) breast cancer patients and 6 (15%) ovarian cancer patients; 9 BRCA1 and 2 BRCA2 mutations. Only one of these mutation carriers would have been missed by current guidelines. 42% of the participants have been invited for genetic counseling. Conclusion: Less than half of the patients with breast cancer and two thirds of patients with ovarian cancer choose genetic testing at diagnosis. The in cidence of BRCA mutations is particularly high among unselected patients with ovarian cancer. The updated results will be presented.",2014
21740,"The RNU2 macrosatellite is a tandem array of a 6.1 kb repeat unit contai ning the 190 bp long gene coding for snRNA U2, RNU2 1 , and 3.8 kb of in terspersed repetitive DNA. Although located 124 kb telomeric to the breast and ovarian cancer susceptibility gene BRCA1, the RNU2 locus is absent from the human genome assembly due to the inherent difficulty to assemble repetitive sequences. Thus, the influence that these large tandem repeat ar rays might exert on neighbouring gene expression, stability or architecture and their contribution to the genetic basis of common human diseases re mains largely unexplored. We have recently characterized in more details the RNU2 locus and tested the association between RNU2 copy number and breast cancer risk. Indeed, the proximity of this macrosatellite to BRCA1 combined with its high degree of polymorphism raises the interesting pos sibility that it could be involved in breast cancer susceptibility, especially as no mutation is identified in BRCA1/2 in 80% of the families tested in a diagnostic setting. We conducted a case control study by genotyping the RNU2 macrosatellite with a qPCR assay in 1452 familial breast cancer ca ses, 1457 affected and unaffected relatives and 1241 unrelated controls of the French study GENESIS. We found that mean RNU2 global copy number (GCN) is higher in cases (52 copies) than in controls (50 copies). In additi on, we found more very high RNU2 GCN (>100) in affected women.

21741,"In most countries large genomic rearrangements (LGRs) in BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes occur in a small percentage of patients tested for hereditary breast ovarian cancer. Instead, in the Greek population, four specific LGRs have been identified in BRCA1 [deletions of exon 20 (4kb), exon 20 (3kb), exon 24 (4,5kb), and exons 23 24 (11kb)], the latter three of which have been characterized as founder mutations. Several factors may be associated with LGRs, such as younger age at breast cancer (BC) diagnosis, bilaterallity and estrogen receptorÃ¢ÂÂnegative status. The studyÃ¢ÂÂs objective was to assess the possible establishment of criteria leading to targeted screening, as well as to increase our insight into the role and clinical significance of specific BRCA1 pathogenic findings. In a cohort of 2.100 hereditary BC or OC patients, 74 (3,5%) were found to carry one of the four LGRs. We have investigated the possible associati on between BRCA1 LGRs and the aforementioned factors. The mean age at diagnosis was 40,6 years. Among the 74 patients, 43 (60%) developed BC, 15 (20%) both BC and OC, where 16 (20%) developed OC only. 14 out of 74 developed bilateral (3/14), contralateral (9/14) and ipsilateral (2/14) BC. Histopathology data was available for 40 out of 58 BC patients, demonstra ting that 29/40 (72%) were triple negative, 6/40 (15%) were ER+/PR+/Her2 , 3 (7,5%) were ER /PR /Her2+, 1 (2,5%) was ER+/PR /Her2 and 1 (2,5%) was ER+/PR+/Her2+.In conclusion, LGRs compared to other loss of function mutations of BRCA1 gene do not seem to be associated with specific clinical or histopathological features.",2014

Otx1 is an homeobox gene involved in central nervous system development, and when deregulated, plays a role in tumorigenesis. We showed that Otx1 is over expressed in ductal and lobular invasive breast cancers and that is involved in adult mammary gland deve lopment. We demonstrated that p53 directly regulates Otx1 gene expression binding to the 3Ã¢ÂÂp53 responsive element (RE) on its promoter, and that this pathway regulates the LA7 breast CSCs differentiation. Here we will show that the TAp73ÃÂ± isoform of p73 is able to bind the 5Ã¢ÂÂp53RE on the Otx1 pro moter, leading to the LA7 cell differentiation and the asymmetric division of breast CSCs.

21743,"The antiquity of the Greeks as a population defined by language and culture, and the complexity of Greek historical demography, present challenges to genetic testing for predisposition to cancer. The Greek population harbors ancient founder mutations in many genes, including five BRCA1 damaging alleles, as well as many disease alleles that are specific to one or a few fa milies. The aim of this study was to identify loss of function mutations in 22 genes in 736 patients with breast cancer diagnosed at a young age (<35 years) or with a strong family history of breast, ovarian, and/or pancreatic cancer. Targeted capture and multiplexed sequencing was carried out using BROCA, which captures the entire loci of 22 genes. Of 736 patients with young onset or familial breast cancer, 252 (34%) carried loss of function mutations in one of 11 genes. Frequencies were: 103 BRCA1 founders, 61 other BRCA1, 45 BRCA2, 29 CHEK2, 7 PALB2, 7 ATM, 2 PTEN and 1 in each in RAD51C, FAM175A, BRIP1, PIK3CA and TP53. PALB2 p. R753X was observed in four Greek families and may be a founder allele. We conclude that among Greek patients with familial or early onset breast cancer more than a third carry loss of function mutations in a breast cancer related gene. Founder mutati ons account for about 50% of the BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutational burden and about 40% of the mutational burden in all known and candidate breast can cer genes. Given genetic heterogeneity, patients benefit from an approach that detects all classes of mutations in known breast cancer genes.",2014

Heterozygotes for mutations in CHEK2 and NBN genes were found to be as sociated with increased risk of developing cancers, including breast cancer (BC). The aim of our study was to determine the frequency of three common mutations in CHEK2 gene (1100delÃÂ¡, I157T and IVS2+1G>A) and two mu tations in NBN gene (R215W and 657del5) among Macedonian BC patients and controls from the general population. For this purpose we have designed a multiplex PCR followed by SNaPshot analysis. A total of 299 BC patients, of whom 112 with a cancer family history and 283 controls were included in the study. Mutations were more frequent among BC patients (n,13, 4.3%) than among controls (n,5, 1.8%), although without statistical significance. Twelve patients were heterozygous for one of the analyzed mutations, while one patient had two mutations (NBN R215W and CHEK2 I157T). The most frequent mutation was CHEK2 I157T , found in 10 BC patients and 4 controls. The frequency of this mutation was statistically higher among BC patients with a cancer family history when compared to the controls (p,0.028). NBN R215W was found in one BC patient and one control, while CHEK2 1100delC and NBN 657del5 were found each in one BC patient and no control. CHEK2 IVS2+1G>A has not been found in our study.

21745,"Hereditary breast and ovarian cancer (HBOC) accounts for about 10% of all breast cancers and BRCA1 and BRCA2 are the most prevalent genes cau sing this pathology. BRCA1/BRCA2 germline mutations escalate the risk of developing HBOCs by up to 20 fold. Testing for BRCA gene mutations is im portant to improve the clinical management of the high risk patients and of their mutation carriers family members. A NGS screening for BRCA1/2 germline mutations of 300 patients, with early onset breast cancer (Ã¢ÂÂunder fortyÃ¢ÂÂ) and/or with positive family histo ry, is reported in order to identify mutation carriers.

21746,"The MRE11A RAD50 Nibrin (MRN) complex plays several critical roles re lated to repair of DNA double strand breaks. Inherited biallelic mutations in any one of the three components predispose to genetic instability disorders. Inherited heterozygous mutations in the MRN genes have been implicated in breast cancer (BC) susceptibility, but the underlying data are not entirely convincing. In order to verify if rare MRN variants are intermediate risk BC susceptibility alleles, we mutation screened the coding exons and proximal splice junctions of the MRN genes in 1,313 early onset BC cases and 1,123 population controls. Considering the extremely low frequency of likely pathogenic variants in these genes in the general population, we have decided to evaluate the genes as if they constitute one relatively large gene (though still smaller than ATM, another gene in the same pathway).Limiting our analyses to variants with MAF<0.1% and combining protein truncating variants, likely spliceogenic variants, and key functional domain rare missense substitutions, we found significant evidence that the MRN ABSTRACTS POSTERS ESHG 2014 | MILAN, ITALY | WWW.

Petrov Institute of Oncology, St. Petersburg, Russian Federation, 3St. Petersburg Pediatric Medical Academy, St. Petersburg, Russian Federation, 4Institute for Molecular Medicine Finland, Helsinki, Finland. Virtually all known tumor predisposing genes have been identified via the analysis of familial cancer cases. Here we argue that this approach is likely to miss recessively acting cancer genes and suggest the analysis of family histo ry negative patients with multiple primary malignancies for identifying ho mozygous at risk genotypes. We performed calculations showing that in ca ses of transmission of a recessive cancer predisposing allele (a), which has a frequency of 0.1 and a penetrance of 100%, only a minority of patients with the aa genotype (19%) will have one or both parents with the same genotype and hence report a family history of cancer. Therefore, while the focus on familial cancer clustering is a powerful tool for identifying dominant mutati ons, the cases of disease caused by the homozygous recessive at risk alleles may be easily missed. We further revealed that the c.2515_2519delAAGTT homozygous mutation in a Holliday junction resolvase, GEN1, was over represented in women with bilateral breast cancer (BC) as compared to healthy controls [11/360 (3.1 %) vs. 18/1305 (1.4 %); OR , 2.25 (1.02 4.75); p , 0.031], although this trend was not pronounced in unilateral BC patients. Noticeably, the presence of biallelic c.2515_2519delAAGTT muta tion was associated with the absence of BC in mothers of both bilateral and unilateral BC patients [7/239 (3.0 %) vs. 0/41 (0 %) and 21/1,558 (1.3 %) vs. 0/215 (0 %), respectively; p , 0.041].

DNA was isolated from all samples, enriched and sequenced on the Illumina MiSeq (2x 150 bp paired end) following standard protocols. For diagnostic genes, regions with low depth (< 20x) were complemented by Sanger se quencing as well as MLPA. All mutations were confirmed by conventional Sanger sequencing. Results: So far, we have sequenced 100 hereditary breast cancer patients. Overall 91 99 % of all targeted exons were represented with a Ã¢ÂÂdiagnosticÃ¢ÂÂ average depth of > 20x. Roughly 70 SNVs were identified per sample and stringent filtering resulted in less than seven variants for validation. We identified 15 mutations that are known to cause HBOC as well as muta tions likely to cause HBOC. Further experiments and segregation analysis is required to determine the pathogenicity in the latter. In addition hete rozygous mutations were found in genes relevant for different autosomal recessive cancer syndromes.

One mutation (c.1027C>T; p. Gln343X) recurred in three cases, two of whom originally from the province of Bergamo. The genotyping of the c.1027C>T in 113 BRCAX cases ascertained at Azienda Ospedaliera HPG23 of Bergamo, detected a total of 6 carriers (5.3%), while only 2 carriers were observed among 477 female blood donors recruited in the same area (0.4%). The estimated age adjusted odds ratio of these fre quencies was 13.4 (95% confidence interval: 2.7Ã¢ÂÂ67.4). This value is similar to those previously observed for a few PALB2 mutations recurrent in other countries and suggests that the c.1027C>T is associated with a relatively high breast cancer risk.

Breast cancer is the most common tumor in women, and the second leading cause of death. Tumor cells invasiveness is mainly due to an alteration of cell cell and cell matrix connections. Thus, an altered expression of adhesi on molecules and their receptors is a crucial event in this process. Among them, semaphorins, a large family of transmembrane or secreted molecules that regulate cell migration and adhesion, are of peculiar interest. A growing number of studies and our recent work on SEMA6B in breast cancer among these has demonstrated their involvement in cancer progression, often with divergent functions. In order to simultaneously investigate gene expression and alternative splicing for all the genes encoding adhesion molecules, and particularly for semaphorins, their receptors and co receptors, we performed RNA Sequen cing experiment on MCF 7 cells, a well established and widely used cellular model of breast cancer. Interesting preliminary results were obtained, parti cularly for SEMA3F gene. Indeed, we identified a novel transcript generated by alternative splicing, predicted to encode for a truncated semaphorin. Mo reover, through semiquantitative PCR and quantitative Real Time assay we measured SEMA3F expression on a panel of breast cancer tissues compared to their healthy counterpart. The analysis revealed a strong and significant up regulation of SEMA3F in breast cancer and, intriguingly, the sole pres ence in the healthy tissues of the newly identified transcript.

The aim of our study was to investigate the prevalence of variants at these three loci in a specific Irish subpopulation, and to examine the association between these variants and breast cancer in this cohort. Methods: DNA was extracted from the whole blood of patients with breast cancer and from healthy female controls using a salting out method. Geno typing of each sample for each of the three targets was carried out using a TaqmanÃÂ® based platform. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS software after testing for Hardy Weinberg equilibrium. Results: A total of 1639 samples were included in the study group, com prising 1191 cases and 448 controls. The minor allele at locus 12p11 was found to confer a significant protective effect, with a per allele odds ratio of 0.7 (0.5 0.9, p,0.002, X2). The minor allele at 12q24 had a slight protective effect (per allele OR ,0.9 (0.8 1.1, p ,0.29, X2)). The minor allele 21q21 did not confer a protective effect, and was in disequilibrium as per test of Hardy Weinberg.

In routine diagnostics of hBC/OC two methods: biochip based approach and real time PCR were used for the analysis of founder mutati ons in Russian Federation, namely, 185delAG, 300T>G, 4153delA, 4158A>G, 5382insC, 6174delT , 1100delC. However, only 15% of patients were found to carry the BRCA1/2 or CHEK2 mutation. Other genes, like TP53, PALB2, ATM, BRIP1, RAD50, BLM and so on, are widely tested in patients with hBC/OC susceptibility. The aim was to study an impact of TP53 germline mutations and polymorphisms into predisposition to bilateral BC and/or secondary primary multiple neoplasia (SPMN). Genomic DNA was isolated and exons 4 11 of ÃÂ¢ÃÂ 53 gene were amplified with commercial primer set SeqPlateTP53. Next generation sequencing was performed using a platform GS Junior (454/Roche). The results were validated by Sanger sequencing. Exons 4 11 of TP53 gene in 22 patients with SPMN including BC or bilateral BC and without founder mutations in BRCA genes (wtBRCA) were analy zed. The findings included several rare variants with population frequency less than 0.001%. Previously found nonsense mutation 2637ÃÂ¡/T , leading to stop codon instead of arginine (codon 306) in patient with bilateral BC was confirmed by NGS. A heterozygous germline missense mutation in codon 241 (ÃÂ.722ÃÂ¡>A) was diagnosed in patient with SPMN (Li Fraumeni syndro me). The mutation was confirmed by Sanger sequencing. The data demon strated the clinical utility of TP53 testing in selected patients with SPMN and/or bilateral BC.",2014
21755,"Next generation sequencing (NGS) allows the production of large volumes of sequence data (and potentially genetic results) and the ethical and prac tical issues regarding feedback of results become particularly pertinent to address. Should (any) results be given to research participants? If so, which results and who should provide them? Within two EU funded projects in oncology (CAGEKID and EUROTARGET), in order to gather researchersÃ¢ÂÂ and health care professionalsÃ¢ÂÂ views and experiences on providing results we distributed a questionnaire to attendees of genetics meetings in Europe in 2013.Of the 95 respondents, 88% work as researchers and/or clinicians in a field related to oncology and half (52%) use NGS in some aspect of their work; 56% of respondents state that they provide specific information about NGS to participants or patients before enrolling them in a study or using their samples for sequencing. The majority, 83% had never received requests from physicians or patients for access to NGS data to inform treatment de cisions. Regarding feedback of results in a research setting, 54% or respon dents think that results stemming from NGS studies should be provided to individual participants and 72% think that actionable incidental findings should be disclosed to participants. Finally, 53% of respondents think that specific measures and/or limitations should be implemented for the sha ring of NGS data/results with colleagues in the scientific community. Such empirical data from stakeholders is a valuable contribution to the ongoing discussion of how to responsibly handle and feedback results to patients and research subjects.

21756,"Alterations in the genome that lead to changes in DNA sequence copy number are characteristic features of solid tumors. In this study, we used GGH+SNP microarray technique for detailed screening of copy number al terations (CNAs) in a cohort of 26 patients with uterine cervical carcinoma (UCC), and the findings were correlated with the incidence of lymph node metastasis and lymphangioinvasion. The whole genome screening discove red CNAs in 73.1% of samples. Frequent areas of gains were observed in 3q (50.0%), 1q (42.4%), 19q (23.1%), while losses were commonly observed in 11q (30.8%), 4q (23.1%), 13q and 2q (both 19.2%). Regions of loss of he terozygosity were observed in 15.4% in 11q23, 14q21, 18q12.2 and 8q21. The incidence of gain 3q was associated with gain 1q (P,.033), while loss of 4p was commonly observed with loss of 13q (P,.010). Higher occurrence of CNAs was associated with patients under 45 years (P,.016). Patients with adenocarcinoma have statistical trend to carry genomic profiles without CNAs (P,.051). Incidence of lymph node metastases was associated higher number of CNAs (12 vs 9; P,0.452) and patients without LVSI had trend to higher incidence of gains in chromosome 15q. Taking together array CGH techniques allowed us to precisely detect specific cytogenetic lesions in UCC, which can be used for prognosis of the disease as well as novel genomic markers associated with the development of invasive cervical cancer.

21757,"Cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) presents significant diagnostic challenges, re sulting in late patient diagnosis and poor survival rates. Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis (PSC) patients pose a particularly difficult clinical dilemma, since they harbor chronic biliary strictures that are difficult to distinguish from CCA. MicroRNAs (miRs) have recently emerged as a valuable class of diagnostic markers; however, thus far, neither extracellular vesicles (EVs) nor miRs within EVs have been investigated in human bile. We aimed to comprehensively characterize human biliary EVs, including their miR con tent. Conclusion: We have established the presence of extracellular vesicles in human bile. In addition, we have demonstrated that human biliary EVs contain abundant miR species, which are stable and therefore amenable to the development of disease marker panels. Furthermore, we have charac terized the protein content, size, numbers and size distribution of human biliary EVs. Utilizing Multivariate Organization of Combinatorial Altera tions (MOCA), we defined a novel biliary vesicle miR based panel for CCA diagnosis which demonstrated a sensitivity of 67% and specificity of 96%. Importantly, our control group contained 13 PSC patients, 16 patients with biliary obstruction of varying etiologies (including benign biliary stricture, papillary stenosis, choledocholithiasis, extrinsic compression from pancrea tic cysts, and cholangitis), and 3 patients with bile leak syndromes. Clinical ly, these types of patients present with a biliary obstructive clinical picture that could be confused with CCA. These findings establish the importance of using extracellular vesicles, rather than whole bile, for developing miR based disease markers in bile.",2014
21758,"Chordoma, originating from notochord remnants, is characterized by chemo resistance. Since the apoptotic Fas/Fasl pathway is involved in notochordal cell apoptosis, we investigated its possible role in chordoma. Accordingly we detected the lack of FASL mRNA and the presence of both FAS anti and pro apoptotic isoforms and the inactive Caspases 8 and 3 forms in most of the tumors analyzed, suggesting the Fas/Fasl pathway inactivation in chor doma. The enhancement of apoptosis in U CH1 chordoma cells, expressing Fasl and Fas anti and pro apoptotic isoforms after Soluble Fasl treatment, indicates that this pathway can be re activated. These findings lead us to hy pothesize that Fas receptor binds Soluble Fasl that, undermining Fas antia poptotic isoform, activates apoptosis. Soluble Fas isoform could have a key role as antiapoptotic factor as the alternative splicing underlying the expres sion regulation of the two Fas isoforms. Knowing that HuR is one of the spli cing factors leading to Fas transmembrane isoform, we are performing func tional studies aimed at modulating the reciprocal amount of Fas isoforms by interfering with the expression of HuR. U CH1 apoptosis, cellular vitality and migration will be evaluated after HuR iperexpression and silencing to assess the role of Fas antiapoptotic isoform in chordoma apoptosis regulati on. We are also silencing miR 21 targeting FASL mRNA to verify whether the increase of endogenous Fasl may activate apoptosis. This study, providing findings on the involvement of Fas/Fasl pathway in chordoma could help to elucidate the role of apoptosis in chordoma tumorigenesis, addressing the identification of new potential pharmacological targets.",2014
21759,"I. Pirogov, Moscow, Russian Federation. Long term observation studies confirm high efficiency of targeted therapy of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) by tyrosine kinases inhibitors (TKI). However part of CML patients demonstrate primary resistance to TKI. This resistance appears to be connected with activation of alternative BCR ABL independent signaling pathways. Transcriptome analysis of cancer cell in CML is a perspective approach to elucidate molecular mechanisms of TKI resistance and to find new approaches to CML treatment. We aim to find and to study differences in expression levels of cancer cells in primary CML patients, who demonstrated sensitivity or resistance to TKI. Gene expres sion profiles were analyzed using Illumina HT 12 Expression Bead Chip. These chips quantitate expression levels of more than 47000 transcripts. According to European Leukemia Net (2013) criteria patients were divided into resistant to TKI therapy molecular response >10% in 6 months of the rapy and optimal responders with molecular response <1% in 6 months of therapy. Comparative transcriptome analysis revealed 2672 of differently expressed genes in responders and non responders. Enrichment analysis of the differently expressed genes showed the following molecular networks involved (p < 0,05): HTLV 1 infection (FZD10, ADCY1, MYB); PPAR signa ling pathway (SCD 1, OLR1); Transcriptional misregulation in cancer (MPO, CEBPE, ELANE); Melanogenesis (ADCY1, FZD10). Detailed analysis demon strated that all of the selected genes are overexpressed in cancer cells of pa tients sensitive to TKI therapy. Differently expressed genes and expression particularities of the selected pathways may be useful molecular markers for prognosis of the TKI therapy efficacy and may be used to optimize treat ment of CML.",2014

The aim of this study was to explore the association between polymorphis ms of three DNA repair genes (XPD, XRCC1 and XRCC4) and clinical parame ters in patients with Philadelphia positive (Ph+) Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML) treated with imatinib. Sixty two patients with CML and 70 healthy controls were examined for XPD (A 751G), XRCC1 (A399G), XRCC4 (intron 3 VNTR and G 1394T) polymorphisms. DNA was extracted from periphe ral blood samples using salting out procedure. All polymorphisms were genotyped by PCR and/or PCR RFLP and analyzed. All data were analyzed using de Finetti program and SPSS version 14.0 for Windows. No signi ficant differences were detected between CML group and healthy controls with respect to the distributions and numbers of genotypes and alleles in XPD, XRCC1 and XRCC4 ( 1394). However, intron 3 VNTR polymorphism in ABSTRACTS POSTERS ESHG 2014 | MILAN, ITALY | WWW. ESHG. ORG 245Back to inde x XRCC4 gene was showed an association with CML patients. The distribution of DD, DI and II genotypes for the gene was 3.2%, 51.6% and 45.2% in CML compared with 14.3%, 60% and 25.7% in the controls. In the univariate analyses of clinical parameters, there was no significant prognostic factor found to influence overall survival. The four factors that were predicted for better event free survival from univariate analysis were younger age (< 60) (p,0.020), absence of splenomegaly (p,0.011), lower Sokal risk score at diagnosis (p,0.0148) and XRCC1 GG genotype (p,0.033).

21761,"Long term regular use of aspirin is associated with a reduced risk of co lorectal cancer (CRC) of up to 60%. However, not all aspirin users receive the beneficial chemopreventive effect. This is potentially attributable to the presence of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in genes involved in aspirinÃ¢ÂÂs pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic pathways. We investiga ted the impact of 32 SNPs within 9 genes and 2 SNPs in intergenic regions on CRC risk using the Leeds Colorectal Cancer Panel which contains 1910 cases and 1276 controls; these SNPs were chosen for their potentially func tional effect. Sixteen out of 34 SNPs were removed from analysis as they had frequency of <3%. All remaining SNPs were in Hardy Weinberg equi librium. P values for the tests of association were adjusted for sex and age. The presence of rs11694911 T allele (OR,0.79, 95% CI,0.63 1.0, p,0.04) and rs2302615 T allele (OR,0.81, 95% CI,0.67 0.99, p,0.024) at ODC1 lo cus were associated with a reduced CRC risk. When the data was stratified (colon versus rectum), CYP2C9 rs1799853 T allele (OR,0.73, 95% CI,0.60 0.90, p,0.003) and ODC1 rs2302615 T allele (OR,0.76, 95% CI,0.61 0.93, p,0.005) showed significant association with colon cancer suggesting in fluence may be dependent on the tumor location. Both variant alleles have previously been shown to modulate chemopreventive activity of aspirin in colorectal adenoma occurrence, but this is the first dataset to indicate their effect on carcinoma risk. This data suggests that the presence of these vari ants modulates CRC risk which in turn may provide insight into the variation in aspirinÃ¢ÂÂs chemopreventive efficacy.",2014
21762,"Approximately 25 30% of colorectal cancer (CRC) cases are expected to re sult from a genetic predisposition, but only in 5 10% of these cases high penetrant germline mutations are found. Therefore, the majority of CRC heredity is still unexplained. This missing heritability is thought to result from the presence of rare variants with a moderate penetrant risk. Whole exome sequencing (WES) has made it possible to identify such risk factors. As hereditary CRC is marked by an early age of onset, we performed WES on a cohort of CRC patients (n,55) with an onset of disease before 45 years of age. To identify potentially pathogenic variants, we searched for rare prote in truncating variants or highly conserved missense variants. A total of 272 protein truncating variants and 1537 missense or in frame insertions and deletions were identified. Recurrence filtering and selection of genes poten tially involved in CRC development revealed three novel candidate genes: EMR3 , PTPN12 and LRP6 . A screen of the coding region of these genes in a cohort of early onset or familial CRC patients (n,181) revealed additio nal rare variants in PTPN12 and LRP6 . PTPN12 encodes a protein tyrosine phosphatase and is described to be a driver of cancer development. LRP6 encodes a component of the Wnt Fzd LRP5 LRP6 complex that triggers beta catenin signaling. This study contributes to the further understanding of the heterogeneity of the genetic susceptibility for CRC. Follow up studies on the frequency of mutations in these genes in larger cohorts, and their functional assessment, will provide conclusive evidence for the role of these genes in CRC development.",2014
21763,"Colorectal cancer (CRC) represents one of the most frequent neoplasms in Europe. Besides classical hereditary forms, around 30% of cases present familial aggregation mostly with an unknown inherited cause. Next genera tion sequencing permits to characterize genetic variation in one individual and to discover new disease predisposition genes. Material and methods: Patients were selected from high risk clinics from Spanish hospitals as well as from the EPICOLON consortium. Forty two in dividuals from 29 families with strong CRC aggregation compatible with an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance and without alterations in the known CRC hereditary genes were selected. Exome sequencing was perfor med in germline DNA with subsequent quality control, removal of sequen cing artifacts, data annotation and variant filtering. An automatic CRC speci fic pipeline was used for prioritization. Results: Sequencing mean coverage was >95x. Only very rare variants, pro ducing a clear loss of function and located in genes with a function related to CRC or cancer were selected as final candidates. Afterwards, they were validated by Sanger sequencing and segregation was studied in additional affected family members when available. Loss of heterozygosity in tumor DNA was analyzed in variants with correct disease segregation. Best candi date variants included those located in interesting genes such as CDKN1B, XRCC4, EPHX1, NFKBIZ, SMARCA4, BRCA2 and BARD1. Three variants are expected to abolish protein function and 4 missense changes had strongly deleterious in silico predictions. Conclusions: We identified variants in DNA repair genes that represent good candidates to become new CRC predisposition genes, some of them previously involved in other neoplasms.",2014
21764,"Johns, NL, Canada. Familial Colorectal Cancer Type X (FCCTX) is an inherited predisposition to colorectal cancer (CRC) in families fulfilling the Amsterdam I criteria. A syndrome of unknown etiology, FCCTX is genetically heterogeneous. FCCTX families appear to have a moderate to high lifetime risk of developing CRC. A cohort of 91 FCCTX patients (66 families) from the Canadian provinces of Ontario and Newfoundland & Labrador (NL) were selected for whole exome sequencing of genomic DNA. A pooled segregation analysis of all missen se variants recurrent in patients within two or more families identified 93 candidate missense variants. We then prioritized missense variants with low minor allele frequency (<1%), deleterious prediction of protein conse quence and absence of identified variants in population controls. This re fined our list of genetic culprits to variants within seven candidate genes. An age, sex and ethnically matched case control cohort will be analyzed for statistical enrichment of candidate variants. We further queried our exome data for all deleterious rare variants in a set of CRC susceptibility genes identified by review of the current literature. Among these variants we identified POLE p. L424V; a missense substitution described in several patients of families with predisposition for CRC. In a final query involving the proband of a single, large NL family, we screened the exome for variants within two regions of linkage disequilibrium on chromosome 19 (LOD 3.49, 4.51), to refine the disease locus using segregation analysis. Studies of whole exomes continue to highlight the potential for identifying rare deleterious variants in CRC families worldwide.",2014
21765,"Objective: Recognizing colorectal cancer (CRC) patients with Lynch syndro me (LS) can increase life expectancy of these patients and their close re latives. To improve identification of this under diagnosed disease, experts suggested raising the age limit for CRC tumour genetic testing from 50 to 70 years. The present study evaluates the efficacy and cost effectiveness of this strategy. Design: Probabilistic efficacy and cost effectiveness analyses were perfor med comparing tumour genetic testing of CRC diagnosed at age 70 or below (experimental strategy) versus CRC diagnosed at age 50 or below (current practice). The proportions of LS patients identified and cost effectiveness including cascade screening of relatives, were calculated by decision analy tic models based on real life data. Results: Using the experimental strategy, 4 times more LS patients can be identified among CRC patients as compared to current practice. Both the costs to detect one LS patient (Ã¢ÂÂ¬ 9,437/carrier versus Ã¢ÂÂ¬ 4,855/carrier) and the number needed to test for detecting one LS patient (42 versus 19) dou bled. When including relatives the experimental strategy was found to be highly cost effective because CRC prevention in relatives neutralised the ex tra genetic testing costs, resulting in lower costs ( Ã¢ÂÂ¬ 2180 per extra tested patient) and an average of 9 life years gained. Conclusion: Testing all CRC tumours diagnosed at or below age 70 for LS is cost effective. Implementation is important as relatives from the large number of LS patients that are missed by current practice, can benefit from life saving surveillance.",2014
21766,"The aim of this study was to determine if the at risk SNP alleles for colorectal cancer (CRC), previously identified by GWAS studies, could either alone or in combination contribute to clinical presentations suggestive of an increased genetic risk for CRC. We performed a prospective national case control study based on highly selected patients (CRC in two first degree relatives, one being diagnosed before 61 years; or CRC before 51 years; or multiple primary CRCs, the first before 61 years; exclusion of Lynch syndrome, ade nomatous and hamartomatous polyposes), and appropriate controls corre sponding to healthy volunteers, between 45 and 60 years of age, without personal or familial history of CRC. We included 1029 patients and 350 con trols. We confirmed the association of CRC risk with 4 SNPs, with odds ratio (OR) higher than previously reported : rs16892766 on 8q23.3 (OR: 1.89; p,0.0006); rs4779584 on 15q13.3 (OR: 1.45; p,0.0033), and rs4939827 and rs58920878/Novel 1 on 18q21.1 (OR: 1.49; p,0.0061 and OR: 1.48; p,0,0039).

This study shows that genotyping of a limited number of SNPs, such as 8q23.3 rs16892766 , 15q13.3 rs4779584 and 18q21.1 rs58920878 , should allow to identify subjects at increased risk of CRC who might benefit from early CRC detection.",2014
21767,"Constitutional mismatch repair deficiency (CMMR D) syndrome is a distinct childhood cancer predisposition syndrome that results from biallelic germ line mutations in one of the four MMR genes, MLH1, MSH2 , MSH6 , or PMS2 . The tumour spectrum is very broad, including mainly haematological, brain and intestinal tract tumours. Patients show a variety of non malignant fea tures that are indicative of CMMR D. However, currently no clinical crite ria that should entail diagnostic evaluation of CMMR D exist. The recently established European consortium care for CMMR D (C4CMMRD) proposes a 3 points scoring system for the suspected diagnosis CMMR D in a pediatric/young adult cancer patient. Tumours highly specific for CMMR D syndrome are assigned 3 points, malignancies overrepresented in CMMR D 2 points and all other malignancies 1 point. According to their specificity for CMMR D and their frequency in the general population additional features are weigh ted with 1 2 points. They include multiple hyper and hypopigmented skin areas, brain malformations, pilomatricomas, a second childhood malignancy, a LS associated tumour in a relative and parental consanguinity. According to the scoring system CMMR D should be suspected in any cancer patient who reaches a minimum of 3 points by adding the points of the malignancy and the additional features. We expect that application of the here suggested strategy for CMMR D diagnosis will increase the number of patients being identified at the time when they develop their first tumour. This will allow adjustment of the treatment modalities, offering surveillance strategies for second malignancies and appropriate counselling of the entire family.

RAS/RTK mutations were mutually exclusive with JAK/STAT mutations (p,0.018), driving a combined total of two thirds of analysed ca ses. Clonal architecture analysis shows that both JAK/STAT and RAS/RTK mutations are mostly sub clonal. The study of clonal evolution in the cases with primary leukaemias and relapses shows that JAK STAT mutations are exclusively associated with primary leukaemias and RAS mutations with relapses. This indicates that JAK2 mutated sub clones respond well to con ventional therapy, but then is replaced with RAS mutated sub clones. The dominant clones (including those persisting in primary and relapse leu kaemias) were a combination of mutations in chromatin modifiers (62%), tumour suppressors, lymphocyte differentiation factors, and/or CRLF2 rearrangements. These events were cumulatively present in 93% of cases, with no association with JAK/STAT or RAS/RTK groups. Additionally, novel differences in number and profile of driver events were observed between cALL and preB immunophenotypic subtypes of BCP ALL. Overall our data provide a better molecular understanding of DS ALL and suggests a personalized therapeutic approach to driver mutations, with in dividual mutation profile tailored inclusion of RAS (particularly KRAS) inhi bitors (such as deltarasin) and/or chromatin modifier enzyme inhibitors.

Whole transcriptome and exome sequencing of normal primary bone marrow derived stromal fibroblasts, Epstein Barr Virus (EBV) transformed normal lymphoblasts, a pre therapy primary tu mor derived cell line, and a post chemotherapy metastatic tumor derived cell line, was conducted on an Ion Torrent ProtonÃ¢ÂÂ¢ system to profile the differences in gene expression and in exonic DNA sequence to characterize the molecular changes associated with primary tumorigenesis and disease persistence after treatment. The presence of the EWS/FLI1 fusion gene in the tumor cells was confirmed and the breakpoint determined from both observation of chimeric reads in the RNA seq data and exome sequence ana lysis. Exome datasets indicate apparent loss of heterozygosity genome wide in CHLA10 consistent with cytogenetic analysis that shows tetraploidy in this cell line. Results from RNA seq also indicate numerous instances, geno me wide, of differing transcript isoform expression and exon usage between normal, primary tumor, and metastatic tumor cells suggesting an increasing genomic mutational burden in the evolution of the disease, and pointing in particular toward aberrant regulation of RNA splicing components. Taken together, the combination of RNA seq and exome sequencing on normal cells and primary vs. post chemotherapy tumor is providing a broad and deep view of molecular signatures in tumor progression and indicating that a significant role is played by changes in non coding RNA expression.",2014
21775,"Breast and ovarian cancer predisposition has been associated with a num ber of high , moderate , and low penetrance susceptibility genes. Here we report on the results of high resolution custom array CGH for deletion/du plication analysis and panel based screening of 94 genes associated with hereditary cancer predisposition. Selection criteria for the 100 patients were defined by the German Consorti um for Breast and Ovarian Cancer. NGS was performed on an Illumina MiSeq and target enrichment was done with the Illumina TruSight cancer panel, whereas custom array CGH was performed using Agilent technology. In 28 % of the patients, BRCA1 or BRCA2 variations have been found. These were either clearly pathogenic protein truncating mutations (12 %) or very rare, unclassified missense variations with high probability of effect (16 %). In 39 % of the patients we found rare, unclassified missense variants in low penetrance susceptibility genes, especially NBN and ATM. In one case with early onset of breast cancer and no familial history, a putative splice relevant mutation in TP53 could be identified, which is currently being investigated on cDNA level. 33 % of the patients did not reveal any convincing sequence variation. In 10% of the patients we identified deletions in either BRCA1, CHEK2, or ATM. The extension of mutation screening beyond BRCA1 and BRCA2 reveals disease causing mutations in high penetrance genes, like TP53, as well as mutations in low penetrance susceptibility genes. However, the enormous number of unclassified sequence variants and the detection of carriers for other hereditary diseases pose a huge challenge for genetic counselling.",2014
21776,"Several members of the FANC (Fanconi anaemia complementation group) gene family such as BRCA2 ( FANCD), RAD51C (FANCO), PALB2 (FANCN) and BRIP1 (FANCJ) have been associated with breast cancer (BC) and ovarian cancer (OC) predisposition. Given the fact that most risk families do not carry mutations in established BC/OC genes, we hypothesized that yet unknown disease genes exist. In the course of an exome sequencing project aimed to identify novel BC predisposing genes, we identified a heterozygous nonsense mutation (p. Gln1701Ter) within the FANCM gene in a BRCA1/2 negative pa tient affected by early onset BC (46y). The FANCM protein is a central com ABSTRACTS POSTERS ESHG 2014 | MILAN, ITALY | WWW. ESHG. ORG 249Back to inde x ponent of the Fanconi anaemia core complex and promotes the recruitment of the S phase checkpoint machinery after binding to DNA damage sites. The nonsense mutation removes the ERCC4 like domain (aa1802 1922) of the 2022aa FANCM protein. A subsequent Sequenom based case control study including 1896 independent BRCA1/2 negative BC index cases and 1726 controls revealed a significant association with BC occurrence (9/1896 ca ses vs. 2/1726 controls; p<0.05). The carrier frequency of the p. Gln1701Ter mutation in controls (0.12%) is similar to that identified in the framework of the NHLBI Exome Sequencing Project (5/4300; european ancestry; 0.12%). Taken together, our data provide first evidence for FANCM as a no vel BC predisposing gene (9/1896 cases vs. 7/6026 controls; p,0.00242) at a moderate penetrance level (OR: 4.101; CI95%:1.401 12.199; RR,2.357; CI95%:1.27 3.326). Due to the low frequency of the FANCM p. Gln1701Ter mutation, however, large collaborative studies are required to quantify the RR of FANCM alterations for BC and potentially other cancer entities.",2014
21777,"Background: Women carrying a germline mutation in BRCA1 or BRCA2 (BRCA1/2) have a very high lifetime risk of breast and ovarian cancer. Men carrying the same mutations are facing an increased risk of prostate and breast cancer. Until now, screening for BRCA1/2 mutations required high quality DNA (from blood or other fresh specimens). This has ruled out fa milies in which the relative(s) suffering from breast or ovarian cancer have already died. Several attempts to screen for mutations in archival formalin fixed, paraffin embedded (FFPE) tissue have so far been with limited suc cess. Aim: We present the first clinical data from our newly developed NGS based analysis, screening archival FFPE samples of non tumor tissue for germline mutations in BRCA1/2. Results: In 33 FFPE samples we found 3 pathogenic BRCA1 mutations, 3 pathogenic BRCA2 mutations and 2 variants of unknown significance in BRCA2. In 17 samples coverage was sufficient to disclose a negative result and in 8 samples the coverage was too low, and hence the result was designated inconclusive. The quality of the data varied between samples with a strong negative correlation between age of the tis sue and sequence quality. Conclusions: Mutations in BRCA1/2 can now be sought after in deceased relatives, in families with suspected germline mu tations. For clinical use, mutations found in FFPE samples should always be confirmed in other samples from either the same individual, or from samp les from close relatives.",2014

High throughput sequencing technologies provide new opportunities for personalized treatment approaches as well as for the identification of novel genetic biomarkers in cancer. We analyzed a total of 9 tumor and reference samples of patients with primary and relapsed B lineage ALL by whole exome /transcriptome sequencing and SNP microarrays. The results were combined to obtain a comprehensive overview on the genomic landscape of B lineage ALL. Only few genes were altered recurrently and our data con firms the hypothesis that the interindividual heterogeneity requires highly individualized therapeutic approaches. Besides common and well known ge netic variations like mutations (e.g. in NRAS, JAK, ILR7), CNVs (e.g. a deletion of PAX5) and fusion genes (e.g. BCR:ABL) a novel gene, PYGO2, was identi fied to be altered in three patients. Besides a fusion gene (MEF2D:PYGO2), a mutation and a duplication of PYGO2 were found in different patients. Our data suggest that PYGO2 plays a role in leukomegenesis.",2014
21779,"Introduction : Gastric cancer is a multifactorial disease and results from a combination of environmental factors and genetic alterations. Approximate ly 8 10% of cases are familial. Germline CDH1 mutations explain a small part of these families. In the majority of cases with early onset or familial ga stric cancer the underlying genetic cause remains unknown. Therefore, we aim to find new genetic predisposition genes for gastric cancer. Patients: 41 patients with early onset (<35 years of age at diagnosis) or familial ga stric cancer (two first degree relatives with gastric cancer diagnosed below the age of 50) were included in our study. Results: Exome sequencing was performed on germline DNA of the 41 patients. High quality variants were selected and common variation was excluded from the data set. Next, both truncating variants and missense variants predicted to be damaging to pro tein function were selected. In total, 225 variants were validated by Sanger sequencing (average 5.5 variants per patient, range 1 12 variants): 63 trun cating variants and 162 missense variants in 191 genes. Thirty eight genes were recurrently affected in maximally three patients. Homozygous and compound heterozygous missense variants were identified in 8 and 3 pati ents, respectively. Three truncating and 26 missense variants are in known cancer predisposing genes. Other variants are located in genes previously associated with or functionally linked to gastric cancer. Conclusion: Using exome sequencing we identified several candidate genes for gastric cancer predisposition. Their contribution to gastric cancer predisposition will be investigated by screening larger cohorts of patients with early onset and/or familial gastric cancer.",2014

Germline CDH1 mutations under lie a gastric cancer predisposition syndrome with autosomal dominant in heritance, characterized by early onset diffuse gastric cancer. In the majori ty of cases with early onset or familial gastric cancer the underlying genetic cause remains unknown. We aimed to find new genetic predisposition genes for gastric cancer. Patient: A 23 year old female patient with diffuse type gastric cancer and without a germline CDH1 mutation also suffered from recurrent fungal infections. Family history revealed a consanguineous rela tion of her parents. There were no other cases of gastric cancer in the family. Results: Whole exome sequencing of the patientsÃ¢ÂÂ germline DNA identified a homozygous missense variant (c.712C>T , p. Arg238Cys) in the gene en coding MYD88, which plays a central role in the immune response against H.pylori infections. Immunological assays on peripheral blood mononuclear cells revealed normal immune responses to Staphylococcus aureus, but im paired immune responses upon stimulation with H.pylori and Candida al bicans, characterized by a specific defect in production of Th17 cytokines IL 17 and IL 22. This was due to defective IL1 beta responses, a crucial cy tokine for Th17 development. Conclusion: Impaired Th17 mucosal host de fense against H.pylori, which is associated with gastric cancer development, was observed in a patient with early onset gastric cancer and a homozygous MYD88 variant. These defective Th17 responses were also likely the cause of fungal infections. Our data suggest that genetic defects leading to defective anti Helicobacter innate pattern recognition predispose to gastric cancer.",2014

Here, we evaluated whether the PHB ABSTRACTS POSTERS ESHG 2014 | MILAN, ITALY | WWW. ESHG. ORG 250Back to inde x copy number and the rs6917 polymorphism affect its expression in gastric cancer. Forty eight pairs of gastric cancers and corresponding non neopla stic gastric samples were evaluated. PHB expression was analyzed by real ti me quantitative PCR and by immunohistochemistry. Gene copy number was investigated by quantitative PCR. Allele specific expression was determined by sequencing and by TaqMan assay. Down regulation and up regulation of PHB was observed in the tumors (45.5% and 20.5%, respectively). Reduced PHB expression was associated with dedifferentiation (P,0.029), lower in vasion (P,0.002), absence of lymph node metastasis (P,0.040) and early gastric cancer (P,0.002). In all cases, the PHB immunoreactivity was de tected in neoplastic and non neoplastic cells. PHB was mainly expressed in the cytoplasm. PHB amplification was observed in 34.2% tumors. PHB gain was associated with higher gene expression (P,0.003) and late onset ga stric cancer (P,0.022). In our sample, 22% patients were heterozygous and 4.17% were homozygous for the minor allele in the rs6917 polymorphism. The presence of the T allele in this polymorphism was associated with re duced expression in GC (P<0.001) and in non neoplastic samples (P<0.001). Only one patient presented a higher C/T ratio in both tumor and non neo plastic samples. In most cases, lower C/T ratio was detected. Thus, PHB copy number variation and differential expression of the rs6917 polymorphism may have a role in PHB transcriptional regulation.",2014
21782,"Alteration of the number of copies of Double Minutes (DMs) with oncogenic EGFR mutations in response to tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) is a novel adaptive mechanism of glioblastoma. In this study we provide evidence that such mutations in DMs, called here Amplification Linked Extrachromoso mal Mutations (ALEMs), originate extrachromosomally and could therefore be completely eliminated from the cancer cells. By exome sequencing of 7 glioblastoma patients we revealed ALEMs in EGFR, PDGFRA and other ge nes. These mutations together with DMs were lost by cancer cells in derived gliomaspheres. We confirmed the extrachromosomal origin of such muta tions by showing that wild type and mutated DMs may coexist in the same tumor. Analysis of 4198 tumors from TCGA collection suggested the pres ence of ALEMs across different tumor types with the highest prevalence in glioblastomas and Low Grade Gliomas. In these tumors, driver oncogenic mutations in DMs were 13 25 fold more frequent as compared to the dis tribution of passenger mutations confirming the effective expansion of ex trachromosomal drivers. The extrachromosomal nature of ALEMs provides a powerful mechanism of rapid regulation of the copy number of mutated oncogenes including their massive increase or complete loss in response to extracellular stimuli such as RTK inhibitors or growth factors.",2014

Hertzen Moscow Research Institute of Oncology, Moscow, Russian Federation. Despite recent advances in the diagnosis and treatment of glioblastoma, the prognosis for patients with this highly malignant tumor remains poor. Research of glioblastoma at the molecular genetic level can help reveal changes underlying this tumor, identify potential markers of prognosis of the disease and response to therapy. An efficient approach of identifying candidate genes, the disturbance of structure and functioning of which may be associated with the development of cancer, is the analysis of LOH. We have assessed 7 genomic loci for which LOH in glioblastoma have not been previously reported: 2q31.2, 3p25.1, 5q14.3, 7q21.2, 12q21.33, 18q11.2 and 21q21.1. None of these loci is associated with glioblastoma susceptibility according to OMIM. The selected loci were examined by microsatellite ana lysis in 86 glioblastoma samples. Four of the seven loci, 2q31.2, 12q21.33, 18q11.2 and 21q21.1 revealed no LOH cases. However, LOH was identified at 3p25.1, 5q14.3 and 7q21.2 with a frequency of 25.8% (8/31), 20.0% (3/15) and 30.3% (10/33), respectively. Identified areas of LOH can contain potential candidate genes that may be of interest in terms of the molecu lar pathology of glioblastoma. Some of these genes are SLC6A6 (3p25.1), CCNH (5q14.3), AKAP9 (7q21.2). Thus, we have identified new loci of LOH in glioblastoma, in which candidate genes that play a role in tumor develop ment and represent potential molecular genetic markers may be located. We have also confirmed LOH at 8q21.3 and 14q13.3 with a frequency of 17.9% (5/28) and 60.0% (9/15), respectively, which other authors have reported.",2014
21784,"Background. Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most lethal malignant human brain tumor with the poor survival prognosis exceeding to 12 15 months after diagnosis. No reliable molecular marker has been verified for GBM diagnostics up to date. Therefore, extensive research in molecu lar changes of GMB is essential to better understand this pathology. NDRG2 gene has been reported to be downregulated in GBM, whereas overexpres sion of this gene represses glioblastoma cell proliferation in vitro. To further address the role of NDRG2 in gliomagenesis, we analyzed NDRG2 expres sion at mRNA and protein level in gliomas of different malignancy grade. Material and Methods. The study included 78 different malignancy glioma tumors (9 astrocytomas grade I, 29 grade II, 14 grade III and 26 gliobla stomas). NDRG2 mRNA expression study was performed using quantitative real time Reverse Transcription PCR analysis, while protein expression was estimated by using Western blot technique. Results. We found a strong de crease of NDRG2 mRNA expression in glioblastoma to about 10 fold compa red to I III grade gliomas (Kruskal Wallis, p<0.0001). In line with the mRNA data, NDRG2 protein level was markedly reduced in glioblastomas (to about 3 4 fold) as compared to grade I III gliomas (p<0.0001). Spearman correla tion analysis demonstrated significant correlation of NDRG2 transcripts and protein expression levels (r,0.662, p<0.0001). Survival analysis showed ne gative correlation between NDRG2 expression and tumor progression (Log rank p,0.0001). Our results highlight the importance of NDRG2 for glioma tumorigenesis as well as being as an indicatory factor for glioma malignancy and patient survival.",2014

Here we compared genomic profiles of 27 pairs of primary and recurrent IDH1/2 wild type glioblastomas by genome wide array based comparative genomic hybri dization. By bioinformatic analysis, primary and recurrent tumor profiles were normalized and segmented, chromosomal gains and losses called ta king the tumor cell content into account, and difference profiles deduced. Seven of 27 (26%) pairs lacked DNA copy number differences between primary and recurrent tumors (Equal pairs). The recurrent tumors in 9/27 (33%) pairs contained all chromosomal imbalances of the primary tumors plus additional ones, suggesting that a major subclone sequentially accu mulated aberrations (Sequential pairs). In 11/27 (41%) pairs, the profiles of primary and recurrent tumors were divergent, i.e. the recurrent tumors contained additional aberrations but had lost others, suggesting a polyclo nal composition of the primary tumors and considerable clonal evolution (Discrepant pairs). Losses on 9p21.3 harboring the CDKN2A/B locus were significantly more common in primary tumors from non Equal pairs. Non Equal pairs showed ten regions of recurrent genomic differences between primary and recurrent tumors harboring 46 candidate genes associated with tumor recurrence. In particular, copy numbers of genes encoding apo ptosis regulators were frequently changed upon recurrence. In summary, approximately 25% of IDH1/2 wild type glioblastoma pairs have stable genomic imbalances. In contrast, approximately 75% of IDH1/2 wild type glioblastomas undergo further genomic aberrations and alter their clonal composition upon recurrence impacting their genomic profile, a process possibly facilitated by loss on 9p21.3 in the primary tumor.

21786,"Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM; WHO grade IV), the most frequent prima ry malignant brain tumor in adults, accounts for approximately 7 9% of all central nervous (CNS) tumors in childhood. Adult and paediatric GBMs (pGBMs) have distinct genetic and molecular pathways of tumorigenesis and different studies, based on array CGH analysis, reported that there are signi ficant differences in Copy Number Alterations (CNA). In our previous study we identified, using array CGH, recurrent CNA in 8 pGBMs establishing mi nimum common regions (MCR) of duplication/amplification and deletion. Based on these results, we developed a next generation sequencing (NGS) approach to screen the genetic profile of tumors. NGS has provided a new paradigm in biomedical research to delineate the genetic basis of human di seases. The panel was designed to cover 420 genes selected within of MCRs to try to identify new genes involved in tumorigenesis and/or progression of pGBMs. In 8 patients we found 18 heterozygous mutations in different ge nes. The same mutations were also found in DNA extracted from blood and in two cases we demonstrated the parental origin of 12 mutations. Given the rarity of the disease and the scarcity of data in the literature, our findings may better elucidate if there is a genomic background in development and progression of pGBM.

21787,"Background: Gliomas are the most malignant and common primary brain tumors, classified upon malignancy grade and histological characteristics. Correct diagnosis that relies solely on histopathological characteristics might be difficult and inadequate, particularly in cases that lack typical fea tures. Glioma subtypes have distinct molecular features and gene expression analyses could uncover molecular biomarkers for deciphering glioma subty pes. Our purpose was to identify lncRNAs that might play role in gliomage nesis and investigate potential association of differential expression profiles with different glioma subtypes. Patients and methods: Sixty four patients were included in the study. We used quantitative real time PCR (qPCR) in order to determine differentially expressed lncRNAs using LncRNA array profiler on a smaller cohort of pathohistologically evaluated glioma samp les normalized to human brain reference RNA. A subset of differential ln cRNAs was further validated by qPCR approach on a biger cohort of glioma samples and statistically evaluated using Mann Whitney and Kruskal Wallis tests. Results: LncRNA profiling revealed a total of 74 among 90 analysed lncRNAs to be widely expressed and statistical tests identified a subset of 10 significantly differentially expressed lncRNAs. Further analyses of 7 dys regulated lncRNAs (7SL , EGOA, HOTAIR , JPX, MEG3, RNCR3 and ZNFX1 AS1 ) have showed statistically significant differences in relative gene expression ratios implicating distinctive expression profiles in glioma subtypes. Con clusions: Our findings support the concept of lncRNAs as molecular bio markers by determining distinctive subtype related lncRNA expression pat terns between glioma subtypes, which suggest an important role of lncRNAs in glioma biogenesis and implicate the potential use of lncRNAs in glioma histological classification.",2014
21788,"Recent genome wide studies have been developed to support hystologic classification of gliomas and different molecular abnormalities have been linked to tumor grading and disease progression. In our study we investigated MGMT promoter methylation, 10q loss of hete rozygosity (LOH) and IDH1 R132H mutation in tumor specimens from 103 patients with glioblastoma and II and III grade gliomas, to further under stand: 1) correlation with grading, 2) prognostic value. Pyrosequencing analysis of MGMT promoter showed that methylation le vels decrease from low to high grade tumors (p <0,001), confirming that hypermethylation (methylation levels >20%) correlates with a better pro gression free survival (PFS). Interestingly, a mildly methylated subgroup (methylation 20% 40%) revealed a better PFS. Microsatellite and a CGH analyses showed that 10q LOH is common in high grade tumors and asso ciates with MGMT hypomethylation, while absence of LOH and hyperme thylation correlate with low grade tumors. IDH1 mutation was investigated by pyrosequencing and detected in all of low grade gliomas (10 cases), in 7/11 II grade gliomas. We did not find mutations in IV grade gliomas, indica ting a strong association between tumor grading and IDH1 mutation status (p<0,001). In addition, we found a correlation between IDH1 mutation and MGMT methylation level (p<0,001), both decreasing with increasing tumor grade. In conclusion, our data reinforced the role of MGMT methylation and IDH1 mutation as hallmarks of better prognosis, and conversely 10q LOH as a poorer one. Moreover, we evidenced the existence of a mildly methylated glioma subtype correlated with a better PFS.",2014

In total, 5,027 13,961 and 5,275 12,624 somatic single nucleotide variants (SNVs) were detected in primary HCC and lung metastases, respectively. Generally, 38.88 78.49% of SNVs detected inmetastases were present in primary tu mors. We identified 65 221 structural variations (SVs) in primary tumors and 60 232 SVs in metastases. Comparison of these SVs shows very simi lar and largely overlapped mutated segmentsbetween primary and meta static tumors. Copy number alterations between primary and metastatic pairs were also found to be closely related.

HDGC is relatively uncommon, repre senting about 2% of gastric cancer. The majority of inactivating mutations in HDGC families are of the truncating type (75%), whereas the remaining are missense type. The estimated lifetime risk for DGC is more than 80% in mutation carriers and prophylactic total gastrectomy is recommended. Sub jects and methods: A 47 year old female patient diagnosed with DGC was screened for CDH1 gene mutations. DNA and RNA extraction was carried out from blood and tissue (gastric biopsy) and the entire coding sequence and flanking intronic portions of the CDH1 were sequenced. Other family relatives (three sisters, an uncle and a nephew) were also screened. Results: A deletion in exon 9 of CDH1 gene (c.1220delC, p.407*), not previously de scribed, has been found. This mutation generates a stop codon that leads to a pathogenic variant. The presence of the mutation was corroborated both, at DNA and RNA level in blood and tissue. The proband died during the stu dy. One of the sisters presented also the deletion and had a previous history of malignant colorectal polyp at the age of 49. Her son (nephew of the pro band) presented also the mutation. Neither of the other relatives harboured the mutation. Conclusion: HDCG has a poorly prognosis, mainly because of its difficult early detection.

FOCAD was deleted in around 50% of primary glioblastomas, and its gene product, focadhesin, had an impact on glioblastoma growth in vivo and cell motility in vitro. The aim of this pro ject was to further characterize focadhesin by targeting its unknown bin ding partners. Therefore, we performed two independent yeast two hybrid screens using a human brain cDNA library. In total, we isolated 206 clones, from which we eliminated 155 clones, because they could grow without au xotrophic marker expression. The DNA sequences of the remaining 51 prey inserts were identified. In 26 prey plasmids, the cDNAs were protein coding and in frame. Finally, 8 distinct potential binding partners were identified, which can be categorized into the functional groups of calcium signaling, mi tosis, protein folding, RNA processing and cell metabolism. To confirm these interactions, we performed retransformation experiments using fresh yeast. Three candidates were also analyzed by pull down assays and co localiza tion studies using human cells. Two interactions have been confirmed so far.

Since compound mutations might confer cross resistance to multiple TKIs, the information provided by our assay can directly influence the choice of therapy. In another project we study MLL rearranged leukemias, characterized by chromosomal translocations involving the MLL gene at 11q23. MLL can form fusions transcripts together with several different genes, some of which are still unknown. In some cases conventional assays like G banding and FISH fail to detect these fusion partners. We are therefore evaluating a hybridi zation based assay for targeted capture of MLL cDNA, in combination with Ion Torrent sequencing. Our preliminary results indicate that our method increases the sensitivity for detecting MLL fusion genes by several orders of magnitude compared to a regular RNA sequencing approach.",2014
21795,"The Li Fraumeni syndrome (LFS), due to germline TP53 mutations, repre sents a remarkable cancer predisposition characterized by the extent of tu mour spectrum. For 20 years, analysis of over 1700 families allowed us to identify 214 French families with TP53 mutation, thanks to the ChompretÃ¢ÂÂs criteria gradually elaborated by the French LFS working group. Updated data from 322 LFS patients with 552 tumours revealed that the median age of first tumour onset was 27 years, that the most frequent tumours were breast cancers (167), soft tissue sarcomas (103), osteo/chondro sarcomas (58), brain tumours (43) and adrenocortical carcinomas (42), and that 43% of patients developed multiple primary tumours. Germline TP53 mutations were detected in 50% of children with adrenocortical carcinoma, choroid plexus carcinoma, or rhabdomyosarcoma. Sixty four percent of TP53 altera tions were missense mutations and 4% genomic rearrangements. We found that TP53 mutation carriers harbouring the MDM2 285 309GG haplotype developed tumours 5 years earlier than others. The most striking observati on was that patients with dominant negative missense mutation developed first tumour earlier (22 y) than patients with null mutation (42 y). Twenty ABSTRACTS POSTERS ESHG 2014 | MILAN, ITALY | WWW. ESHG. ORG 253Back to inde x years after the identification of LFS molecular basis, this report reveals that 2 forms of LFS probably exist: an aggressive, characterized by early onset tu mours, due to highly penetrant dominant negative missense mutations, and a moderate, characterized by later age of onset, due to mutations with lower penetrance. The remarkable high incidence of multiple primary tumours is probably explained by genotoxic effects of chemo and radio therapy and the key role of p53 response to DNA damage.",2014
21796,"Background: Metastatic dissemination is the most frequent cause of death in sporadic colorectal cancer (sCRC). The metastatic process is considered, at least in part, to be related to a specific background of genetic alterations accumulated in cells from primary tumors, the identification of such gene tic alterations being critical for the identification of sCRC patients at risk of developing metastases. Methods: In this study we used high resolution 500K SNP arrays for the identification of copy number alteration profiles present at diagnosis in pri mary tumors from metastatic (n,23) versus non metastatic (n,26) sCRC. Results: Our results showed a characteristic pattern of copy number altera tions among metastatic sCRC which involved losses of 23 regions at chromo somes 1p, 17p and 18q, together with gains of 35 regions at chromosomes 7 and 13q. Conclusion: As could be expected, such copy number profile involved multip le genes previously associated with sCRC (i.e. SMAD2) and/or the metastatic process (i.e. PODXL) and it was further associated with a poorer outcome.",2014
21797,"Despite the great bulk of research to identify genetic susceptibility genes in lung cancer by genome wide association studies, only three loci have been identified and replicated consistently in subsequent studies. In addition to confer a very low risk, they have been associated with lung cancer in smo kers, but not in non smokers. The polygenic nature of common cancers has frequently been suggested, but its biological basis still remains elusive. We tested the hypothesis that genetic susceptibility may rely on germ line mu tations of a restricted number of genes. A combination between an advanced technical tool, i.e. the exome sequencing, and a new patient selection stra tegy was used. Among 964 lung adenocarcinoma patients we selected two patients with very early onset disease (mean age 43) in absence of cigarette smoking, and having a first degree healthy sibling available for genome com parison older than at least 7 years. Germ line truncating mutations were detected in 8 and 5 different cancer predisposing genes in each affected sub ject, respectively, but not in the healthy sib (p,0.0026). Some of them are well known cancer players in lung tumors and others are genes previously identified in other cancer tissues. This study demonstrated for the first time that never smoker patients with lung adenocarcinoma carry a specific and private oligogenic combination of germ line mutations in cancer predispo sing genes. Exome sequencing of another pair of sibs with slightly later age onset is ongoing. These findings, if replicated with further studies, support the hypothesis of an oligogenic nature of early onset common cancers.",2014
21798,"It is becoming evident that Lynch Syndrome (LS) is one of the most common cancer syndromes. Diagnosis is not always trivial and may be costly. Know ledge of incidence, spectrum of mutations and genes involved in specific po pulations, facilitates the diagnostic process and contributes to clinical work up. AIM: To report a cohort of LS families in the Israeli population, gene distribution, mutations detected and co occurrence of related syndromes. METHODS: Patients were studied at high risk clinics. Diagnostics followed a multi step process. It included testing for founder mutations, tumor testing, gene sequencing and MLPA. LS was defined by positive tumor analysis and/ or positive mutation testing. RESULTS: We describe a cohort of 318 carri ers from 169 families with LS. We have identified 61 different mutations in 102 families; 3 founder mutations occurred in over 70% of Ashkenazi LS families, where mutations in MSH6 were more common than in MLH1. We identified founder mutations also among Jewish families from Georgia, Iran and Afghanistan. MSH2 was mutated in 62% of the cases, one third of these mutations were large deletions. Constitutional mismatch repair deficiency (C MMRD) was identified in 6 families. CONCLUSIONS: Mutation spectrum and gene distribution in the Israeli population is unique. Mutations in MSH2 and MSH6 cause the majority of cases. Six founder mutations contribute to LS in 4 different ethnic sub groups. C MMRD occurs either due to founder mutations or consanguinity. These features affect the phenotype, the dia gnostic process, risk estimation, and genetic counseling.",2014
21799,"Introduction Mutations in the PMS2 gene are responsible for Lynch syn drome, a genetically inherited disorder with an increased risk of foremost colorectal cancer (CRC) and endometrial cancer (EC). Possibly, the reported variability in cancer prevalence and age of diagnosis between patients and families can partly be explained by genotype and/or parent of origin effects (POE). Methods The genotypes and clinical data of 383 European PMS2 mu tation carriers were available for analysis. Mutations with loss of RNA ex pression (group 1) and retained RNA expression (group 2) were compared. A one way Anova test and Cox regression were done to compare mean age of cancer diagnosis and calculate hazard ratios (HR). Results Mean age of CRC diagnosis was 50,99 years (CI 48,09 53,89) for group 1 and 60,00 years (CI 52,50 67,50) for group 2 (p,0,032). For EC no significant differences in mean age of diagnosis were found. Cox regression showed slightly higher non significant HRs for both CRC (HR: 1,274, p,0,440) and EC (HR:1,216, p,0,722) when comparing group1 to group 2. No significant HR for CRC or EC depending on whether the mutation was inherited from father or mother was found. Discussion A higher mean age at CRC diagnosis and a non signi ficant higher CRC risk in the group with loss of RNA expression was identi fied. No significant evidence of a POE was found. Larger studies are needed to confirm findings. Possible information on genotype and other modifying risk factors might lead to individual risk stratification and surveillance pro grams in the future.",2014
21800,"ABSTRACTS POSTERS ESHG 2014 | MILAN, ITALY | WWW. ESHG. ORG 254Back to inde x Multiple primary tumors of the gastrointestinal tract, uterus, ovaries, cen tral nervous system and other organs are hallmarks of Lynch syndrome, caused by heterozygous germline mutations in the mismatch repair (MMR) genes MLH1, MSH2, MSH6 and PMS2. Bi allelic mutations of the same genes have been associated with a rare childhood cancer syndrome characterized by hematological malignancies, sarcomas, brain and gastrointestinal tumors together with cafÃÂ¨ au lait spots resembling Neurofibromatosis 1. Here we report on a female patient who developed multiple primary tumors between 21 and 27 years of age including two metachronous colorectal cancers, a fillodes tumour of the breast, a glioblastoma and a clear cell carcinoma of the ovaries. Genetic testing identified two germline heterozygote MSH6 mutations: a frameshift mutation (c.1610_1613delAGTA) inherited from the father and a suspected deleterious missense mutation (p. Arg1076His) inherited from the mother. No TP53, MLH1 or MSH2 mutations were found. Microsatellite analysis revealed instability of BAT26 and BAT40 in both the colon and the ovarian carcinomas. The MLH1, MSH2 and PMS2 proteins sho wed nuclear staining in all specimens while MSH6 was completely absent in tumor and normal cells, including the fillodes tumor of the breast and the normal mucosa of the colon. Germline mutations in the MMR genes, either mono allelic or bi allelic, can therefore underlie a wide spectrum of cancer syndromes characterized by variable age at onset and severity of the cancer risk. Development of multiple primary tumors in young adults appears to be suggestive for the presence of bi allelic mutations of the MMR genes.",2014
21801,"A few Lynch Syndrome patients display constitutional epimutations of the mismatch repair genes. Two models of MLH1 epimutations have been hy pothesized: the Ã¢ÂÂprimaryÃ¢ÂÂ type arises spontaneously and is reversible bet ween generations; the Ã¢ÂÂsecondaryÃ¢ÂÂ type is caused by an unknown cis acting genetic based alteration, with a classical Mendelian autosomal dominant inheritance pattern. We report here a case with a heritable large genomic deletion of MLH1 as sociated with constitutional promoter methylation of the same gene. Both aberrations were found by MLPA analyses in a patient with colorectal and endometrial cancers (30 and 40 years), displaying MSI H and loss of the MLH1 protein. They were also detected in three other affected relatives and in tumors. We have explored the link between MLH1 deletion and methylation by diffe rent molecular approaches. The deletion of 997bp included the ATG codon, exon 1 and part of intron 1. Bisulfite sequencing demonstrated that CpG methylation was present on the deleted allele and involved both flanking sequences. As expected, a lymphoblastoid cell line obtained from the pro band expressed about half of the MLH1 transcript levels, suggesting that the mutated/methylated allele was completely silenced. Treatments with the demethylating agent 5 AzaC was not able to revert the methylation status of the CpG analyzed and had only a little impact on MLH1 expression. In conclusion, in this family with a classical autosomal dominant pattern, we have obtained evidences that MLH1 hypermethylation is not an indepen dent event, but it is induced by a so far unknown mechanism related to the presence of the concurrent deletion.",2014
21802,"Significant phenotypic similarities among Lynch syndrome (LS) and MU TYH associated polyposis (MAP) has been reported. We describe a family suspicious of having LS. A 69 years old female dia gnosed of an endometrial cancer (T1N0M0) and right CRC (T3N0M0) with multiple polyps at ages 60 and 65, respectively. Endometrial tumor had loss of MLH1 and PMS2 expression, MSI, no BRAF_V600E mutation, absence of MLH1 methylation, and KRAS_G12C mutation. No pathogenic variant was found in the MLH1 mutation screening and MAP suspicion was considered. MUTYH testing was approached by Sanger sequencing screening of recur rent variants at exons 7 and 13. Patient did show homozygous pattern for c.1187G>A (p. G396D) variant and was diagnosed as MAP syndrome. Pre dictive test for relatives unveiled an unexpected finding, we found one of her sons with an apparent wild type sequence. Further analysis evidenced a large deletion comprising exon 4 16 in both mother and son. Breakpoint characterization of this deletion allowed us to precisely define this alterati on as c.348+33_*64+146del4285insTA with a precise size deletion of 4,285 kb. The same deletion has been published in other two unrelated families from French and Portuguese origin suggesting a founder effect. Large rear rangements at MUTYH locus are rare although probably under diagnosed. Based on these findings we recommend first, to include MUTYH gene in the testing strategy for LS and second, to test for MUTYH large rearrangements in heterozygous cases after whole gene sequencing, as well as in apparent homozygous cases.",2014

Background: In male breast cancer (MBC) the prevalence of BRCA1/2 mu tations varies considerably between countries. In the Netherlands data were collected of all MBC patients diagnosed in the last 20 years. The nationally agreed criteria for DNA testing are rather broad, implying that many MBC cases with or without a family history for breast cancer have been tested. Aim of this study is to get more insight in the percentage of BRCA1/2 muta tions among an unselected cohort of MBC patients. Methods: All diagnosed MBC patients between 1989 2009 (n,1487) were linked to databases of all clinical genetic centers. Data of BRCA testing, family history and tumor characteristics were collected. Results: 334 (22%) of MBC patients were tested for BRCA1/2. Ten (3%) BRCA1, 51 (15%) BRCA2 mutations were identified and also 7 (2%) variants of uncertain significance (VUS). At least one first or second degree relative with breast cancer <50 yr was seen in 80% of BRCA1, 20% of BRCA2 and 6% of non BRCA1/2 MBC patients. Pre liminary studies did show that the majority (86%) of BRCA associated MBC were ductal carcinomas of no special type. Conclusion: Roughly one fifth of unselected MBC patients had undergone DNA testing, in 18% of these a BRCA mutation was found. Most striking family histories were seen in BR CA1 families, whereas the majority of BRCA2 MBC patients had no strong family history. Based on our results and previous studies genetic testing for BRCA1/2 should be recommended for any MBC case, regardless of family history for breast cancer.",2014
21804,"MAP/microtubule affinity regulating kinase 4 (MARK4) is a serine threonine kinase that phosphorylates and regulates MAP proteins. MARK4 differs from the other members of the MARK protein family, for encoding two isoforms (MARK4L and MARK4S) differentially expressed in the nervous system, and for the peculiar sub cellular localisation at the centrosome and the midbody. In order to better define the role of MARK4 in cell cycle and cytoskeleton dynamics, we performed cytofluorimetric analysis of fibroblasts and glioma cells, showing that MARK4 is expressed throughout the cell cycle and is preferentially activated during mitosis and cytokinesis. Using the same cell system we demonstrated the role of MARK4 in cell cycle progression and cytoskeleton regulation by knockdown and overexpression experiments. Upon MARK4S silencing, fibroblasts and glioma cells display altered mor phology, matched with a reduction in proliferation rate and mitotic fraction. In addition, silenced cells show duplicated centrosomes positioned apically to the nucleus, a feature typical of the G1/S phase transition. Overexpression of MARK4L or MARK4S reduced the density of the microtubule network, confirming microtubules as the main target of MARK4. Furthermore in fi broblasts MARK4L was found to colocalise with vimentin and to reorganise ABSTRACTS POSTERS ESHG 2014 | MILAN, ITALY | WWW. ESHG. ORG 255Back to inde x intermediate filaments. Overexpression of kinase dead mutants indicated that the effects on both cytoskeleton compartments are due to MARK4 ki nase activity.

21805,"The prevalence of mutations in the CDKN2A melanoma candidate gene correlates with number of affected family members and number of MPM/neoplastic events. International referral guidelines for genetic counselling and testing (GenoMEL) indicate that in low melanoma incidence populati ons individuals developing two melanomas may be candidate for conside ration for genetic testing, even in the absence of family history (FH). Aims of this multicenter case control study performed within the Italian Melano ma Intergroup were to verify the likelihood to identify mutations carriers in MPM vs single primary melanoma (SPM) patients recruited, to update the current Italian shared protocol for hereditary melanoma (SIGU ONC re commendations, Bianchi et al, 2004) and to include the presence of MPM, in the absence of family history, as a criterion. Despite regional differences (i.e. founder mutations), 118/587 (20,1%) of the recruited MPM patients (including those with melanoma FH) and 52/443 (11,7% ) of sporadic MPM harbored CDKN2A mutations, suggesting that the development of MPM (2 or more events) even in the absence of FH can be considered a criterion for genetic testing on national basis. The presence of MPM cases in a family was confirmed as a strong mutation predictive parameter, while CDKN2A muta tions in sporadic SPM was under 5%. The search for the MITF E318K muta tion, recently identified as a novel intermediate risk allele, showed that the mutation was associated with the risk of sporadic MPM (3,7% of sporadic MPM compared to 0.8% of SPM), underscoring the importance of the MITF mutation to the burden of MPM susceptibility.",2014
21806,"Interleukins play a critical role in immune regulation of tumor development. Because melanoma is a highly immunogenic cancer, and its progression of ten correlates with immune related factors, in this study we have tested wh ether inherited genetic variants in interleukin pathways affect the clinical outcomes of melanoma patients. We performed a two stage association ana lysis of 94 SNPs tagging 32 interleukin genes in 1,200 melanoma patients, ascertained at the New York University Medical Center between 2001 2013. The two stages (discovery and validation) were matched by tumor characte ristics, age, and gender. Multivariate Cox regression models tested the asso ciations with recurrence free and overall survival (RFS and OS, respective ly), including age, gender, stage, thickness, ulceration status, anatomic site, and histological subtypes as covariates. A region within 1q32.1 containing IL10, IL19, IL20, IL24 was significantly associated with melanoma OS. Speci fically, two SNPs in IL10 (rs3024493 and rs2222202) showed the strongest associations with OS (HR,5.82, 95% CI,2.08 16.3, p,0.0009; HR,0.47, 95% CI,0.28 0.80, p,0.006 respectively). The association between rs3024493 and OS replicated among both stages (stage 1 p,0.028, stage 2 p,0.017). This study has identified novel associations of germline genetic risk variants in an interleukin locus at 1q32.1 with melanoma outcomes (rs3024493), and validated the associations from previous smaller studies that showed germline variants in IL10 (rs2222202) associate with worse OS. Pending multi institutional meta analysis and further genetic and functional investi gations, this study strongly suggests that germline variants in the interleu kin locus at 1q32.1 should be considered as novel prognostic markers with potential clinical utility.",2014
21807,"BACKGROUND: Ipilimumab based immunotherapy has substantially in creased survival for patients with advanced melanoma, however, the benefit is observed only in a small portion of treated patients. It is highly plausible, yet completely unexplored, that germline genetic factors modulate immu notherapy outcome. In this study we performed whole exome sequencing (WES) to discover novel germline determinants of response to ipilimumab. METHODS: Blood samples were collected from >60 metastatic melanoma patients treated with ipilimumab at the New York University Cancer Cen ter. WES was performed on objective responders (OR) and non responders (NR), defined by immune related response criteria, using the Nextera plat form (Illumina) at average 30x coverage. A novel method for testing the as sociation between OR and NR by variant, gene and enrichment of molecular networks was implemented. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis and Pathway Studio were used to test the pathway associations. RESULTS: The prelimi nary data comparing an initial subset of 30 ORs and 30 NRs identified si gnificant associations with ipilimumab response for several loci including RPS6KB1 (p,0.001) and LNX2 (0.001). In addition, the pathway analysis showed significant associations for SMAD 3 (p,0.04) and interleukin 1 (p,0.04) related pathways. CONCLUSION: Preliminary findings provide pro mising evidence supporting the presence of germline genetic factors asso ciated with response to ipilimumab therapy. The data suggest in part a role for immune related pathways. As we continue to accrue patients, we antici pate an increase in the analytical power of the discovery phase and also an expanded validation of the current findings, suggesting for the first time that germline genetic factors modulate immunotherapy response.",2014
21808,"MicroRNAs are crucial post transcriptional gene regulators whose strong sequence conservation leads to predict that nucleotide changes in these molecules may be related to disease. We analyzed human microRNA genetic variation and its possible involvement in cancer through a functional ap proach. From 284 common SNPs (MAF>0.05) located in 254 out of 1872 microRNAs (miRBase Release20.0), 191 were in the precursor microR NA (2.0 SNP/kb), 58 in the mature microRNA (1.5 SNP/kb) and 35 in the microRNA seed region (1.8 SNP/kb). Five of these SNPs, which were pre viously associated with cancer, were selected for further studies. Three of them (rs12416605, rs35770269 and rs2910164) were in the seed region of miR 938, miR 449c and miR 146a, respectively; one (rs11614913) in the mature miR 196a 2 and the last one (rs3746444) in the mature miR 499b and seed region of miR 499a. Target gene predictions using TargetScan for these microRNA variants revealed that major alleles had a larger number of predicted target genes than minor ones and very little overlap was observed between both alleles in all cases. Furthermore, morphological differences in HeLa cells were observed between the rs3746444 A and G alleles (miR 499a seed) after transfection experiments. Also different expression levels bet ween the C and T rs11614913 alleles (mature miR 196a 2) were detected by RT qPCR. We are currently investigating the effect of these variants in the spectrum of genes regulated by the studied microRNAs through transcripto me and functional experiments. Different alleles of common microRNA SNPs associated with cancer could lead to changes in microRNA expression and affect their gene regulatory networks.",2014

The expression of let 7a was significantly decreased in tu mors comparing to adjacent tissue at both 2 and 5 cm. Let 7a and miR 155 levels in tumor were substantially lower than in adjacent tissue in patients under 63 years. The expression of let 7a and miR 155 in tumor was also suppressed in patients with III IV stages of NSCLC.

21810,"We report on a female patient diagnosed with breast, colon, and endometri al cancer at the age of 38, 40, and 41 respectively, presenting with cafÃÂ© au lait macules, multiple neurofibromas and axillary freckling. With respect to the family history, her paternal grandmother died at the age of 63 for a colon cancer diagnosed when she was 35, whereas her father died at the age of 42 because of an accident. As the proband met the criteria for Neurofibromatosis 1 (NF1), analysis of the NF1 gene was performed. A frameshift mutation (c.7096_7101delAACTTT) was identified confirming the clinical diagnosis. The parents showed no clinical signs of NF1 nor did the two probandÃ¢ÂÂs sib lings, which tested negative. Because of the co occurrence of endometrial and colon cancer in our pati ent, and the presence of an early onset colon cancer in the paternal grand mother, expression of mismatch repair protein and Microsatellite Instability (MSI) were analyzed on endometrial and colon cancers. Both tissue showed loss of staining for the MSH2 MSH6 heterodimer and high MSI, therefore analysis of MSH2 was performed, leading to the identi fication of a nonsense mutation of exon 2 (c.289C>T , p. Gln97*), consistent with the presence of the Lynch syndrome. As women with NF1 have a fivefold risk of developing premenopausal bre ast cancer, no further analysis was performed.

21811,"Orsola Malpighi, Bologna, Italy. Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) mutations may contribute to tumor initiation and progression. mtDNA mutations have never been considered as causati ve or secondary events for neuroblastoma progression. We sequenced 36 full length mitochondrial genomes belonging to 16 low risk (LR) and 20 high risk (HR) Italian neuroblastomas by Sanger method. Mutations were selected considering variability <0.01 (SiteVar algorithm) with respect to 14,144 mitochondrial genomes from healthy individuals. To determine whether the selected mutations were somatically acquired, we sequenced the matched germ line DNAs. We found 3 somatic missense mutations in CO1, CO2, CYTB genes in HR patients and 1 in (mt) tRNA gene in LR patients. Moreover, we identified 47 germ line mutations: 5 were novel (2 missense and 2 tRNA mutations in HR and 1 insertion in LR patients); 10 (83.3%) rare missense mutations occurred in HR and 2 (16.7%) in LR patients. Genes with higher germ line mutation frequency in HR patients than in LR ones included CYTB (20.0% vs 6.2%), ND1 (10.0% vs 0.0%), and (mt) tRNA (25.0% vs 12.5%). All CYTB and ND1 mutations in HR patients were missense. The highest rate of rare mutations was found in mt tRNA gene (19.4% of cases). In HR patients, two mutations (one novel) in tRNA thr altered (mt) tRNA secondary structure and one novel mutation occurred in the anticodon loop of tRNA gly. In agreement with recent high throughput screenings of nuclear DNAs, the rate of somatic mitochondrial mutations in neuroblastoma is low.

21812,"Biallelic mutations in BUB1B cause Mosaic Variegated Aneuploidy (MVA) syndrome, characterized by microcephaly, growth retardation, intellectual disability and cancer predisposition. BUB1B encodes a kinase involved in spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) function. We describe a boy with PDD NOS who developed acute lymphoblastic leukemia at age 9 years and pri mary diffuse leptomeningeal gliomatosis at age 17 years. His father, aged 54 years, had a head circumference at 2 SD and developed a brain tumor at the age of 19 years. They both were found to carry a monoallelic deletion of exons 9 23 of BUB1B. Karyotyping of EBV transformed lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCL) from both father and son, revealed an enrichment of aneuploid cells (10% in both) and a significant increase in premature sister chromatid separation compared to controls. Since these two patients presented with features of the MVA syndrome, but did not present the full blown pheno type, we hypothesized that this could be explained by BUBR1 protein ex pression levels below 50%. To study this hypothesis, BUB1B mRNA and BU BR1 protein expression levels were measured in EBV transformed LCLs of the two cases. Expression levels were ~50% and, therefore, in concordance with a deletion of one BUB1B allele. Our findings suggest a role for hetero zygous germline mutations in BUB1B in cancer predisposition, outside the context of classic MVA syndrome. An explanation might be found in digenic inheritance. To study this hypothesis, we will perform exome sequencing on germline DNA of the son and initially we will search for aberrations in SAC genes in particular.",2014
21813,"We describe the finding of somatic mosaicism for a pathogenic variant of the MSH2 gene in the parent of a proband with Lynch Syndrome. The proband was diagnosed with a colorectal tumor at age 50 that was immunodeficient for MSH2 and MSH6. Sequencing and MLPA analysis of MSH2, MSH6 and MLH1 in a blood sample revealed the presence of a heterozygous pathoge nic variant in the MSH2 gene, c.920_923deITCAG (p. Val307Glufs*23). The father was found to have a low level of mosaicism, <10%, for this variant in DNA from blood. This finding was confirmed on a buccal sample from him which showed a greater proportion of the pathogenic variant, ~20%. The father had been diagnosed with prostate cancer at age 70 and his family hi story is not suggestive of Lynch Syndrome. The motherÃ¢ÂÂs sample was negati ve and parentage was confirmed using microsatellite loci. BRCA1/2 analysis was negative in the probandÃ¢ÂÂs sister who was diagnosed with uterine and ovarian cancer at age 37. She was found to be a carrier of this MSH2 patho genic variant. The results in this family suggest the pathogenic variant arose as an early postzygotic mutation in the father of the proband. Documented incidents of de novo mutation of the mismatch repair genes (MMR) in Lynch syndrome are rare. Our findings lend further support to the suggestion that HNPCC like histopathological characteristics of tumours in addition to re vised Bethesda criteria be used to improve ascertainment of individuals and families at risk of Lynch Syndrome.",2014

Comparison of individuals who tested positive and negative revealed considerable overlap between the two groups with respect to clinical characteristics indicative of an inherited can cer syndrome, suggesting that many of the latter group also have a genetic basis. Analysis of PTEN and TP53, however, did not reveal any significant variants. Failure to detect a germline mutation may result from mosaicism for a mutation in a known inherited cancer gene, an unusual phenotype that leads to the relevant gene being overlooked or mutation in a novel in herited cancer gene. To address these possible explanations, further cases are being identified and next generation sequencing techniques applied to blood samples from the series. Initial analysis is being performed using the Ilumina TruSight cancer panel (of known inherited cancer genes) with sub sequent whole exome or genome sequencing if no mutation is identified. Tu mour samples will also be analysed for loss of heterozygosity at the relevant locus where putative mutations are found. Recruitment is currently open.",2014
21815,"Introduction. Biallelic MUTYH mutation carriers have a predisposition to colorectal carcinoma (CRC) and polyp development, but the severity of the phenotype is highly variable. We investigated whether this can be explained by the presence of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) which have pre viously been implicated in the susceptibility to CRC and polyps in genome wide association studies (GWAS).Method. 154 MAP patients from three countries (UK,NL and DE) were geno typed for 17 SNPs previously identified by GWAS. Data were analysed with ANOVA and cox regression analysis. Homozygotes for the non risk allele were used as reference category. Results. A CRC odds ratio (OR) was identified for rs10936599 of 5.101 (95% CI:0.761 34.206) for heterozygotes and 1.403 (CI:0.234 8.415) for homozygotes (p,0.022). The CRC OR for rs10795668 in this cohort is 5.470 (CI: 1.413 21.171) for heterozygotes and 4.684 (CI:1.200 18.289) for ho mozygotes (p,0.042). For rs961253 heterozygotes an OR for having more than 100 polyps of 2.887 (CI:1.274 6.541) was identified, this is 1.041 (CI:0.299 3.622) for homozygotes (p,0.021). For two SNPs (rs3802842 and rs16892766) previously associated with CRC risk in Lynch patients, a significant pair wise effect on difference in age of diagnosis (of 12 years) was identified between patients with zero and more than 1 risk alleles (p,0.015). Discussion. There is evidence for an effect of GWAS SNPs in MAP patients. However, a larger cohort size is needed to truly determine this effect. Unra velling risk factors like SNPs in MAP patients might allow for individual risk stratification and personalised surveillance programs in the future.",2014
21816,"Infantile myofibromatosis (IM) is a rare disorder characterized by the deve lopment of benign tumors in the skin, muscle, bone, and viscera. The inci dence is 1/150,000 live births and the disease is the most common cause of fibrous tumors in infancy. Although the identification of mutations in genes that may cause IM is the first step towards the possibility of targeted treat ments, the molecular pathogenesis of IM is still poorly understood. Recently, mutations in PDGFRB and NOTCH3 have been implicated in families with the autosomal dominant forms of IM. We have performed whole exome se quencing of a family with a probably autosomal recessive visceral multicen tric infantile myofibromatosis. We studied two brothers and their healthy consanguineous parents. In the two brothers we identified a c.511G>C (p. Val171Leu) novel homozygous mutation in NDRG4 (N myc downregula ted gene family member 4). The healthy parents were heterozygous for the mutation. Consistent with the phenotype of IM, NDRG4 is a tumor related gene. Its expression has been shown to be decreased in numerous types of neoplasia and there have been proposed that it might be a tumor suppres sor gene. Additionally, studies have demonstrated that NDRG4 may have a role in cell survival, tumor invasion and angiogenesis in tumors. We believe that this homozygous mutation in NDRG4 may be a good candidate for the causative variant of the autosomal recessive form of IM in the family studied and we propose that it should be investigated in other cases of autosomal recessive infantile myofibromatosis.

Genetic predisposition to breast and/or ovarian cancer is largerly confined to mutations in BRCA1/2 genes, although rarer mutations in other known genes (e.g. TP53, PTEN, STK11, CDH1, PALB2, BRIP1, CHEK2 etc.) are also important. Massivelly parralel (or next generation, NGS) rese quencing technology is attractive for identifing cancer predsposing mutati ons in known genes (panels) and discover new associations. METHODS. We aimed to better characterize cancer predisposing landsca pe in clinicaly selected 96 breast and 96 ovarian cancer cases (with strong family history or early age at diagnosis and negative for previously tested BRCA1/2 genes mutations) by perfoming NGS based analysis of 94 genes previously associated with both common (e.g., breast, colorectal) and rare cancers (TruSight Cancer Nextera Custom hybridization based target en richment) on MiSeq (Illumina). VariantStudio software was used for anota tion and filtering of genetic variants. RESULTS. Of 192 tested subjects, 8% carried germline loss of function mu tations (confirmed by Sanger sequencing) in 10 cancer predisposing genes, 3 of them were not previously implicated in hereditary breast/ovarian can cer predisposition.

IL 1RN Variable Number of Tandem Repeats (VNTR in intron 2), IL 1ÃÂ² 511C/T [rs16944], IL 6 597G/A [rs1800797] and TNF ÃÂ± 308 G/A [rs1800629] with oral cancer in a north Indian population. Clinical and addiction details of healthy age/sex matched controls (n,140) and OSCC patients (n,77) were recorded after ethical clearance and consent. DNA was extracted and SNPs genotyped by polymerase chain reaction and restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR RFLP). Minor allele frequencies; genotype and allele frequencies were calculated by chi square (ÃÂ2) analysis (SPSS v.15.0). Gene gene interaction, pairwise linkage disequilibrium (LD) based on DÃ¢ÂÂ statistics and correlation coefficient (r2) of frequencies were analyzed using SHEsis (online version). Genotypic frequencies of IL 1RN, IL 1ÃÂ² and IL 6 while allelic frequency of IL 6 showed significant association with OSCC (P<0.001). TNF ÃÂ± increases risk of OSCC upto 1.68 times in alcoholic subjects. GATI* and GGTII* haploty pes increased the risk up to 2.863 and 38.285 times respectively. This is the first report from India showing the effect of cytokine gene polymorphisms in OSCC to predict individuals at risk of oral cancer.

In November 2012 a pilot proto col was developed by the Unit of Hereditary Cancer (UHC) and the Oncology Service (OS) caring most OC patients in our Institute, to assess the feasibility of offering genetic counselling (GC) to all OC women. Oncologists agreed to propose GC during their clinics and to refer all interested OC patients by directly arrange a contact with UHC. After the first year we evaluated onco logistsÃ¢ÂÂ adherence to protocol, patientsÃ¢ÂÂ compliance with GC and testing, and prevalence of BRCA1/2 mutations. Results: 104 OC women underwent an oncology visit from November 2012 to December 2013. Ten patients were excluded because they had GC in the past. Only 29 patients (29/94; 31%) were referred to GC; 22/29 attended GC (76%) and 21/22 had genetic testing (95%). Three pathogenic BRCA mutations were detected (3/21; 14%); among healthy female close relati ves, seven were tested and three were mutation positive. Referral was much higher for patients attending the first visit (14/26; 54%) than for follow up patients (15/68; 22%). The main differences in these two settings are the time schedule (one vs half an hour) and the checklist in the clinical record (including or not family history). Conclusions: PatientsÃ¢ÂÂ compliance to GC/testing was high, and BRCA mu tation prevalence was as expected. However, oncologistsÃ¢ÂÂ compliance was low, mainly because of practical barriers.

21820,"Introduction Despite initial response to first line platinum based chemo therapy, more than 80% of high grade serous ovarian cancer patients relap se and develop resistance. The molecular and genetic features involved in drug resistance are still unknown. By gene expression profile in a cohort of patients from which matched biopsies were taken at primary surgery (PS O) when tumor was sensitive to chemotherapy and at time of relapse (SCR) when the tumor was resistant, we identified EMT pathway as a key player in tumor relapse (Marchini et al., 2013). Here we investigate the genomic al terations driving drug resistance by performing targeted DNA resequencing on our cohort of SCR and PS O samples. Methods DNA libraries enriched in a selected panel of 30 genes encom passing key players of signal transduction, cell cycle and DNA repair were generated using TruSeq Custom Amplicon kit and sequenced on MiSeq (Il lumina). Data were analyzed using a high performance cluster computing platform (Cloud4CARE project).Results Analysis identified a total of 166 mutations (152 SNPs and 14 In Dels), of which 51 affecting PS O and 115 SCR. With a 500X coverage, we observed BRCA1, BRCA2 and TP53 mutated in the majority of cases. In addi tion, the PI3K pathway was found mutated in SCR samples only.

21821,"Epithelial Ovarian Cancer (EOC) is the most lethal female reproductive tract malignancy. Most patients present with advanced stage disease and the cornerstone of treatment is surgical debulking followed by platinum based chemotherapy. The major contributor to the high fatality to case ratio is chemoresistant disease. We sought to identify candidate biomarkers/pa thways which could distinguish between platinum sensitivity and platinum resistance and test their prognostic ability. Ovarian tumor samples from pa tients with primary high grade serous ovarian cancer were divided into two groups based on response to platinum status. Transcriptome analysis was performed using RNA Seq and Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) was used to explore differences between these two sets of samples. Findings were va lidated using qRT PCR. Survival analysis was performed in two independent sample sets: gene expression data (GEO); relapse free/overall survival in formation, (EGA, TCGA). IPA highlighted that Interferon regulatory factor 1 (IRF1) was differential ly expressed between the two clinical groups and was upregulated in the platinum sensitive group. Validation studies performed on 31 patient tumor samples demonstrated a significant difference in PFS between the low and high IRF1 groups (P , 0.027) as well as a distinct difference in the proba bility of recurrence. In conclusion, we have shown that high levels of IRF1 strongly correlated with increased overall survival in late stage disease re gardless of debulking status and grade in those patients who received pla tinum therapy.",2014

Introduction: The role of p53 (17p13.1) in the pathogenesis of pancreatic acinar cell carcinomas (ACCs) has not been fully clarified yet. Few studies, mainly using immunohistochemistry (IHC), suggested that p53 is not in volved in ACCs but molecular data are controversial. Recently, p53 muta tion and a significant (>50% of cells) p53 nuclear immunoreactivity (IR) have been reported in 20% and 27% of ACCs, respectively. Aim: To clarify the role of p53 in the pathogenesis of ACCs we investigate p53 alterations (mutation, methylation, loss and nuclear protein expression) in 44 ACCs using different approaches: direct sequencing of exons 5 8, MS MLPA, FISH and IHC. Results: p53 mutations were found in 8/44 (18%) cases, corre lated with higher tumor stage (5 cases were at stage IV). In one case, p53 mutation was observed only in the metastasis of a primary p53 wild type ACC. Methylation of p53 was observed in only one case. Loss of p53 gene, including 17p13.1 deletion and monosomy of chromosome 17, was found in 50% of ACCs and in 4 cases a concomitant mutation was identified. The simultaneous presence of both p53 mutation and loss correlated with worse prognosis (p,0.001). Conclusions: p53 alterations including mutations and cytogenetic loss are frequent in ACCs. p53 mutation and loss are correlated with higher tumor stage and with worse prognosis. Our results suggest that p53 is not an early event in ACC tumorigenesis, but it is involved in late pha ses of cancer progression.",2014

Results: Fifteen (16.7%) carried a founder Ashkenazi mutation in either BRCA1or BRCA2: of these, nine (60%) carried the 6174delT mutation in BR CA2; five (33.3%) and one (6.7%) harbored the 185delAG and the 5382insC mutations in BRCA1, respectively. Carriers compared to non carriers were diagnosed at 61ÃÂ±7.5 and 63.0ÃÂ±11.3 years of age, respectively (p,0.520); and have higher BMI levels (28.9ÃÂ±7.3 compared to 25.1ÃÂ±4.9; p,0.112).

At least a third of patients with phaeochromocytoma (PCC) or paraganglioma (PGL) harbour an underlying germline mutation in a known PCC/PGL gene. Mutations in SDHx genes (SDHB, SDHD, SDHD and SDHA) encoding a com ponent of the TCA cycle, succinate dehydrogenase (SDH), are a major cause of inherited PCC/PGL. SDHB mutations are also associated with inherited renal cell carcinoma (RCC). Inactivation of SDH in tumour cells results in abnormalities of cellular metabolism associated with activation of hypoxic gene response pathways and epigenetic alterations (e.g. DNA methylation). Similar findings have recently been reported in cases with mutations the FH gene, which encodes the TCA cycle component directly downstream of SDH, fumarate hydratase. However, the clinical phenotype of germline mutations in SDHx genes and FH is usually distinct with FH mutations classically as sociated with hereditary cutaneous and uterine leiomyomatosis and renal cell carcinoma. In order to identify potential novel PCC/PGL predisposition genes we undertook an exome resequencing study in a case of childhood PCC. After identifying a candidate FH missense mutation (p.

We then performed In vitro analyses and demonstrated that both missense mutations were associated with elevated intracellular fumarate levels compared to a wild type rescue construct.

21828,"Background: Most of the proteins that are encoded by oncogenes which play a role in molecular pathogenesis of cancer, function as protein kinases. Acquired constitutional activity of these proteins leads to the activation of signaling pathways which are involved in cell proliferation, apoptosis, pro tein synthesis, cell migration and many other cellular processes. One of the most important signaling pathways that plays role in the pathogenesis of cancer is phosphatidyl inositol 3 kinase (PI3K) signaling pathway. Especially class IA PI3Ks are known to play a role in the pathogenesis of cancer. Basi cally, p110ÃÂ± isoform of catalytic domain accounts for the enzymatic function of class IA PI3Ks. It is encoded by PIK3CA gene. PIK3CA mutations has been previously reported in many cancers. Methods: All exons of the PIK3CA gene were sequenced in 40 NSCLC tumor samples. All individuals provided informed consent, and the study was per formed in accordance with ethical guidelines. Results: The 1634A>C mutation which has already been identified in many cancers and NSCLC was determined in 7,5% of the tumor tissue samples. This mutation rate is higher than reported in the literature. Interestingly a second mutation (1658_1659delGTinsC) was identified in these patients. The concurrence of these two mutations has been reported as Cowden syndrome in the literature which is known to be a cancer predisposition syndrome.

However, secondary resistance inevi tably ensues in all patients within 3 12 months from the start of therapy. The mechanism and timing of emergence of resistance which limit the ef ficacy of these drugs, is highly relevant for designing therapeutic strategies. Methods: We examined the plasma DNA of 10 KRAS wild type mCRC pati ents who received anti EGFR therapy, using a high throughput whole geno me sequencing (Plasma Seq) and ultra deep sequencing of genes associated with resistance to anti EGFR therapy such as KRAS, BRAF , PIK3CA and EGFR with IlluminaÃ¢ÂÂs MiSeq. Results: Genome wide characterisation of the plas ma DNA and corresponding primary tumor revealed several tumor specific aberrations such as over representation of chromosomes 8q, 13 and 20q, and losses of 8p, 4 and 18. The development of resistance to anti EGFR the rapy was observed to be associated with novel focal amplification of KRAS (n,3), MET (n,2) and ERBB2 (n,1) or high level polysomy of 12p which includes KRAS (n,1). Overrepresentation of EGFR gene was associated with initial good response to therapy. However, ultra deep sequencing of KRAS, BRAF, PIK3CA and EGFR did not reveal any novel mutations. Conclusion: Overall, predictive biomarkers associated with the anti EGFR therapy effica cy, correlating well with treatment response was identified in 70% of our patients.

Biallelic mutations lead to constitutional MMR deficiency syndrome (CMMR D) in which various types of malignancy occur early in life. Isolated loss of PMS2, detected by immunohistochemistry in tumours directs mutation scanning to PMS2 to diagnose LS and CMMR D. Mutation scanning of this gene has been notoriously difficult due to the presence of highly homologous pseudogene sequences and frequent gene conversion events. Here we present results of recently improved DNA based and RNA based mutation detection strategies for PMS2 as obtained in the five Dutch accredited diagnostic laboratories that offer PMS2 genetic testing. Altogether, 53 different deleterious PMS2 mutations were discovered in 126 LS and 8 CMMRD index patients. Recurrent PMS2 mutations, probably of founder origin, appear to be common in the Dutch cohort: 15 mutations found in at least 3 probands represent 68% (96/142) of mutated alleles. Notably, one such recurrent mutation, detected in 3 probands in our cohort, is the recently described retrotranspositional insertion of an SVA repeat, that is missed by current DNA based protocols. Pathogenic PMS2 mutati ons were found in 78% (57/73) of patients with isolated PMS2 loss, and another 10% (n,7) could be explained by an MLH1 mutation (data from 2 labs with complete data set).

A total of 63 index cases fulfilling Amsterdam II criteria with normal ex pression of mismatch repair proteins and microsatellite stable tumors were included. Sanger sequencing of POLE exon13 and POLD1 exon11 was per formed. None of the cases carried mutations in POLE. We found one case with a new POLD1 variant in heterozygosis: c.1421T>C (p. Leu474Pro). The patient was a woman who underwent a synchronous CRC and large bowel gastrointe stinal stromal tumor at age 36. Her maternal aunt had metachronous CRC (dx33y) and endometrial cancer (dx56y) and was a carrier of this variant. Therefore, the index caseÃ¢ÂÂs mother, who underwent endometrial cancer (dx52y), was an obligate variant carrier. It has been described that the ho mologous residue of POLD1 p.

Palles et al employed whole genome sequencing and detected the p. Leu424Val (L424V) mutation in 12 families, with no evidence of a shared common ancestor. The phenotypes of these families were consistent with an autosomal dominant predisposi tion to colorectal adenomas and carcinomas, with some individuals having multiple tumours. Tumours from these subjects were all microsatellite stab le (MSI S) and did not show any preponderance of site within the colon or particular morphology. There were no extra colonic tumours described in any affected individuals in these families. Following the identification POLE L424V in our family through the CORGI study, subsequent testing identified the familial mutation in an individual with an MSI unstable (MSI H) tumour and synchronous duodenal adenocarcinoma, rectal carcinoma and adeno mas. It was also noted that all the individuals affected with colorectal cancer in this family also have diabetes, consistent across 3 generations. The co segregation of diabetes and colorectal cancer requires formal confirmati on in some relatives. This association warrants further study. An increased risk of CRC in patients with diabetes mellitus has been recognised for some years. Emerging evidence that polymerase D (POLD1) gene has an impor tant function in adipose tissue homeostasis lends weight to the associati on. This family provides evidence of a broader phenotype of malignancy in POLE, and opportunity for new investigations into the possible mechanism linking diabetes and colorectal cancer.",2014
21833,"Aim: The production of prostaglandins, especially prostaglandin E synthe tase (PGE2) is hypothesized to influence carcinogenesis by promoting cell proliferation, inhibiting apoptosis, stimulating angiogenesis, and mediating immune suppression. Cyclooxygenase 2 (Cox 2), the inducible isoform of cyclooxygenase coded by the PTGS2 gene, is the key enzyme in the produc tion of prostaglandins involved in inflammatory processes including cancer. In melanoma skin cancer, Cox 2 is overexpressed in primary malignant me lanoma and in their corresponding metastases. Aim of this study was to in vestigate if polymorphisms 765G>C (rs20417), and 1195A>G (rs689466) in the PTGS2 gene impact on its expression in dermal fibroblasts and are as sociated with individual susceptibility to malignant cutaneous melanoma. Methods: Two hundred forty patients presenting melanoma and 342 con trol individuals were genotyped for polymorphisms 765G>C (rs20417) and 1195A>G (rs689466) by restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR RFLP) analysis. PTGS2 gene expression was performed by Real Time PCR using Sybr Green. Results: The allele 765C was associated with an increased prevalence of melanoma. No association of 1195A>G polymorphism was observed. Ha plotype analysis of both variations showed that the haplotypes carrying the minor alleles were associated to a higher risk of melanoma (p,0.02). Ex pression analysis indicated that allele 765C is associated to a higher gene expression and thus could represent a risk allele by affecting the functiona lity of the promoter. Conclusion: In conclusion, variant 765G>C may be associated to malignant cutaneous melanoma with a low penetrance effect and this effect could be a consequence of altered gene expression.",2014
21834,"The primary myelofibrosis (PMF) is characterized by clonal proliferation of the hematopoietic precursors, fibrosis, osteosclerosis and angiogenesis. Bone marrow fibrosis is a reactive process, where the fibroblast proliferati on is in response to cytokines, such as platelet derived growth factor (PDGF) and the basic fibroblastic growth factor (FGF2), produced by malignant megakaryocytes or monocytes. No specific prognostic markers are today available to refine the clinical classification and the risk to develop fibrosis. The purpose of this study is to investigate DNA methylation of PDGFB and FGF2, to verify possible associations among the epigenetic profile fibrosis progression and prognosis of PMF. The methylation is evaluated by pyro sequencing in a cohort of 58 PMF cases and 20 controls. The methylation percentages of PDGFB and FGF2 in PMF ranged from a complete demethyla tion to hypermethylation (PDGFB range: 3 95, mean value: 39; FGF2 range: 1 96%, mean value: 40), in controls the methylation values of both genes are clustered in more restricted intervals (PDGFB: 28 46% mean value: 35; FGF2: 16 43% mean value: 28). The methylation values of PDGFB and FGF2 are significantly increased in the prefibrotic cases compared to controls (PDGFB: 71 vs. 33, p < 0.0005 and FGF2: 56 vs. 27.5, p < 0.0005). Interestin gly hypomethylated PDGFB was an indicator of better prognosis for fibrosis, International Prognostic Scoring System (IPPS) and Dynamic International Prognostic Scoring System (DIPPS) progression (p,0.03, p,0.02 and p,0.01 respectively).",2014
21835,"Prostate cancer is a complex disorder resulting from the combined effects of multiple environmental and genetic factors. Our previous single locus ana lysis showed that VEGF and HSP70 hom polymorphisms were significantly associated with prostate cancer susceptibility and prognosis. Both genes encoding these proteins were located on chromosome 6p21, and combining the neighboring SNPs into haplotypes may increase the association with the disease. Three tagging polymorphisms, the HSP70 hom 2437 T/C, the VEGF 1154 G/A and the VEGF 634 G/C SNPs were genotyped in 101 cases and 80 controls. For the combined analysis of VEGF and HSP70 hom , we found a positive gradient in the ORs related to the number of high risk genotypes with a 3.53 fold increase of prostate carcinoma risk (OR, 3.53; P, 0.015). Furthermore, The TAG and CAG haplotypes at positions HSP70 hom , VEGF 1154 and VEGF 634 exhibited a twofold (OR, 0.46; P, 0.014) and a seven fold (OR, 0.14; P, 0.00005) reduction in prostate cancer risk, respectively. Regarding prostate cancer prognosis, the TAG haplotype had a negative as sociation with the aggressive phenotype as defined by the histopathological grade (OR, 0.28; P, 0.006).

The clinicopathological association of rare BRAF variants other than V600E ABSTRACTS POSTERS ESHG 2014 | MILAN, ITALY | WWW. ESHG. ORG 262Back to inde x mutation is still obscure. Methods: We evaluated a total of 1067 consecutive patients with malignant or indeterminate thyroid nodules by ultrasonography. All fine needle aspi ration cytology (FNAC) samples were tested for BRAF mutation using mu tant enrichment with 3Ã¢ÂÂ modified oligonucleotide (MEMO) sequencing with real time PCR concurrently. Rare BRAF variants were evaluated with regard to cytology and/or histology results. Results: BRAF mutations were detected in 37.9% (404/1067) of all samples. The V600E mutation was detected in 98.3% (397/404), and six rare vari ants were detected by MEMO sequencing. Three types of variants were iden tified: c.1799_1801del (p. Val600_Lys601delinsGlu), c.1794_1795insGTT (p. Ala598_Thr599insVal), and c.1801A>T (p. Lys601*). The former two are known mutations to be associated with PTC and three patients with these mutations were diagnosed as PTC histologically. The third variant was novel. The case with c.1801A>T was diagnosed as a benign follicular nodule. Conclusions: Out of 1067 thyroid nodule cytology samples, six (0.56%) had rare BRAF variants. A novel variant was identified in a cytologically benign thyroid nodule. Targeted testing for detecting only the V600E mutation may be good enough to increase the diagnostic value of FNAC, however, iden tification of other variants in BRAF gene may provide additional valuable information on the nature of thyroid nodules in the future.",2014

Despite this, some patients show non response or even disease progression. Recent studies suggest that different genetic alterations may be associated with sensitivity vs. resistance of rectal cancer tumor cells to neoadjuvant therapy. We inve stigated the relationship between intratumoral pathways of clonal evoluti on as assessed by iFISH (51 different probes) and response to neoadjuvant radiochemotherapy, evaluated by Dworak criteria in 45 rectal cancer tu mors before (n,45) and after (n,31) treatment. Losses of chromosomes 1p (44%), 8p (53%), 17p (47%), 18q (38%) and gains of 1q (49%), 13q (75%) as well as amplification of 8q (38%) and 20q (47%) chromosomal regions were those specific alterations found at higher frequencies. Significant as sociation (p<0.05) was found between alteration of 1p, 1q, 11p, 12p and 17p chromosomal regions and degree of response to neoadjuvant therapy. A clear association was observed between cytogenetic profile of the ancestral tumor cell clone and response to radiochemotherapy; cases presenting with del(17p) showed a poor response to neoadjuvant treatment (p,0.03), while presence of del(1p) was more frequently observed in responder patients (p,0.0002). Moreover, a significantly higher number of copies of chromoso mes 8q (p,0.004), 13q (p,0.003) and 20q (p,0.002) were found after the rapy vs. paired pre treatment rectal cancer samples.

To discover the underlying epigenetic pathways that may play a role in drug resistance and relapse, we performed Infinium HumanMe thylation450K BeadChip arrays and to characterize the molecular evolution of relapsed childhood ALL, we used Illumina HumanCytoSNP 12 arrays to identify somatic copy number alterations (CNAs) in 16 diagnosis/relapse pairs. Flow sorted normal B cell progenitor subpopulations and CD4+CD8+ T cell purified from thymus were used as controls. Analysis variant CpG sites in an unsupervised manner, we identified three distinct DNA methylation profiles in samples according to their structural variations. ALL cases did not show significant differences between paired diagnose/ relapse samples though they had hyper DNA methylation than control samples. Aberrant DNA methylation had been detected in negative regulator of cell cycle genes and DNA damage repair genes in ALL. Copy number analysis of patients revealed varying numbers of genetic lesions ranging from 0 to 45 CNAs per sample. The vast majority of CNAs obser ved were shared between diagnosis and relapse in the same patients. One of the most frequent CNAs involved deletions of CDKN2A/B , occurring in 8 patients, 2 of 8 patients lost the CDKN2A/B at relapse time. Integration of methylation and genotyping data revealed high concordance.

All examined tumors and their control tissues of histological normal ap pearance share alteration in regulation of specific pathways. In TRCC we found higher number (48) of methylated tumor suppressor genes (TSG) than in PRCC (35). Only TSG DPH1 and VHL were found to be distinctive ly methylated in all PRCC. The methylation of gene sequences SPIB, PLAT , PCDHB1 and FAF2 was found exclusively in TRCC tumor samples, the me thylation in genes KIFC3, MDH2, PAG1, BICD1, PLG and CTRL was limited to all PRCC tumor samples only. Using bioinformatics tools (DAVID and GSEA), we found the pathways and genes which are altered by differential methylation and which may be re sponsible for developmental divergence of both tumors from precancerous renal tissue. The genes involved in transmembrane transport of small mole cules, lipoprotein metabolism and transmission across chemical synapsis are significantly overrepresented among genes methylated preferentially in TRCC, PRCC is characterized by overrepresentation of genes playing roles in RNA metabolism and processing.

21840,"Objectives: Retinoblastoma is the paradigm of hereditary cancer. Appro ximately, 40% of patients carry germline mutations in the retinoblastoma gene RB1 that predispose to develop retinoblastoma. These mutations can be detectable in blood DNA using standard techniques. However, these tech niques are not sensitive enough to detect mosaicism in sporadic cases of the disease (without family history). This study was thus designed to determi ne the frequency of mosaicism in patients with sporadic retinoblastoma by using next generation sequencing (NGS) technologies. Methods: We selected for this study 22 patients with sporadic retinoblasto ma in which we had previously identified two inactivating mutations in the RB1 gene in tumor DNA, but in which none of those mutations were de tected in blood DNA using Sanger sequencing. Blood DNA of these patients was analyzed by NGS (Roche/454) in order to identify in low proportion ABSTRACTS POSTERS ESHG 2014 | MILAN, ITALY | WWW. ESHG.

The frequency of the mutations in blood DNA ranged between 0.8 and 16.8%. Conclusion: Roche/454 sequencing is very sensitive allowing the identifica tion of mosaicism in patients with sporadic retinoblastoma. The existence of mosaicism can modify the risk of retinoblastoma and the probability of transmitting the mutation to offspring. Therefore, the identification of mo saicism in these patients improves genetic diagnosis.",2014

Very little is known about etiology of these malignancies, the only documented etiolo gic factor in less then 25% of these tumors is previous pelvic irradiation and some have been linked to tamoxifen treatment. We report that BRCA1 & TP53 germline mutations are associated with gynecologic sarcomas.<br /Methods: During the last ten years 16 patients diagnosed with gynecologic sarcoma were seen at Genetic Counseling Unit at Cancer Center & Institute of Onco logy in Warsaw. All the patients were offered genetic testing, after genetic counseling and after obtaining the written informed consent. The consent protocol was accepted by the local ethical committee. BRCA1 analysis was performed on DNA from the peripheral blood leukocytes. The mutations in BRCA1 were detected using DHPLC and sequencing of exons 2, 5, 11 and 20, where the Polish founder mutations are found most frequently.

21842,"Interactions between genetic, epigenetic and genotoxic factors play a pivotal role in secondary acute myeloid leukemia (s AML) development. The GSTP1 is a well known housekeeping gene engaged in the detoxification of a varie ty of carcinogens. We hypothesized that genetic and epigenetic mechanisms resulting in reduction or inactivation of GSTP1 expression may be implica ted in s AML pathogenesis. Thus, we investigated the possible implication of the A313G germline polymorphism in s AML development and/or its spe cific chromosomal abnormalities. Moreover, we studied the possible con tribution of GSTP1 promoter hypermethylation in s AML development and the methylation status in respect to patientsÃ¢ÂÂ genotype. Concerning GSTP1 genotyping, a case control study in 75 s AML patients and 185 controls was performed by Real Time PCR. The GSTP1 hypermethylation was studied by methylation specific PCR in 40 of the above cases and 15 controls. The genotypic distribution between cases and controls revealed a statistically higher frequency of the variant genotypes (A/G, G/G) in s AML compared to the controls (p,0.001). Allele frequency distribution analysis showed that s AML patients exhibited an almost 2 fold increased risk of carrying at least one variant G allele compared to the controls. Stratification of patients ac cording to the karyotype revealed a significantly increased frequency of A/G heterozygotes in patients carrying 7/del(7q) (89.5%). The GSTP1 promoter was hypermethylated in a large proportion of s AML patients (32.5%), but in none of the controls. No statistically significant associations were found between the methylation status and GSTP1 genotype. Our findings provide evidence for an important role of the GSTP1 gene in AML pathogenesis.",2014

Background: The identification of recurrent translocations in neoplasia has been used to identify the genes involved in the neoplastic process in order to develop new therapies. The objective of our study was to determine if the breakpoints determined by conventional cytogenetics in two apparently re current translocations (3;12)(q13;p13) were the same at the molecular level. Material and Methods. Two patients with myelodysplastic syndrome had a complex karyotype including a translocation (3;12)(q13;p13). In addition to the translocation, both karyotypes shared a deletion of chromosome 5 and a trisomy of the chromosome 8. A set of 35 Bacterial Artificial Chromosomes (BACs) were used to cover the 3p11.1 q13.32 region and a set of 12 BACs were used to cover the 12 p11.21 p13.31 region. Results. The breakpoints were precisely established only for the translocation t(3;12)(q13;p13) in patient 1, within the BAC RP11 491D12 at the 3p11.2 region and within the BAC RP11 705C15 at the 12p13.31 region. A region of 22.458 kbp was dele ted including the 12p13.2 12p11.21 region. In patient 2 the breakpoints on chromosomes 3 and 12 were not found, but based on the BACs study they should be more centromeric than the breakpoints determined in patient 1. A deleted region of 23.163,9 kbp including the 12p13.2 12p11.21 region was found in patient 2. Conclusion: BACs studies revealed that the breakpoints in two apparently recurrent translocations were different at the molecular level. Both translocations showed a deletion of 22.458 kbp 23.163,9 kbp near the breakpoint, including the 12p13.2 12p11.21 region.",2014
21845,"Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a subtype of breast cancer that lacks ER, PR and HER2 expression. TNBCs have a gene expression profile similar to breast tumours BRCA mutations. However, despite this correlation, there have not been many studies showing the prevalence of BRCA mutations in TNBC patients. It has been proposed that women with TNBCs may be can didates for genetic screening due to their shared phenotype with breast tu mours of BRCA mutation carriers. The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence of germline BRCA mutations in TNBC cases unselected for family history of the disease. This knowledge could aid in the selection of women who could be candidates for genetic testing. The study cohort comprised of 347 TNBC patients. BRCA genes were ampli fied by Fluidigm Access Array. The amplicons were sequenced on Illumina MiSeq. The sequencing data were analysed with NextGENe 2nd Generation Sequencing Software.

Our study shows that in a large cohort of TNBC patients unselected for fa mily history of breast cancer, approximately 11.2% of the patients harbour a BRCA mutation. This suggests that there may be an underestimation of BRCA mutations in a breast cancer population using current screening cri teria, and TNBCs should be considered as an inclusion criterion for genetic testing.",2014

Non synonymous missense changes that result in amino acid substitutions represent the majority of variants of uncertain clinical significance (VUSs) identified by genetic testing. We sought to analyze whether commonly used in silico tools, which assess the phylogenetic conservation of specific ami no acids throughout evolution, can accurately characterize the possible disease association of missense mutations. We compared the accuracy of six commonly used algorithms (Align GVGD, SIFT , PolyPhen 2, MAPP MMR, SIFT , Grantham Analysis and Condel) using a dataset of 1,118 BRCA1, BR CA2, MLH1 and MSH2 variants previously classified as clinically deleterious or benign by our laboratoryÃ¢ÂÂs variant classification program. For all algo rithms (except Align GVGD), the false positive (FP) rate compared to our laboratoryÃ¢ÂÂs variant classification program was higher than traditionally ac cepted thresholds for clinical confidence, with a range from 30.6% 58.5% for BRCA1, 27.1% 40.1% for BRCA2, 17.9% 67.9% for MLH1 and 17.1% 56.1% for MSH2. Although the FP rates using Align GVGD for all four genes were lower, including values of 2.2% for BRCA1 and 7.9% for BRCA2, the sample size was too small to provide a robust analysis. The high FP rates for Condel, which classifies variants based on a weighted average of scores from five in silico tools, suggests that the use of multiple models is not significant ly more accurate than any of the individual models in isolation.

21847,"A fraction of sequence variants found in disease causing genes induce aber rant splicing. At the moment, reliable splice prediction tools are only avai lable for variants in the consensus splice site regions, and even these cannot predict the exact molecular nature of the aberrant transcription. Wet lab splicing assays, either RT PCR analyses of patient RNA or functional splicing reporter minigene tests, have to be performed to confirm aberrant splicing. Here, we present results of splicing reporter minigene assays performed for 37 disease gene variants of unknown significance (VUS), mainly found in the four DNA mismatch repair genes MLH1, MSH2 , MSH6 and PMS2 that are associated with Lynch syndrome. Twenty variants are located in the con sensus splice site regions, 13 are exonic and 4 are deep intronic variants. We used a previously described minigene vector, and transfected HEK293 and/or Hela cells with wildtype and variant constructs. For 32 variants also results from patient RNA analyses were available, either performed by our laboratory or presented in literature.

Among young (<50 years) Indigenous women living in remote Aborigi nal communities in Arnhem Land, however, the incidence of this malignancy is more than 70 times the national Australian rate for the same age group. Previously, we found that neither excess human papillomavirus (HPV) inci dence nor a particularly virulent strain of HPV could explain the very high incidence of vulvar cancer in this population. Reports from the Gynaecology Outreach Service that cases appeared to cluster in family groups suggested that a genetic susceptibility, either to the effects of HPV or another cause of vulvar cancer, may be involved in this cluster.

The F ratios for two variables (LEF1 strong and LEF1 weak) indicated that dif ferences between astrocytomas (II, III) and glioblastomas were statistically significant (p<0.02).Allelic losses of APC gene were frequent with glioblastomas showing 60% and diffuse astocytomas (grade II) 20%. Allelic losses of AXIN1 were found in 10% of glioblastomas. In 31% of glioblastomas and 22% of astrocytomas downregulation of axin proteins was detected. In 31% of glioblastomas axin was localized in the nucleus.

21852,"The transcriptional coactivator YAP1 is a critical effector of the human Sal vador Warts Hippo pathway. Literature data report apparently discrepant results on the carcinogenic role of YAP1, which acts as oncogene or tumor suppressor in different in vitro and in vivo models. Furthermore, amplifica tion events of 11q22 locus encompassing YAP1 gene have been detected in multiple tumor types but there is limited direct evidence about the oncoge nic role of endogenous YAP1 within in the amplicon. We screened a panel of human tumor samples and cancer cell lines and identified that the YAP1 amplification event is actually present in up to 23% of the cases. We exploited EKVX, CaSki and RO82 cell lines harboring both genomic YAP1 amplification and YAP1 protein overexpression, in order to study the effects of downregulation of endogenous YAP1 by RNA interfe rence strategies. Gene expression profiling data identified 707 statistically significantly modulated genes (p value ,0.002) that were functionally an notated for cell proliferation and cellular movement ontologies.

21853,"The majority of women who are true non carriers of the BRCA1/2 familial mutation may be reassured that they are no longer considered at high risk for breast and ovarian cancer. For this reason, most should be encouraged to adopt the same cancer screening practices as those recommended to wo men of the same age in the general population. The aim of this study is to compare the rate of bilateral mammographies after BRCA1/2 testing to that prior among true non carriers of BRCA1/2 mutation. Information from the Quebec Health Insurance Board was used to identify all registered bilateral mammographies done between May 1, 1998 and March 31, 2012 among a cohort of 143 French Canadian unaffected true non carriers. The Cox pro portional hazards model for repeated events, with womenÃ¢ÂÂs age as the time scale, was used to obtain hazard ratios of bilateral mammographies. The rate of mammographies did not change after BRCA1/2 testing, neither glo bally (HR,0.93, p,0.22), nor by age (<50 years HR,0.81, p,0.13; Ã¢ÂÂ¥50 years HR,1.01, p,0.84). Although women <50 years had a lower rate of mam mographies than women Ã¢ÂÂ¥50 years (HR,0.55; 95% CI , 0.43 0.70) after genetic testing, 74% still continued to be screened, which is not generally recommended to women of the same age group in the general population. In conclusion, genetic testing information did not have a significant effect on mammography screening in our cohort of true non carriers of BRCA1/2 mutation. Clear cut recommendations for the follow up of true non carriers of BRCA1/2 mutation are needed.",2014

21855,"We have previously shown that the C1orf24 gene is highly expressed in follicular thyroid carcinomas while is not expressed in benign thyroid le sions. However, little is known about the molecular mechanism involved in C1orf24 expression. It is widely demonstrated that microRNAs (miRs) are potent regulators of gene expression. The miRs expression varies in accor ding of tissue, development stage, and tumor types. We therefore, investi gated whether miRs could modulate C1orf24 expression in thyroid cancer. In this study, we show that the miR 106b expression is lower in thyroid carcinomas, than in benign thyroid lesions (p<0,01). Functional analysis was performed in follicular thyroid carcinoma cell line (WRO), which highly express C1orf24 gene. The ectopic expression of miR106b into WRO resul ted in down regulation of C1orf24 at both mRNA and protein levels, when compared to negative control. Mutations made at miR 106 5p binding sites in the C1orf24 mRNA 3Ã¢ÂÂ UTR showed that miR 106b directly interacts with C1orf24. Additionally, miR 106b overexpression significantly decreased the migration capabilities of cells whilst increased apoptosis rate. Our findings indicate that miR 106 5p may play a role in thyroid carcinogenesis by ne gatively regulating C1orf24 expression and, therefore, by acting as tumor suppressor. However, further analyses are needed to fully demonstrate the role of miR 106b 5p in thyroid carcinogenesis. Financial Support: FAPESP (2012/02902 9) and CNPq (470441/2013 5)",2014

The aim of our study was to estima te copy number variation (CNV) of SOX2 in primary tumours and to analyse SOX2 expression in primary tumour tissue and in blood samples in relati on to CNV status in squamous cell lung cancer patients. 28 patients with metastatic squamous cell lung cancer were prospectively included between years 2010 and 2013. Total RNA was isolated from whole blood collected in PAXgene Blood RNA Tube before any systemic treatment. For 10 patients primary tumour tissue was available from the same time points; for those patients RNA and DNA were extracted from FFPE tumours. SOX2 expression levels and CNV status were determined by quantitative RT PCR. Copy num ber analysis revealed high copy number of SOX2 in 3/10 (30%) tumours and gain of function in another 3/10 (30%) tumours. Median SOX2 expression in FFPE tumour tissue was 3.9 (0.1 29.1) and in blood samples 5.4 (0.4 17.9). Elevated copy number of SOX2 correlated with higher SOX2 expression in tumours (ÃÂ,0.92). Moreover, correlation between SOX2 expression in blood samples and FFPE tumour tissue was observed (ÃÂ ,0.60); patients with high SOX2 expression in blood tended to have high SOX2 expression in tumour tissue.

Individuals with 22q11.2DS most often have a classically associated 3 MB or 1.5 MB deletion. However, nested deletions as well as atypical deletions also occur that can contribute to the broad spectrum of phenotypic abnormalities. It is also hypothesized that variations in the remaining allele could underly the phenotypic variability. To investigate variation within the non deleted allele we performed targe ted resequencing of the 22q11.2 region for 127 patients, identifying mul tiple deletion sizes, including two atypical deletions. We cataloged over 18 thousand hemizygous variant positions, of which sixty percent were pre viously annotated. As expected, in this gene dense region more variants were intronic (52%) than intergenic (36%). Within the coding regions we identified 213 non synonymous variants, 6 stop gains, and 5 frameshift in sertions. In addition, the observed number of variants per gene was higher or lower than expected for some genes in both our data and 1000 genomes data, indicating some genes may tolerate variation more or less than others. This extensive catalog of hemizygous varaints will serve as a blueprint for future experiments to correlate 22q11DS variation with phenotype and serve as an analysis model as we extend to whole genome sequencing of 22q11DS patients.",2014

Alpha1 antitrypsin (AAT) deficiency is a common hereditary disorder asso ciated with reduced AAT serum level, predisposing to pulmonary emphyse ma or liver disease. It is caused by inheritance of mutations in the AAT gene (SERPINA1). Most of the deficiency alleles occur in the coding sequence of the gene due to aminoacid substitution or deletion resulting in reduced pro tein level or altered functionality. Rarely mutations affecting RNA splicing in the AAT gene have been described so far. We have identified a new null allele, QOmadrid in two siblings with signi ficantly reduced serum levels of AAT . QOmadrid allele results from a du plication of a timine in the position +2 of the donor splice site of exon 1C (+2dupT). In these patients QOmadrid occurred in combination with ano ther previously described rare null variant, QOporto. These two variants correspond to splicing mutations in a regulatory region of the gene, both causing disruption of the normal splicing of intron 1C. Analysis of tran scripts in patientsÃ¢ÂÂ samples and in vitro assays using minigenes revealed abnormal splicing leading to absence of transcription from exon 1C, where the hepatocytes transcription start site is located. Thus, in these patients no normally spliced RNA products are expected to be produced in the liver, causing the AAT deficiency. This mutation constitutes a new null allele, QO madrid, contributing to explain the disease.",2014
21861,"The endocannabinoid system (ECS) plays a crucial role in the regulation of a variety of physiological functions, such as learning and memory proces sing, vegetative control, energy homeostasis, immunity and stress response. It acts through different endogenous endocannabinoids which are able to bind to the cannabinoid receptor subtypes 1 and 2 (CNR1 and CNR2). The CNR1 is not only associated with phenotypes such as cognitive perfor mance, addiction and anxiety, but is also known to be crucially involved in cellular responses to acute and chronic stress conditions. The molecular me chanisms leading to altered CNR1 expression under acute or chronic stress exposure are not completely understood so far. It is known that the 5Ã¢ÂÂ and 3Ã¢ÂÂuntranslated regions (UTRs) of genes can harbor regulatory elements, such as upstream open reading frames (uORFs) that are capable of influen cing the expression pattern of the main protein coding region. In our study, we investigated the influence of putatively functional uORFs present in the five known mRNA variants of the human CNR1 gene on tran scription and translation under baseline conditions and various stress con ditions in vitro. The functional analysis performed with reporter gene assay and quantitative realtime PCR revealed that two of these variants contain upstream open reading frames that modulate gene expression both under baseline condition and conditions of cellular stress. Thus our findings sug gest that the functionally relevant uORFs found in the 5Ã¢ÂÂUTR variants of CNR1 are part of the cellular stress response mechanisms.",2014

As cases 2 and 5 are mosaic with a normal cell line, they should have been origina ted postzygotically. A dynamic mosaicism was present in all the cases. All the rings were originated by breaks on both arms with loss of subtelomeric material and subsequent reunion of free ends with the exception of cases 2 and 5.

21864,"Chromothripsis (CTH) is a newly described phenomenon of chromosome shattering where multiple localized breakpoints result in catastrophic geno mic rearrangements.

In this study we pre sent a familial G CTH with 7 breakpoints and a deletion, stably segregating in three generations (10 individuals) without an apparent association with a disorder. Initial cytogenetic analysis suggested an apparently balanced translocation t(3;5)(q22.3;q23.1). Using chromosome array and next gene ration mate pair sequencing followed by Sanger sequencing we discovered a G CTH involving six breakpoints and a ~108kb deletion within a ~6,4Mb re gion on 3q22.3 q23.

The der(7) nine breakpoints and der(11) four breakpoints are, respectively, within 10.9Mb (7q33 q35) and 11.2Mb (11p14.1 p12) segments. Considering the breakpoint clustering and chromosome reorganization, we speculate that chromothripsis under lies this CCR formation. Twelve germline chromothripsis were previously reported, most of them balanced (Kloosterman et al. Curr Opin Cell Biol 2013;25:341). Our case illustrates that localized shattering of chromoso mes and assembly of resulting fragments, signature of chromothripsis, may result in several fragment losses. Therefore the balanced state of most germ line cases might not be a feature of constitutional chromothripsis, but reflect embryonic viability. Among the deleted/disrupted genes likely contributing to the patientÃ¢ÂÂs clinical features are PAX6 explaining aniridia, and CNTNAP2, implicated in neurodevelopment, and particularly language abilities.

In the first reexamination of unselected de novo BCRs (BCRdn) detected by 40 years of prenatal diagnosis in Denmark, we have shown that BCRs truncate protein coding genes, ncRNA genes, unannotated transcripts detected by deep sequencing, as well as developmental regula tory genomic landscapes, mimicing random mutagenesis. In addition, our study revealed a ~20% long term disease risk of unselected BCRdn, 2 3 fold higher than previously assumed, suggesting that a genotype phenotype re lationship can be obtained for a significant number of the human genes by mapping of BCRs.

The molecular mechanism underlying most Guanine to Adenine substitutions is deamination of Cytosine to Uracil and the subsequent replacement of the complementary Guanine for an Ade nine during DNA replication. However, recurring disease mutations in to tally independent individuals at the same position within the gene suggests a shared mutation mechanism. By the systematic analysis of known DNA mutation mechanisms such as gene conversion, homologous recombination and DNA replication faults involving loop formation one may get insight in more general disease causing mutation mechanisms and find an explanati on for recurrent mutations. This may have implications for counseling when hotspots are predictable based on knowledge about mechanisms leading to disease causing mutations.",2014
21870,"Background: Cystic Fibrosis (CF) is an autosomal recessive severe genetic disease. Mutations on CFTR (Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane conductance Regulator) gene could induce CF or CFTR RD (related disorder). A missense mutation detected in a Brittany family (c.965T>C or p. Val322Ala) was stu died since this mutation is present in a family owning a risk ÃÂ¼ to have a child carrying this mutation and another severe mutation in trans (p. Phe508del). To provide a wise genetic counseling to this family, in silico and biological studies of the impact of the p. Val322Ala on CFTR protein were realized. Aim: This mutation was studied to elucidate its impact on CFTR process in cellulo (maturation and localization), and in silico (protein structure) as the prediction of the severity of this mutation is evaluated as Ã¢ÂÂhighÃ¢ÂÂ by Poly phen 2. Methods: pTCF plasmids containing CFTR WT , or CFTR p. Phe508 del, or CFTR p. Val322Ala are transfected in eukaryotic cells for western blot and confocal microscopy. Polyphen 2 and swiss prot were used to in silico studies. Results: The p. Val322Ala leads to a normal processing and correct membrane localization. Both mutated protein and the WT CFTR structures are similar, suggesting that this mutation is a mild mutation. Conclusions: These results emphasise the importance of molecular studies in elucidating the impact of mutations on clinical phenotypes and therapeutic strategies.

Ka ryotype and karyogram profiles of patients with RPLs are presented in cur rent results. A total of 722 patients; 161(44.5%) infertile and 200(55.5%) RPL couples were included in the study. Karyotype and structural chromosome analyses of both patient groups in Canakkale population were made between May 2011 December 2013, using peripheral lymphocyte cell culture and GTG banding technique. High frequency of chromosomal abnormalities(%7.45) were detected in 24 patients of the infertility group(n:322). 10 patients(42%) of this group(n:24) had numerical and 14 patients(58%) had balanced structural choromosomal abnormalities. A novel choromosomal insertion was found in an infertile male, one of the 22th choromosome was totally inserted in 9th choromosome [ins(9;22)(9pter q12::22q11.1 q13.33::9q12 9qter)]. This is the first report of germline total inserion of a chromosome. Interestingly, this insertion was inherited from father. Balanced structural chromosomal abnormalities was also detected in 17 patients (4.25%) of RPL group wit hout any numerical abnormalities.

21872,"Structural aberrations make a significant contribution to genetic disease. Balanced or unbalanced structural abnormalities may be inherited from a carrier parent or may occur as de novo rearrangements. When the abnor mality occurs as a de novo event, the risk for genetic disease or phenotypic effects is increased, even when the rearrangement appears balanced. This may result from either submicroscopic deletions or duplications at the bre akpoints. We report three cases with structural chromosomal abnormalities that were detected using a combination of different techniques. Conventional karyo type revealed the presence of de novo chromosomal rearrangements in all three cases. The investigation continued with targeted array CGH (Compa rative Genomic Hybridization) technique, using BAC (Bacterial Artificial Chromosome) clones for the identification of chromosome imbalances. Sin ce the results obtained using cytogenetic analysis and targeted array CGH revealed the implication of terminal regions of abnormal chromosomes, we also applied MLPA (Multiplex ligation dependent probe amplification) for subtelomeric regions, as an additional detection technique. In two cases ad ditional information regarding the chromosome constitution was provided by MLPA. Knowing the advantages and limits of each technique, complementary in vestigations were necessary to detect the architecture of chromosomal im balances. Further investigations for a specific case, although it means additional costs, are required by a low genotype phenotype correlation. Any discrepancy between the clinical picture and the results of genetic testing imposes sup plementary tests for an accurate diagnosis and a proper genetic counseling.",2014

An 8 year old girl presented with intellec tual disability, autistic features, microcephaly, large upper incisors, small lower jaw, hypertrichosis, and pectus excavatum. Cytogenetic analysis has indicated the presence of a deletion at the short arm of chromosome 8 in about 60% of cells. SNP/oligonucleotide CGH has confirmed the presence of mosaic terminal deletion at 8p21.3p23.1 spanning about 11.152 Mb af fecting 178 genes. Molecular cytogenetic analysis showed that 48% of cells are affected by this deletion. Clinically, the index case resembles non mo saic deletions of 8p23. Nevertheless, milder manifestations of intellectual disability, microcephaly and facial dismorphisms were noticed, whereas autistic features were found to be more prominent. Interestingly, genomic loci flanking the breakpoint of mosaic deletion were regularly deleted. The regular deletion spanned three olfactory receptor (OR) genes (OR7E158P , OR7E161P , OR7E160P) and three beta defensin (DEFB) genes (DEFB137, DEFB136, DEFB134). Since OR gene clusters are known to be involved in generation of 8p chromosome rearrangements, we have hypothesized that at least in the present case DEFB gene cluster is also involved in chromoso me abnormality formation. Finally, to our knowledge this is the first case of a mosaic 8p deletion addressed by SNP/oligonucleotide CGH and mediated by OR gene recombination.

We analyzed a girl with moderate learning disabilities, delayed language development, craniofacial features and skin anomalies reminiscent of NS. After a mutation screening of the known NS genes PTPN11, SOS1, RAF1, KRAS, GRB2, BRAF and SHOC2 we found the heterozygous c.755T/C variation in SOS1 causing the I252T substitution, which was considered possibly pathogenetic by bio informatic predictions. The same mutation was present in the probandÃ¢ÂÂs mother and maternal grandfather, both displaying some NS features, but also by a healthy subject on 1000 genomes analyzed. The functional ana lysis revealed that the SOS1 c.755T/C activated the Ras effector Erk1, con firming the predicted pathogenetic substitution. To explain the incomplete penetrance of the reported mutation we hypothesized that SOS1 may be subjected to a differential allelic expression (DAE). Interestingly, after se quencing the cDNA from peripheral blood compared to genomic DNA, we showed a DAE of some known SOS1 SNSs in healthy individuals and obser ved the mutated allele C 50% more expressed than the normal allele T in all our NS familial carriers. The similar level of SOS1 mRNA, between mutated and control individuals, suggests that the mutation here described does not affect SOS1 expression. We are now evaluating the SOS1 promoter polymor phisms. This study, providing the first evidence of allelic imbalance of SOS1, pinpoint DAE as a possible mechanism underlying a different penetrance of some SOS1 mutated alleles in unrelated carriers.",2014

21876,"Trisomy 9p is one of the most common partial trisomies found in newborn, possibly because this region is relatively poor in genes resulting in a high survival rate. We report four different chromosome rearrangements resul ting in complete 9p duplication, three of them involving 9p centromere al terations. The rearrangements in the patients were characterized by G ban ding, SNP array and FISH (Fluorescent in situ Hybridization) with different probes. One presents 9p duplication concomitant to 18p deletion due to an inherited der(18)t(9;18)(p11.2;p11.31)mat. Two patients present de novo dicentric chromosomes: der(9;15)t(9;15)(p11.2;p13) and der(9;21)t(9;21)(p13.1;p13.1), respectively. Another patient presents two rearranged chro mosomes: a der(12)t(9;12)(q21.13;p13.33) and concomitant i(9)(p10) which showed a FISH centromeric signal smaller than its homologous. Besi des the duplication 9p24.3p13.1, array revealed deletion in 9q13q21.13 (7.3 Mb). This rearrangement may have been originated by a misdivision centric fission resulting in a smaller centromere in i(9p) and part of the 9q long arm being translocated to the distal 12p. The deletion 9q may have been caused during the rearrangement with the chromosome 12. The chromoso me 9 is rich in segmental duplications, especially in pericentromeric region, with high degree of sequence identity to sequences in 15p, 18p and 21p, chromosomes involved in our rearrangements. In two patients the dicentric chromosomes formed may have been converted into stable functional mo nocentric chromosomes by epigenetic centromere inactivation followed by heterochromatinization. Thus, we suggest that chromosome 9 is prone to illegal recombination, either intra or interchromosomal, that predispose it to rearrangements, frequently involving pericentromeric regions (Financial support FAPESP , Brazil).",2014
21877,"Heterochromatin rearrangements are believed to be clinically insignificant variants of the human karyotype. However, several authors have studied the possible association of heterochromatin variants with certain clinical diagnoses, especially with reproduction failure. Variants of heterochroma tin area of chromosome 9 are the most common. They involve enlargement (qh+) or shortening (qh ) of the heterochromatin block as well as the peri centric inversion inv(9)(p12q13). More complex variants of this area may include duplication and/or combination of above mentioned rearrange ments. Distinguishing between benign and pathological rearrangement in this area can be challenging. The classical G and/or C banding are not very specific and array methods like SNP array/array CGH are usually not able to ana lyse precisely this pericentric region, which is composed mainly of satellite DNA. For enhanced analysis of heterochromatin area of chromosome 9 we imple mented a special molecular cytogenetic method using three different FISH probes centromeric alpha satellite, centromeric III DNA satellite and a specific BAC probe (hybridizing on 9p12 and 9q13 homologous sequences). The outcomes of this examination in 20 patients with different clinical indi cations are demonstrated. Although believed to be benign, the heterochomatin variants of chromoso me 9 have been repeatedly mentioned as potentially associated with repro duction failure. Since the majority of these variants are undoubtedly truly benign, presented molecular cytogenetic examination is able to analyse this region more precisely than standard banding methods and distinguish among different (sub)variants of chromosome 9 much better than karyoty ping and point out these potentially harmful.

Here we present the clinical and cytogenetic findings in a 1 year old female referred for genetic evaluation because of dysmorphic features, including hypotonia, umbilical hernia, hypertelorism, broad nasal bridge, microretrognathia, low set ears, and wide spaced nipples. Cytogenetic examination of GTG banded metaphases showed a female karyotype with mosaicism of an sSMC. Ad ditional molecular cytogenetics analysis (cenM FISH and subcenM FISH) characterized the sSMC to be derived from chromosome 5 including hetero chromatic and euchromatic material. The shape of sSMC was not clearly to define; either it is a ring or centric minute.

The role of CGGBP1 on FMR1 transcription is yet to be defined. Sequencing analysis and expression studies through quantitative PCR of CGGBP1 were performed in cell lines with different allele expansions (wild type WT , premutation, me thylated full mutations FXS and unmethylated full mutation UFM), demon strating no differences between them. ChIP assays showed that CGGBP1 binds unmethylated CGG triplets of the FMR1 gene proportionally to the length of the repeats. We also observed that CGGBP1 binding to the FMR1 lo cus was restored after pharmacological demethylation with 5 azadC of FXS alleles, suggesting a possible role for CGGBP1 in FMR1 expression. CGGBP1 silencing with siRNA (reaching ~ 85% of CGGBP1 mRNA depletion) did not affect FMR1 transcription in WT and UFM fibroblasts.

An updated database reports 186 different G6PD mutations. Many of the se are polymorphic in various populations; many are sporadic, having been discovered because they cause chronic non spherocytic haemolytic anemia (CNSHA) associated with severe enzyme deficiency (WHO class I).A little boy with a history of neonatal jaundice treated with phototherapy, and of anemia (Hb 80 90 G/L) during his first semester, was seen at age 3.4 years. He is clinically well, with no significant physical findings; Hb 110 G/L, MCV 95, MCH 31, MCHC 33, reticulocytes 271x109/L, bilirubin 22 ÃÂµmol/L: indicating a well compensated haemolytic condition. G6PD activity was 0.89 IU/GHb (ref values 7 10 IU/GHb). Sequencing the G6PD gene revealed an A >G change in exon 7 at nucleotide 655, predicting an Arg >Gly change at codon 219. The mother was shown to be heterozygous for the same mutati on: her G6PD assay was normal. This mutation is not present in the database and therefore it is a new sporadic class I mutation. We interpret the CNSHA phenotype as related to the fact that Arg >Gly is a rather drastic amino acid change, since it entails a charge change as well as a steric change: such chan ges are likely to cause decreased stability of the G6PD protein and enzyme deficiency. It is interesting that Arg219 is not a conserved residue: we have previously reported that in terms of clinical phenotype the consequences in such cases would not be so drastic, and this may explain why this child does have haemolysis but only mild anemia.",2014

This gene dosage technique allowed for the detection of exon 1 duplication of the F8 gene in three apparently unrelated subjects. Using array comparative genomic hybridization, breakpoint analysis deli mited the duplication extent to 210 kb in the F8 gene intron 1 and in the VBP1 gene intragenic position. We postulated that the rearrangement re sponsible for this duplication could have arisen due to symmetrical tandem inversion duplication resulting in resulting in a large rearrangement of F8 gene intron 1 of 233 kb. This intron revised should allow the production of small number of normal mRNA transcripts in relation with mild HA phe notype. Indeed, the F8 gene mRNA from Patient 1 unexpectedly exhibited normal amplification of the segment containing exons 1 to 9 and reduced cross reacting material (CRM), compatible with the patientÃ¢ÂÂs mild disease severity. All patients displayed an identical F8 haplotype, despite not being related, which suggests a possible founder effect of a 210 kb large duplicati on involving the F8 gene exon 1.The present study will need to be confirmed on a larger cohort of same ge netic origin/background to evaluate for prevalence of the duplication as a cause genotype in mild HA patients.",2014
21882,"Abnormal CNVs are frequently found in subtelomeres of patients with intel lectual disabilities (ID) and congenital anomalies (CA). The subtelomeric re arrangements do not usually present recurrent breakpoints (BPs) and involve several different chromosomes ends. Although these regions encompass ap proximately 30% of pathogenic CNVs, the causes of subtelomeric breakages and repair have not yet been investigated comprehensively. We investigated 105 unrelated patients with ID/CA using MLPA, FISH and arrays (BeadChip Illumina/CGH array Agilent) in order to characterize the subtelomeric BP . Within the set of subtelomeric rearrangement studied, the deleted regions ranged from 137 kb to 29 Mb, and the duplicated regions from 155 kb to 32 Mb. We identified 38 BPs, from 19 different regions. Our analysis showed repetitive elements in 31 BPs encompassing SINEs (Alu; MIR), LINEs (L1; L2), and LTRs. We also found six BPs presenting simple tandem repeats and two BPs with interstitial telomeric sequences (ITs). Rearrangements with exclusively deletions are suggested to be caused by non homologous end joining (NHEJ) or microhomology mediated end joining (MMEJ) mechanis ms. Complex rearrangements are likely caused by fork stalling and template switching (FoSTeS) or microhomology mediated break induced replication (MMBIR). Misalignments during replication due the repetitive sequences in these loci can lead to MMBIR and generate the complex dup/del rearran gements observed in 7 of our patients. Furthermore, genomic architectural features, like sequence motifs, non B DNA conformations, and repetitive ele ments may increase the susceptibility for DNA breakage or promote FoSTeS in these regions. Mapping subtelomeric BPs should help to clarify the muta tional mechanisms involved in these genomic rearrangements.",2014

In glioma we pointed out an imbalance between MARK4 isoforms, proportional to cellular de differentiation and tumor grade. This imbalance ABSTRACTS POSTERS ESHG 2014 | MILAN, ITALY | WWW. ESHG. ORG 273Back to inde x is triggered by decreased expression of MARK4S, the canonical isoform, as sociated with overexpression of MARK4L, the alternative isoform with skip ping of exon 16. Having ruled out mutations, CNVs and transcription defects as cause of de regulated MARK4 expression, we searched alterations in alternative splicing at the origin of the observed isoforms imbalance. Bioinformatic analysis of MARK4 genomic sequence revealed three bin ding sites for the splicing factor PTB in introns flanking MARK4 alternative exon 16. A functional role for these sites is suggested by the conservation in mouse and the surrounding polypyrimidine rich context. Since in glioma PTB overexpression drives an oncogenic splicing switch favoring exon skipped isoforms, we performed Western blot on glioma and glioblastoma derived cancer stem cell samples and found a significant overexpression of PTB, correlating with MARK4L expression. Splicing assay of the designed and differently deleted minigenes revealed that IVS15 contains a functional intronic splicing silencer (ISS). However, mutagenesis of the PTB binding site in this region does not affect minigene splicing, suggesting PTB binds to a non canonical ISS. Electrophoretic mobility shift coupled to mass spectro metry confirmed the PTB binding to MARK4 IVS15 and its involvement in MARK4 alternative splicing. Alternative splicing thus emerges as an oncogenic mechanism that through the PTB mediated regulation of MARK4 isoforms expression fosters prolife ration and de differentiation in glioma.",2014

Therefore it is believed that cancer cells might arise from stem cells possessing self renewal capabilities. Mi croRNAs (miRs) are small RNA molecules that act regulating gene expressi on post transcriptionally by targeting hundreds of mRNAs simultaneously. With this in mind, we hypothesized that significant changes in the cell cycle could be a good indicator for miRs capable of regulating normal and oncoge nic proliferation. To test this hypothesis, 2.000 BJ foreskin fibroblasts were transfected with 50nM of 28 microRNAs mimics (pre miR) and inhibitors (anti miR) in 96 well microplates. After 5 days, proliferation was measured by XTT assay. Cell cycle classification (EdU assay) and viability (Sytox Green staining) following miR transfection were performed in a High Content Screening platform.

The study set was divided into 4 groups, each containing 10 young Balb/c mice. Group 1 mice were exposed to H/R. Group 2 and group 3 mice were pre treated with IGF 1 and EPO for 7 days respectively before H/R. Group 4 served as a control group. Intestinal injury was evaluated by histological scoring.

IGF 1 and EPO treated animals showed decreased histological damage and decreased apoptosis which was confirmed by TUNEL test and caspase 3 ac tivity. Telomerase activity increased in these groups in addition to increased expression of anti apoptotic genes (p< 0.01). However pro apoptotic gene expressions were not statistically different (p>0.05).

Lectin like oxidized low density lipoprotein receptor 1 (LOX 1), encoded by OLR1 gene, is the major endothelial ox LDL receptor and plays a role in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis and tumorigenesis. OLR1 is subjected to a physiological alternative splicing. Two different isoforms are known: Loxin (NM_001172633.1) lacks exon 5 and encodes for a putative truncated receptor (LOXIN) with impaired binding activity; OLR1D4 (NM_001172632.1) lacks exon 4 and the putative protein has a dif ferent C terminus domain. Functional role of OLR1D4 is unknown, while LO XIN is a natural inhibitor of LOX 1 mediated signalling and its up regulation may have a potential therapeutic effect. We transfected HeLa cells with minigenes (HIGH/LOW risk) carrying two different haplotypes of the six SNPs regulating OLR1/Loxin splicing. A dose curve PMA treatment shows that 10nM PMA at 3h up regulates Loxin ex pression (FC10nM,+1.6, p<0.05) in HeLa transfected with H risk haplotype (Hela H). Loxin increase was not followed by OLR1 up regulation and the OLR1/Loxin ratio after 10 nM of PMA was lowered to 28.1% than HeLa H. These results suggest a role of PMA in modulating OLR1 splicing in vitro, leading to an increase of Loxin isoform. Moreover, we performed a compu tational analysis from different databases (TargetScan, miRanda, Pita) that predicted two microRNAs that bind the 3Ã¢ÂÂ²UTR of OLR1 gene in nucleotide region in which are located SNPs.

21888,"Phenylketonuria (PKU) is rare metabolic disease caused by mutations in phenylalanine hydroxylase gene (PAH). Mutations that abolish structure and function of PAH are main determinant of PKU phenotype. However, phe notype couldnÃ¢ÂÂt be always predicted precisely. Previously, we found a tran scription enhancer in PAH intron 8 that could affect genotype phenotype correlation. In this study, we functionally analyzed additional non coding PAH gene alterations to propose new transcription regulatory elements. In silico prediction for transcription factor binding sites pointed to a popula tion specific promoter alteration (PAH: c. 170delC) and VNTR alterations in 3Ã¢ÂÂ region, that have never been analyzed before. We transiently transfected HepG2 cell line with various CAT reporter constructs to determine the effect of a PAH gene non coding sequences on transcription. We found that a con struct with additional binding site in promoter and constructs with VNTR3, VNTR7 and VNTR8 alterations had a 50 60% reduction of CAT activity in comparison to pBLCAT5. EMSA supershift showed binding of KLF1 tran scription factor to the analyzed promoter sequence, while the full structure of VNTR3 was needed to obtain binding of C/EBPalfa. Our study pointed to two new elements in promoter and 3Ã¢ÂÂ region of PAH gene that could act as transcription silencers and thus influence genotype based prediction of PKU severity. Given that these non coding alterations are population specific, further validation of their relevance should be stu died in different populations. New transcription regulators in non coding regions, like these ones, will contribute to better understanding of PKU phenotype complexity and may become important for optimization of PKU treatment.",2014
21889,"Chromothripsis is a phenomenon of genomic rearrangement arising during a single genome shattering event resulting in multiple chromosome breaks involving one or more chromosomes, followed by imprecise reassembly. We report a case of a 21 month old female presenting with global developmen tal delay, hypotonia, minor dysmorphic features, nystagmus and multiple ca fÃÂ© au lait spots. Array CGH analysis identified a 1.15 Mb interstitial deletion within chromosome 11p11.2 that partially overlaps the proximal interval of the Potocki Schaffer syndrome (PSS) critical region. This deletion does not overlap the EXT2 and ALX4 genes which are associated with the mul tiple exostoses and parietal foramina phenotypes, respectively, frequently observed in individuals with this syndrome. This deletion does, however, overlap a 137 kb region previously identified as the critical region suffici ent to cause hypotonia in PSS. Furthermore, haploinsufficiency of PHF21A, which is deleted in this patient, has been implicated in the intellectual disa bility and craniofacial anomalies associated with PSS. Chromosome and FISH analyses revealed an unanticipated de novo complex rearrangement involving chromosomes 9, 10 and 11 with at least 8 chromosome breaks: 46,XX,der(9)(10qter >10q24.3::11p11.2 >11p13::9p23 >9qter),der(10) (10pter >10q24.3::11p13 >11p14::9p23 >9p24::11p14 >11pter),der(11)(9pter >9p24::11q13.5 >11p11.22::11q13.5 >11qter)dn. Although the de letion within chromosome 11p11.22 was the only clinically significant copy number imbalance, it is unclear if the other chromosome breaks and possib le gene disruptions contribute to the patientÃ¢ÂÂs phenotype. Similar to other reported instances of apparent germline chromothripsis, this case showed minimal DNA loss presumably reflecting a selection against massive copy number imbalances. This case highlights the importance of performing both array CGH and conventional cytogenetic methods as either investigation alone would have provided partial information.",2014
21890,"At 11+5 weeks of pregnancy, chorionic villus sampling was performed with referral reason Ã¢ÂÂDNA analysis for sickle cell anaemiaÃ¢ÂÂ. The HbS mutation was not identified. As is standard in our laboratory a rapid test for aneuploidy detection, quantitative fluorescence (QF) PCR. was performed. The QF PCR pattern of multiple X/Y specific markers was consistent with the presence of two X chromosomes, as well as Y specific sequence (SRY). This suggested that the fetus could have a XX male genotype. FISH showed that SRY was located on the derivative X chromosome. Additional karyotyping (46, XX.ish der(X) t(X; Y)(p22.3;p11.2)(SRY+)) confirmed the presence of a 46,XX, SRY+ disorder of sexual development. After karyotyping and FISH analysis of both parents, the abberation turned out to be de novo. Thus, additional aneuplo idy testing resulted in an unexpected finding which complicated the prena tal counselling. Approximately 1 in 20,000 individuals with a male appearance have a 46,XX testicular disorder. The SRY gene, normally located on the Y chromosome, provides instructions for making the sex determining region Y protein, which causes a fetus to develop as a male. Ultrasound at 18 weeks of ge station and postnatal inspection and ultrasound showed normal male geni talia. There were no signs of ambiguous genitalia. Parents felt confused by knowing prenatally that their unborn male child will be infertile, because of absence of the Y chromosomal AZF regions.

21891,"O. C. Genetica Medica, Istituto G. Gaslini, Genova, Italy. Control of mRNA half life plays a central role in normal development and disease. mRNA stability depends not only on cis acting sequences, but also on trans acting elements able to promote mRNA degradation. Though the RET gene is the major known gene involved in Hirschsprung di sease (HSCR), a congenital defect of gut innervation, and in Medullary Thy roid Carcinoma (MTC), its role in these disorders has not fully been explored yet. To this end, we sought to characterize molecular events leading to post transcriptional regulation and to identify genetic variants of RET 3Ã¢ÂÂUTR predisposing to HSCR and MTC development. Starting from a large set of DNA samples from patients affected with either HSCR or sporadic MTC, we focused on RET variants lying in candidate regulatory regions or miRNAs target sequences of the distal gene portion. To this end, a next generation se quencing approach for the whole RET gene has been undertaken. Alleles of variants located in proximity of Poly Adenylation cleavage sites and putative regulatory elements have turned out differently distributed among HSCR, MTC and control samples. Moreover, linkage disequilibrium is apparently stronger in cases than in controls, thus further suggesting that functional ABSTRACTS POSTERS ESHG 2014 | MILAN, ITALY | WWW. ESHG.

Furthermore, to identify AU rich regions, microRNAs and bin ding factors involved in the post transcriptional control, the RET 3Ã¢ÂÂUTR was fragmented in three parts and cloned into a luciferase vector. Preliminary results show different effects on mRNA stability for these fragments both in RET positive and RET negative cell lines.",2014
21892,"Ring 17 syndrome is a rare disorder and only 19 cases have been reported so far. Severity of the associated phenotype is influenced by the presence or deletion of the Miller Dieker critical region (MDCR) with presence of the MDCR being associated with milder phenotypes, including growth delay , in tellectual disability, epilepsy, cafÃÂ© au lait skin spots and minor facial dysmor phism. We report a patient born at 41 gestation weeks after an uneventful pregnancy, with normal birth parameters weight : 3kg350, length : 49 cm . The Initial psychomotor development was normal. When he was 3 years old the patient developed fronto parietal epilepsy. Cytogenetic investigations from peripheral blood cells showed a mosaic ring chromosome 17 karyoty pe :mos 46,XY,r(17)(p13;q25)[42]/45,XY, 17[5]/46,XY[3]. At 6 years of age, he had generalised epilepsy, developmental delay, school difficulties, and at tention deficit disorder. Clinical examination showed no facial dysmorphism and no growth delay. Skin changes showed sparse cafÃÂ© au lait spots but no axillary or inguinal freckling, and 2 small achromic spots. Cerebral MRI, cardiac ultrasound and ophtalmological fundus were normal. Molecular cy togenetic investigations confirmed that no terminal deletion had occurred, and an array CGH ( Agilent 44K) did not detect any submicroscopic deletion or duplication.

21893,"Classically, common pathogenic somatic genome variations are attributed to mosaic aneuploidy or polyploidy. However, recent reports on somatic mo saicism have demonstrated that mosaic structural genomic rearrangements (chromosome abnormalities) are likely to underlie intellectual disability, congenital malformations and autism as low level mosaic aneuploidy does. To get further insight into possible role of somatic structural genome varia tions in disease, we have analyzed 202 patients with intellectual disability, congenital malformations and autism using SNP/oligonucleotide array CGH (two array CGH platforms with a resolution of 1 and 15 kb). Low level mo saic aneuploidy (additional chromosome Y in about 5% of cells) was found in 2 cases (1%). Mosaic structural genomic rearrangements associated with a phenotypic outcome (according to an original bioinformatic technolo gy) were detected in 14 cases (6.9%). These were mosaic duplications at 1q21.1q21.2 (1.9Mb), 11p15.5 (1.3Mb), 11p14.3 (8.4Mb) and mosaic deleti ons at 1p36.33p36.23 (7Mb), 2q22.1q23.3 (10.2Mb), 2q23.3q24.2 (10.7Mb), 5q14.3q15 (6.3Mb), 7q35q36.3 (14.6Mb), 8p23.3p23.1 (11.1Mb), 11q23.3 (0.1Mb), 21q11.1q21.2 (11.4Mb) and Xq28 (MECP2) (0.09Mb). Moreover, two cases have demonstrated low level mosaicsim for isochromosome 12p and small supernumerary chromosome, which represented min(17)(:p11.2 >q11.1:) (8Mb). These rearrangements were further confirmed by FISH and/or multicolor banding. Additionally, two benign mosaic subchro mosomal aberrations (deletion at 14q11.2 in 7 cases; duplication at Xq28 in 2 cases) were observed. To our knowledge, such somatic genome variations (recurrent and benign) were not reported. Our data evidence that somatic genome variations manifesting as structural rearrangements are relatively common among children with intellectual disability, congenital malformati ons and autism.

21894,"Sequence changes in exons can alter pre mRNA splicing either by changing splice sites or by modifying exonic splicing regulatory elements (ESR). The effects on ESR are especially difficult to predict by using currently available bioinformatics tools. Here, we used as a model system the exon 18 of BR CA2 gene involved in breast ovarian cancer predisposition, and tested the impact on splicing of 36 variants identified in patients or reported in public databases. By using a splicing minigene assay, we found that 13 (7 missense, 4 synonymous, 1 nonsense and 1 in frame deletion variants) out of these 36 variations induce an increase in exon 18 skipping, by potentially modifying ESR. When patient blood RNA was available (n,4), the effects of the vari ants were confirmed. Recently, we demonstrated the predictive value of ESR hexamersÃ¢ÂÂ scores established by Ke et al. (2011) in identifying splicing re gulatory mutations within BRCA2 exon 7 (Di Giacomo et al, 2013). Here, we show that this approach is also able to predict the effect on splicing regulati on of BRCA2 exon 18 variants. Together with segregation data, these results should contribute to the classification of variants of unknown significance in BRCA2 exon 18. In addition, this study extends the validation of a new in silico tool for predicting the impact of exonic variants on ESR. This tool may have important applications in the filtering strategy allowing the discovery of pathogenic mutations among the large fraction of variants detected by high throughput sequencing.",2014
21895,"Epigenetic changes are generally based on the switching of alternative functional or structural states and result in the adaptation of cellular ex pression patterns during proliferation, differentiation or plastic changes in the adult organism, whereas some epigenetic information can be passed on other generations while other is not. Hence, the principal question is: why is some information reset or resolved during the meiosis process and other is passed from one generation to anohter, or, in other words: what Ã¢ÂÂadaptation triggerÃ¢ÂÂ level initiates transgenerationally transmitted epigenome change? Hereto, we propose a theory which states that stress, or, more specifically, the energy cost of an individualÃ¢ÂÂs adaptation to stress, represents a viable candidate for the transgenerational transmission trigger of a given acquired trait. It has been reported recently that the higher lifetime entropy gene ration of a unitÃ¢ÂÂs body mass, the higher the entropy stress level (which is a measure of energy released by a unitÃ¢ÂÂs organ mass where k , heat) and the irreversibility within the organ, resulting in faster organ degradation and consequent health problems for the entire biological system. We therefore suggest a new variable: Ã¢ÂÂstress entropic loadÃ¢ÂÂ actually reflec ting the energetic cost of an individualÃ¢ÂÂs adaptation that may be used to esti mate the probability of inducing transgenerational response and propose methods for its estimatio",2014
21896,"A 30 year old woman was a known carrier of a balanced translocation 46,XX, t(14;18)(q13;q12.2), ascertained prenatally 30 years ago, when her ABSTRACTS POSTERS ESHG 2014 | MILAN, ITALY | WWW. ESHG. ORG 276Back to inde x mother performed amniocentesis because of advanced maternal age. Karyo typing was confirmed by FISH five years ago. The woman with a known ba lanced translocation between chromosomal bands 14q13 and 18q12.2 was referred for prenatal diagnosis by amniocentesis at 17 weeks of gestation. Cytogenetic analysis of the fatherÃ¢ÂÂs lymphocytes showed a normal male ka ryotype 46,XY. Their first baby had normal karyotype 46,XX, also prenatal ly observed. We present the case of prenatally diagnosed tertiary trisomy with supernumerary derivative chromosome 14, due to a 3:1 segregation of maternal reciprocal translocation. The fetal karyotype was 47,XX,+der(14) t(14;18)(q13;q12.2)mat, resulting in partial trisomy 14(pter q13) and par tial trisomy 18 (q12.2 qter). There was no evidence of fetal malformations by ultrasound examination. After the amniocentesis procedure, amniotic fluid has leaked and the mother miscarried. In reciprocal translocation car riers these chromosomes can arise in different segregation modes, such as alternate, adjacent 1, adjacent 2, 3:1 or 4:0, resulting in the formation of 32 possible zygotes with different chromosome complements. This case sup ports the thesis that the incidence of 3:1 segregation is higher in female than in male carriers, more often occurs when one of the derivative chromoso mes is relatively small, and also suggests that translocation with acrocentric chromosomes tends to produced 3:1 segregation.",2014
21897,"Recently we discovered three independent cases of Ã¢ÂÂsevere late onset ÃÂ² thalassemiaÃ¢ÂÂ, all presenting with the mild phenotype of beta thalassemia minor up to adult age and developing a severe transfusion dependent phe notype in the third and fourth decade of life when a presumed homozygosity for the beta thalassemia mutation is observed. Affymetrix and/or Illumina SNP array analysis revealed incomplete homozygosity for SNPÃ¢ÂÂs along al most the entire short arm of chromosome 11 containing the beta globin gene, indicating mosaicism for a partial uniparental isodisomy of chromo some 11p. Three patients were born asymptomatic as beta thal carriers and developed a severe blood transfusion dependent beta thalassemia major at different ages and with different percentages of mosaicism. Recently we discovered another case showing a similar mosaic UPD of 11p, presenting as a regular beta thalassemia carrier. The fourth patient however did not develop the clinical severity despite of an almost 50% mosaicism determi ned from the DNA isolated from leucocytes. The most probable mechanism seems clonal selection for hematopoietic stem cells containing the unipa rental isodisomy for the mutant beta globin gene during life, this may ac count for the progressive development of the disease. However, there seems to be no correlation between the percentage of mosaicism measured in the DNA isolated from the white cells and the severity of the clinical phenotype related to the expression in red cells, which strongly suggests hematopoietic tissue heterogeneity for the observed UPD containing cell lineages. This may have serious consequences for disease prediction and counseling, as this is largely dependent upon DNA isolated from leucocytes.",2014

21899,"y+LAT1 and 4F2hc are protein subunits that form a transporter complex for cationic amino acids in the basolateral membrane of epithelial cells, mainly in the small intestine and proximal kidney tubules. Mutations of y+LAT1, 56 of which are currently known, cause lysinuric protein intolerance (LPI, OMIM #222700), a rare metabolic disorder characterised by diminished in testinal absorption of the cationic amino acids lysine, arginine and ornithine and by severe loss of these amino acids into the urine. The more detailed structure of this transport complex has so far been unclear it has remai ned unelucidated whether the complex is formed as a dimer or a tetramer of the subunits. What has been known, however, is that the y+LAT1 subu nits cannot reach the plasma membrane without forming a complex with 4F2hc. We previously established fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) microscopy and FRET FACS as tools in studying the interactions of y+LAT1 and 4F2hc. We have now applied these techniques together with immunohistochemistry to the exploration of the heteromerisation status of the y+LAT1/4F2hc transporter complex. We discovered that when fused into fluorescent vectors and transfected into the HEK293 cells, the y+LAT1 proteins interact together in the presence as well as absence of 4F2hc.

The well known mechanism of allelic dropout is the presence of SNPs in 3Ã¢ÂÂ region of PCR primers. The early recognition of allelic dropout prevents diagnostic errors. Materials and Methods: The DNA samples from Brugada syndrome Irani an family were extracted from peripheral blood. Sanger sequencing of SC N5A gene coding areas was performed for proband and relatives. Control re sequencing via semiconductor PGM IonTorrent platform using Ampliseq primer pool encompassing coding area of 10 genes including SCN5A was performed for family members. The control group comprised 100 ethnically matched healthy donors. Results: Sanger sequencing has revealed a novel heterozygous genetic va riant p. P1506S in exon 26 of SCN5A gene in proband. Surprisingly, his son carried p. P1506S variant in homozygous state. Carriage of p. P1506S va riant in mother had been excluded by Sanger sequencing and PCR RFLP analysis. We performed control re sequencing via semiconductor PGM IonTorrent platform for proband and his son. NGS results showed a discre pancy with primary Sanger sequencing results, proving heterozygousity of p. P1506S variant in probandÃ¢ÂÂs son. Sanger re sequencing using alternative oligonucleotide primers for exon 26 confirmed NGS outcome. Thus, SNP rs41315501 was identified in 3Ã¢ÂÂ region of previously used forward primer. Prevalence of rs41315501 was assessed by PCR RFLP in 200 chromosomes cohort and MAF (minor allele frequency) accounted 9,4%. SNP was detected in probandÃ¢ÂÂs wife and son in heterozygous state.

The aim of this study was to develop a rapid, specific and sensitive HRMA approach for scanning AHSP gene. Alpha thalassaemia heterozygotes with the same underlying mutation (ÃÂ±PA1ÃÂ±/ÃÂ±ÃÂ±) but heterogeneity in haematological in dices MCV and MCH and no iron deficiency were selected and divided in three subgroups. Ten normal samples were used as controls. AHSP gene was divided in small sized overlapping amplicons and PCR conditions were op timized prior to HRMA. Samples presenting distinct derivative plots were Sanger sequenced. Two variations were detected. The variation 12895 G>T ( exon III) was detected in samples regardless group and may represent a neutral polymorphism as reported previously. The second variation detec ted, 12391 G>A, is located in an Oct 1 binding site and was also detected in samples from different sub groups. These results indicate that HRM analysis can be used as a fast, cost effective, relatively simple and high throughput amenable method for scanning AHSP gene. This approach can be incor porated in order to analyze higher number of samples and strengthen the characterisation of these changes as neutral or not polymorphisms in the Hellenic population.

Auto Inflammatory Disorders (AIDs) are monogenic diseases caused by primary dysfunctions of the innate immune system. However, molecular diagnosis performed by Sanger sequencing of known genes fails to detect mutations in around 86% of patients recruited to our Unit. Clinical misdia gnosis, mutations in untested gene regions, genetic heterogeneity and/or a complex mode of inheritance are all possible explanations. The Next Generation Sequencing approach has been undertaken to improve mutations detection in AIDs.

Here, we provide a whole genome low coverage sequencing ap proach to detect BCA events independent of knowing the affected regions and with low false positives. First, six samples containing BCAs were used to establish a detection protocol and assess the efficacy of different library con struction approaches. By clustering anomalous read pairs and filtering out the false positive results with a control cohort and the concomitant mapping information, we could directly detect BCA events for each sample. Through optimizing the read depth, BCAs in all samples could be blindly detected with only 120 million read pairs per sample for data from a small insert library and 30 million per sample for data from non size selected mate pair library. This approach was further validated using another 13 samples that contained BCAs. Our approach advances the application of high throughput whole genome low coverage analysis for robust BCA detection, especially for clinical samples, without the need for karyotyping.",2014
21905,"Petersburg, Russian Federation. Gene therapy strategies based on plasmid DNA are more preferable than viral based gene delivery. Plasmids are more stable in vivo and known to be less immunogenic. Retroviral based vectors integrate in actively tran scribed genes that can lead to disruption of tumor suppressor genes. Gene delivery methods based on plasmid DNA do not cause mutagenesis and they do not integrate in chromosomes providing increased safety. Despite the potential advantages of using plasmid DNA, delivery issues with plasmid vectors exist. One of the ways of plasmid delivery into a cell can be biotin streptavidin interaction of the plasmid to a cell penetrating peptide (CPP). Streptavidin binds the small molecule biotin with femtomolar affinity. We have created a biotinylated pEGFP N3 circular plasmid DNA to further its binding to the streptavidin CPP fusion protein. Few thymines were replaced by biotinylated uracils in the plasmid. The presence of biotinylated uracils in purified plasmid was verified in restriction analysis followed by dot blot procedure. Streptavidin conjugated alkaline phosphatase was used to de tect the biotin uracils. The ability to express green fluorescent protein was tested in Hela cell culture. We have created a genetic construct for synthesis of monovalent tetrameric streptavidin, which consists of one WT streptavi din and three inactive streptavidins. Each inactive streptavidin is fused to chain of four HIV TAT peptides. The resulting chimeric protein binds one biotinylated circular plasmid DNA due to the biotin streptavidin interaction. This structure can be used for gene therapy.",2014
21906,"Epigenetic alterations, including DNA methylation, play an important role in the regulation of gene expression. Several methods exist for evaluating DNA methylation, but bisulfite sequencing remains the gold standard by which base pair resolution of CpG methylation is achieved. The main limitation of this method is its harshness to DNA and several commercial kits try to find a balance between reagent harshness and conversion efficiency. Our study compares four popular kits (Diagenode, Promega, Epigentek, Qiagen) regarding their conversion efficiency and degradation effect. We used in vitro methylated and unmethylated forms of two ÃÂ» phage PCR products to create various DNA mixtures (spikes), including ratios 1:0, 1:1, 1:3 and 0:1 methylated to unmethylated DNA. These were bisulfite converted with all 4 kits and then PCR amplified producing templates for Sanger sequencing and NGS. Our Sanger sequencing results showed 100% conversion efficiency of cytosines across all kits and there was a correct trend of methylation status at CpG sites which reflected the expected ratios of the spikes. However, the method was limiting in displaying accurately the extent of methylation in each case. DNA degradation was compared between kits based on the effici ency of PCR amplification and it was shown that the Diagenode and Prome ga kits had the least degrading effect. Our NGS results offered higher resolving power as expected, allowing accu rate assessment of methylation ratios lower than 1:3. Our results indicate bisulfite NGS applications are applicable for detecting small variations in methylation while our comparison shows which kit is the least harsh and the most efficient.",2014
21907,"The aim of our study was to enhance the throughput of mutation detec tion analysis in order to supply high sensitivity, fast and accurate data on BRCA1/2 genesÃ¢ÂÂ mutational status of selected breast and/or ovary cancer patients. Starting from June 2012 a panel of 8 selected BRCA1/2 pathogenic mutationÃ¢ÂÂprone cases have been analysed on a GS 454 Junior platform (Ro che) and 6 out of 8 pathogenic variants were successfully identified. One of the two unidentified variants was a single nucleotide insertion just adjacent to a homopolymer stretch of 8 Adenines in the coding region of BRCA2. The second unidentified variant was a deletion of the whole exon 14 of BRCA1 gene. The latter two unidentified pathogenic variants were revealed subse quently using the BRCA Homopolymer (BRCA HP) kit from MULTIPLICOM and MLPA analysis. We then decided to adopt a Three step mutational scree ning approach. As a first step BRCA1 &2 amplicon libraries were generated with BRCA MASTR tm assay from Multiplicon, and sequenced on our GS 454 junior platform. Sequencing data are then analysed with Amplicon Variant Analyzer (AVA) software (Roche).

For this, the data, almost evenly split among both genes, have been submitted to the LOVD 3 shared gene variant database installation (1,2). Previously, variants identified in Dutch and Flemish (Belgian) DNA diagnostic labs were collected yearly and stored in an Excel data file. Advantages of the LOVD system include: simple submission of new data in a standardized way, instant updates after curati on, easy maintenance and automatic backups. Although most data are pu blicly accessible online, some data are shared by members only. Others can see whether such information is available (password protected file links), giving them the option to contact the submitter for further details. Mem bers can contribute their opinions about variant classification, increasing its consistency, but being aware of potential misinterpretation they have re servations sharing this information. Data are stored variant by variant and connected to each individual patient and submitting diagnostic lab. Using existing LOVD functionality, users can perform queries per gene or individu al, use other linked resources of interest, get genome browser views of the data and use web services to access variants stored in other gene variant databases. In addition, LOVD3 has a new access level, designated Ã¢ÂÂcollabo ratorÃ¢ÂÂ, allowing submitters to share otherwise non public data with other submitters, e.g., to share detailed phenotype information with other diagno stic labs only.1) http://databases.lovd.nl/shared/genes/BRCA12) http://databases.lovd.nl/shared/genes/BRCA2",2014

Objec tive: To determine whether the cardiomyopathy specific genes are covered sufficiently good enough to justify the use of TruSight ONE in clinical ge netic testing. Subjects, Materials and Methods: In order to initially analyze control samples, DNA was obtained from three individuals presenting with conditions other than cardiomyopathy (CM). TruSight ONE DNA enrichment and next generation sequencing (NGS) was conducted according to the manufacturerÃ¢ÂÂs instructions using a MiSeq instrument. A proprietary NGS data processing and filtering pipeline was used. Results: A) Performance characteristics for 46 core CM genes: The fraction of bases covered with less than 20 reads varied between 2.3 and 5.4% (mean: 3.7%). The average read depth varied in the range of 84 to 147 fold (mean: 120 fold). A mean of 4 relevant variants (i.e. missense, nonsense or splicing) was observed (range: 2 8). B) Performance characteristics for a set of 288 genes annotated for cardiomyopathy by NCBIÃ¢ÂÂs Entrez Gene (including the 46 core CM genes): A mean fraction of low coverage bases of 4.7% was observed (range: 3.7 6.6%).

In this study, we collected and tested blindly 18 photos of probands with a molecularly confirmed or clinical diagnosis of CdLS and 10 with confirmed diagnosis of various non CdLS syndromes (e.g., kabuki, Aarskog, dubowitz, etc.). For each photo, the system produced a score above (positive) or below (negative) a threshold, determined from the results of the original study.4/5 probands with the NIPBL mutation (including 1 mosaic mutation), 3/4 with the SMC1L1 mutation and 5/9 clinically diagnosed by geneticists as CdLS like, but carrying various genomic imbalances, received positive scores. 10/10 non CdLS probands received a negative score. The 6 false negatives were reported to have a mild phenotype or not to meet the clinical diagno stic criteria, of which 3 received a score well below the threshold and 3 a score immediately below the threshold, suggesting that the threshold may be skewed upwards and requires further adjustment to increase systemÃ¢ÂÂs sensitivity from 67% to 83%, while maintaining specificity of 100%.

Celiac Disease (CeD; Ã¢ÂÂgluten intoleranceÃ¢ÂÂ) is diagnosed by symptoms, detec ting CeD specific antibodies, and biopsy results. The only available therapy is a life long gluten free diet. Despite the availability of diagnostic tools, as many as 7 out of 8 adult CeD patients are either not or incorrectly diagnosed, highlighting the need for novel biomarkers. Circulating miRNA profiles have been shown to be disease specific, even disease stage specific, in patients with cancer or gastro intestinal disease. We examined whether circulating miRNAs in plasma samples of CeD pati ents can be used as CeD biomarkers. By next generation sequencing we pro filed miRNAs in 95 plasma samples from 12 CeD patients, 5 patients positive for CeD associated antibodies and 5 control subjects from the Prevent CD cohort. In this cohort, newborns at risk for CeD were challenged with low levels of gluten between 4 6 months of age to induce gluten tolerance, and plasma samples were taken every 3 months until diagnosis. Comparing data from samples taken at diagnosis to samples taken at 3 months of age (first available sample), we found 62 miRNAs significantly differently expressed (FDR<0.05). Of those, 4 miRNAs were previously reported to be associated with CeD, 12 were implicated in other autoimmune diseases and 7 miRNAs have been implicated in immune signaling. One of these immune related miRNAs is miR 23b, which appears to be downregulated 2 fold in CeD pati ents at time of diagnosis. This miRNA is known to limit tissue inflammation.

Structural damage in cfDNA molecules in body fluids has been little studied. Such damage may reflect normal and abnormal cell turnover, genome in stablity or exporsure to genotoxic agents. We analyzed cfDNA damage in plasma, urine and saliva. Standard methods of isolation of cfDNA in plasma and urine are based on inducing ssDNA with a chaotropic agent and selec tive cordination binding of lone pair electrons on guanine to silica. These methods were not usable. In contrast, we found that selective ion exchange chromatography allowed gentle isolation of DNA without inducing damage. Damage in isolated DNA was assessed with the Northern Lights Assay. This assay is based on Two Dimensional Strandness Dependent Electrophoresis (2D SDE) in premade microgels. Each sample was run in duplicate i.e. uncut and cut with Mbo I, an enzyme which cuts both single and double stranded DNA. Single stranded breaks, either nicks or gaps, were detected as horizon tal streaks from uncut DNA molecules. Double stranded breaks generated an arc in the gel. DNA molecules with interstrand crosslinks (ICL) migrated as an arc behind normal dsDNA molecules. DNA with intrastrand crosslinks and bulky adducts were bent and migrated in front of that arc. Single stran ded DNA molecules, too damaged for complementary strand binding, for med a diagonal line.

In 1997 the first annual German exter nal quality assessment (EQA) was performed for CMT1A. At this time the molecular genetic analysis was mainly based on 5 methods: RFLP Southern blotting, STR markers, PCR for junction fragments within the CMT1A REP elements, PFGE and FISH. 10 laboratories in Germany participated. In the year 2000 the scheme was offered to a wider audience with 22 participating laboratories. Only one genotyping error occurred. Since 2008 the European Molecular Genetics Quality Network (EMQN) has organised the EQA sche me. In 2012 the number of participating laboratories increased to 66 from 22 countries (198 reports) representing countries from around the globe.

Residual leukemia is assessed by a sensitive molecular quantitative manner evaluating levels of BCR ABL1 transcripts by real time reverse transcriptase PCR (qRT PCR). Undetectable levels of chimeric transcript, however, can reflect either an effective elimination of leukemia cells, or the presence of a quiescent leuke mic stem cells transcriptionally silent. We developed a novel highly sensitive method to identify quiescent leukemic cells and possible candidates for dis continuation of therapy through quantitative real time PCR (Q PCR) based on the DNA.

The current system processes eight samples simultaneously and has a liquid handling system that delivers PCR reagents to a cartridge with microfluidic channels used for rapid PCR and HSM. A unique feature is that once PCR/HSM is completed (<12min per test), reagents for the next assay are then delivered, tested and analyzed. We tested 100 blinded clinical blood samples (obtained from ARUP Labo ratories) for F2 (c.*97G>A), F5 (c.1601G>A), and MTHFR (c.665C>T and 1286A>C) genotype using this instrument. The samples were also tested on a LightScannerÃÂ®32 (Biofire TM) using high resolution melting analysis (HRMA) assays designed by the University of Utah. Data from both instru ments was interpreted using custom Melting Wizard software. Results show that all four tests with all 100 samples were genotyped accurately. Follow up testing was required on 1.4% of the assays for a definitive genotype. The prototype instrument described allows for extremely rapid PCR (each thermal cycle < 15 seconds) and HSM (melting rate up to 2ÃÂ°C/s) due to uni que design of the microfluidic chip. The onboard liquid handling system al lows multiple tests to be performed sequentially, and adding tests during the run. This method facilitates reflex testing, such as exon scanning follo wed by a reflexive genotyping assay, or a second reflexive genotyping assay. These features are better aligned with a workflow that requires multiple tests run on a single sample adding flexibility compared to current batch PCR workflows.",2014

Our study aims to determine the proportion of familial nonsyndromic con genital heart defects (CHD) that can be explained by pathogenic mutations in currently known CHD associated genes, by implementing next generati on sequencing technologies in genetic diagnosis for familial nonsyndromic CHD. Targeted resequencing of known cardiac genes was performed in 36 patients from 13 nonsyndromic CHD families, using either array based or solution based method to capture the coding regions of 57 genes associated with CHD. Following variant analysis and Sanger validation, we identified 6 functional deleterious mutations in 3 genes, explaining the defects in 6 families. The genetic heterogeneity of CHD and remarkable variability of expression make it challenging to interpret the large number of identified variants in patients. Thus, setting up a well defined analysis pipeline is necessary to identify causative mutations. In conclusion, by targeted rese quencing of known CHD associated genes in well selected nonsyndromic CHD families and cautious variant interpretation, likely causative mutations were identified in 6/13 (46%) families. Reduced penetrance and possibili ty of phenocopies complicate the interpretation. Targeted next generation sequencing is a powerful tool in genetic testing of familial nonsyndromic CHD, however, variant interpretation remains a major challenge for the dia gnostic application.

In the first family, with one affected child, we found a known pathogenic in frame deletion of the isoprenoid synthase domain containing protein gene (ISPD). Mutations in this gene are known to be associated to congenital mu scular dystrophy phenotypes. In the other family, with two affected sibs, we identified a mutation in RYR1 gene.

We present a simple closed tube method based on high resolution melting that is accurate enough to reliably determine all common CNV ratios. Target and reference regions of genomic DNA were PCR amplified together using a variety of reagent and cycling protocols. We found that the ratios of reference and copy number variants were maintained either by limiting PCR cycles, or by limiting quan tities of dNTPs or Taq polymerase and allowing PCR to plateau. High reso lution melting analysis with the DNA binding dye LCGreen Plus was used to determine CNV ratios from the relative heights of the target melting peak after reference melting peaks were equalized. All common CNV ratios may be detected using any of the PCR limiting protocols. The most robust and simplest method uses limiting dNTP concentrations. CNV ratios differing by 10% could be distinguished when dNTPs were limited to 3.25 uM. Trisomy was easily and accurately typed using duplex PCR, and chromosome X and Y copy number variants were identified using triplex PCR. The method also identified large CFTR exon 2 and exon 3 heterozygous deletions that are dif ficult to detect using other approaches. This protocol is simple, closed tube, fast, economical, and is more accurate and less susceptible to contamination than other methods. Assays are easy to design, limiting dNTPs is simple, and the results are stable and reliable.

Concentrations were then measured as levels of amplicons of two genes, housekeeping gene GAPDH and human RHD gene (exon 10). The same genes were analyzed in plasma cell free DNA and also in cell free fetal DNA isolated from maternal plasma. Evaluation of these two methodsÃ¢ÂÂ performance was based on several parameters, such as degree of linearity (RÃÂ²), accuracy, detection limit, etc. In case of standard nuclear DNA, both methods showed high accuracy and low detection limit, both ge nes were detected even in most diluted samples. High linearity degree (RÃÂ² > 0.99) has been reached by both methods. The correct RHD status of te sted women was immunologically verified. Regarding analysis of cell free fetal DNA in RHD negative maternal plasma, dPCR failed against the qPCR to convincingly distinguish RHD positive samples from the negative ones. For the purpose of prenatal screening, the qPCR method would be probably the preferable alternative due to very low fetal DNA concentrations (about 0.002 ng/ul) in maternal plasma, which is under the detection limit of dPCR.

Then, comparing the IPGM and Sanger se quencing data, we asses sensitivity (100%), specificity (99%) and accuracy (100%). In addition to confirming all the mutations (31 alleles) identified by Sanger sequencing, this study allowed us to characterize another 18 out of the 54 FA alleles in our cohort. The remaining 5 are likely to be localized in genomic region not covered by the sequencing analyses. Moreover, quan titative analysis aimed at detecting copy number variations (CNVs) detec ted complete (n,1) and partial (n,7) deletions of FANCA, or entire removal (n,1) of FANCD2.All the CNVs were confirmed by SNP array or MLPA analy sis. Our data suggest that IPGM is suitable for detection of point mutations and large deletion in FA.",2014
21928,"Gaslini Institute, Genoa, Italy. Genetic testing of Fragile X disorders is now performed with PCR based me thods which sensitivity and precision allow detection and accurate sizing of FMR1 alleles in the entire spectrum of the CGG repeat amplifications. These molecular tools, designed to analyze a region of DNA with intrinsic characte ristics of instability, could lead to new observations that were out of reach of previous methods. We report the detection of a smaller and less represented fragment in PCR amplifications of the FMR1 repeat region in independent samples of unrelated individuals, three males with intellectual disability and one normal female, with otherwise normal Fragile X alleles and karyoty pe. A smaller fragment present in PCR reactions from different DNA extrac tions and samples of each identified individual, has been detected by three different Italian laboratories with different settings (primers, amplification, electrophoresis). In one of the cases both parents of the proband resulted to not carry the smaller fragment, thereby excluding a rare X chromosome or autosomal polymorphism as a possible cause. The possibility of random so matic instability as a cause of such finding in our cases is challenged by the similar size (286 293 bp) and quantitative representation of the peak. The fact that the same result has been found in four unrelated subjects (three Italian and one Israeli) out of 2000 tested, suggests a frequency of about 1/500 individuals. Further characterization of the extra peak is underway to establish its sequence origin and better understand the nature of what could give new information on the Fragile X region.",2014
21929,"With the advance of sequencing technologies, the capacity to generate ac curate genotype data greatly outpaces our ability to analyse it. To facilitate data intrepretation, a framework were developed for estimating the relative pathogenicity of variants. We used Tuberous Sclerosis, an autosomal domi nant Neurogenetic disorder caused by mutations in either TSC1 or TSC2, to test our famework. As all kinds of mutations, including single nucleotide variants (SNVs), small insertions/deletions (indels), and large deletion/du plication mutations have been reproted in TSC1 and TSC2 scattering almost all along the 65 exons of the two genes without any obvious hotspot, the Neurogenetic disorders panel including 399 genes, in addition to TSC1 and TSC2, was used for the genetic analysis of 276 referred TSC, or probably TSC patients. All identified variants of potential clinical interest were verified by Sanger sequencing or MLPA in probands and family members whenever available. 137 patients (49.6%) were found to carry known disease causing mutations, 98 (35.5%) patients carried 93 unique highly likely pathogenic variants. Accumulatively, this assay were able to identify the causative mu tation in 85.1% (237/276) TSC patients. Of note, 23 large structural vari ants and 2 cases of somatic mosaicism were identified in our patients which might otherwise be neglected in sanger sequencing based genetic testing. In conclusion, our framework can be readily used to analyze the gene variant profiles of TSC with high sensitivity, fidelity, throughput and speed. This fra mework lay the basis for the genetic testing of other complex Neurogenetic disorders.",2014
21930,"Targeted chemotherapy directed at epidermal growth factor receptor for treatment of non small cell lung carcinoma patients has been put forward as an alternative to standard chemotherapy. However, the application of EGFR inhibitors therapy is only effective in cancers with mutated and overactive EGFR, requiring preliminary screening to detect EGFR mutations. Typically, diagnostics procedures examine the profile of genetic alterations in tumours removed for biopsy in search for mutations that make them sus ceptible to treatment. Usually, DNA mutations are detected by PCR and con firmed by sequencing, which are quite expensive and time consuming. Thus, the trend in molecular analysis is directed at increasing sensitivity rather the multi loci analysis. Therefore, multiplexing and multiparallel strategies may become an alternative to directed analysis of whole spectra of mutati ons. The LungCARD project aims the development and optimisation of a low cost microfluidic chip to assess EGFR mutations directly from immune captured circulating tumour cells (CTCs). Here, we present the optimisation of a pro tocol for PCR amplification of EGFR exon 19 and 21 directly from single cells and the subsequent identification of mutations present via a gold nanopar ticle based assay. This colorimetric assay is based on the non cross linking approach using a set of gold nanoprobes (thiol functionalised gold nanopar ticles) that are capable to specifically detect the EGFR variants. Furthermo re, preliminary results from Ferguson plot analysis revealed that wild type and mutated samples present distinct rfs and can be discriminated.

21931,", Salt Lake City, UT , United States, 2Myriad Genetics, Inc., Salt Lake City, UT , United States. Assessment of hereditary breast and ovarian cancer risk should inclu de germline sequencing of BRCA1 and BRCA2 as well as additional genes with known associations in breast/ovarian cancer patients. Sanger DNA sequencing has been the gold standard for molecular genetic analysis but next generation sequencing (NGS) platforms could provide another sequen cing alternative. However, optimized assay design and validation are critical to maximize the analytical sensitivity and specificity of NGS assays and to ensure high quality interpretation for clinical decision making. We develo ped a 25 gene NGS hereditary cancer panel that uses RainDance PCR tech nology for high throughput sample preparation, Illumina HiSeq and MiSeq NGS technologies, and commercially available and lab developed informatic tools. Initial assessment of analytical sensitivity and specificity was perfor med by comparing BRCA1 and BRCA2. NGS was performed on 1864 anony mized patient samples, which had previously undergone BRCA1 and BRCA2 Sanger sequencing. Sanger sequencing identified 15,878 variants, of which 681 were unique and 482 were classified as disease associated mutations. We identified 15,877 variants at an initial sensitivity of >99.99% for BRCA1 and BRCA2. One polymorphic variant was missed due to a variant under the primer. Sensitivity was subsequently optimized through process improve ments. No additional variants were found by NGS, yielding a specificity of 100%. This preliminary analysis facilitated assay optimization and validati on of all 25 genes in the NGS panel. This analysis indicates that a NGS gene panel designed to meet rigorous quality standards can be used to provide clinical sequencing results equivalent to those obtained from Sanger DNA sequencing analysis.",2014
21932,"Clinical Genetics, Laboratory for DNA Diagnostics, Amsterdam, Netherlands. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is one of the most common inherited cardiovascular disorder with an estimated prevalence of 1/500. About half of the cases are familial and mutations in MYBPC3 are among the most fre quent cause of HCM. Here we report on 14 patients with HCM in which single nucleotide substi tutions potentially affect splicing of the MYBPC3 gene. Twelve mutations are located either on the last nucleotide of an exon or within the consensus 3Ã¢ÂÂ and 5Ã¢ÂÂ splice site sequences, while two are situated outside these regions. Mutations at the exon intron junctions can potentially affect splicing. Howe ver, only changes affecting the invariant AG GT nucleotides are considered to be certainly pathogenic, while the rest require functional studies. Mutations were first analysed in silico, using a combination of 5 splice site prediction algorithms, integrated in the Alamut 2.0 Splicing prediction module. For 12 mutations splicing prediction analysis indicated an effect on splicing and for 2 there were no alterations. Subsequently, all mutations were analysed by cDNA sequence analysis and these results were compared to the prediction models. In all patients the results of sequence analysis were consistent with the predicted effect, namely exon skipping, intron inclusion, partial exon de letions and insertions of intronic sequences or no altered splicing at all. In conclusion, this study indicates that in silico splicing analysis can accurately and reliably predict the effect on splicing of mutations occurring at exon/intron junctions representing a helpful tool in DNA diagnostics for the as sessment of the pathogenicity of a sequence variant.",2014
21933,"Hereditary Non Polyposis Hereditary Colorectal Cancer (HNPCC) or Lynch syndrome is an autosomal dominantly inherited cancer susceptibility caused by germline mutations in one of the DNA mismatch repair (MMR) genes (MSH2, MLH1, PMS2 and MSH6). Although most of the mutations re ported in these genes are point mutations, large genomic rearrangements in one of the MMR genes occur with a frequency varying from 5 to 20% depending on the population. Effective methods to identify these types of mutation should be integrated in current diagnostic procedure to obtain a more comprehensive genetic screening strategy. Molecular Combing is a powerful FISH based technique for the direct visualization of single DNA molecules which allows exploration of the genome at high resolution in a single analysis. We are developing a novel HNPCC genetic test based on molecular combing, for which specific Ã¢ÂÂgenomic Morse codesÃ¢ÂÂ (GMC) have been designed for each MMR genes. These GMC have been validated on com bed genomic DNA extracted from the cancer derived cell lines LoVo and Sk OV 3, which harbor MSH2 and MLH1 large deletion respectively, and from HNPCC patients. From these patients, large rearrangements corresponding to either deletions of one to several exons in one of the MMR genes and with sizes ranging from 4 kb to 53 kb or the paracentric inversion in the MSH2 gene have been detected. Importantly, the mutations identified by Molecular Combing confirm the results previously obtained by Southern Blot analysis on the same patients, with a resolution in the 1 2 kb range.",2014
21934,"Introduction: Sudden cardiac death without an attributable cause after clinical diagnostic work up, is defined as idiopathic ventricular fibrillation (IVF). Mutations in genes primarily involved in inherited arrhythmia syn dromes underlie some cases of IVF. Methods: An IVF patient underwent routine mutational analysis of 6 ar rhythmia susceptibility genes (KCNQ1 , KCNH2, SCN5A , KCNE1, KCNE2 and RYR2) through direct sequencing. Afterwards, exome sequencing (Agilent SureSelect) was performed on the proband and his non affected parents on an Illumina HiSeq2000 (minimum coverage 20x for 90% of bases, genotype quality scoreÃ¢ÂÂ¥40). Identified variants were subjected to a 3 step filtering strategy (de novo, nonsynonymous, absent from dbSNP 1000Genomes).Results: Traditional mutation scanning failed to identify a pathogenic va riant. When exome sequencing was performed, a RYR2 candidate variant was identified (c.12006G>T , p. M4002I) that however could not be validated by Sanger sequencing. This prompted further investigation and all factors contributing to either a stochastic sampling or a systematic error were eva luated. Previously published primer sequences were inspected. A SNP near the primerÃ¢ÂÂs 3Ã¢ÂÂ site (rs790889, MAF,0.426) was identified and hypothesized to cause the mutant allele to drop out. Targeted screening with redesigned primers confirmed the presence of the variant. Conclusion: In routine diagnostics often laboratories use screening con ditions reported through literature dated at a time when genetic variation information was not widely available. Allelic dropout or, more precisely, the occurrence of a null/false allele due to primer target mismatch, constitutes an avoidable laboratory error. Our report highlights the need to periodically reevaluate even previously well established screening conditions.",2014
21935,"Background: Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is characterized by the pre sence of the Philadelphia (Ph) chromosome. Ph chromosome results from the translocation of ABL protoonkogene from chromosome 9 and BCR gene on chromosome 22, which leads to the formation of BCR ABL chimeric gene with constitutive tyrosine kinase activity. Imatinib (Gleevec) is the first BCR ABL tyrosine kinase inhibitor used in the treatment of CML. Second genera tion drugs such as nilotinib and dasatinib, are now considered as alternative treatments to imatinib. Point mutations the kinase domain of the BCR ABL were detected from 40% to 90% of the Gleevec resistance cases. These mu tations disrupt the binding site of imatinib on the tyrosine kinase, resulting in a loss of sensitivity to the drugs. Method: We performed a pyrosequen cing assay panel for the detection of eleven important mutations in BCR ABL kinase domain, which are Y253H, Y253F, E255K, E255V, V299L, T315A, T315I, F317L, F317V, F359C, F359V.

Conclusion: Our pyrosequencing assay for imatinib resistant mutations provides a reliable method for the detection of the mutant BCR ABL transcripts and also provides a significant value for the follow up of CML patients on imatinib.",2014
21936,"Cancer develops as a consequence of genetic mutations, which results in deregulation of gene expression and/or proteins with aberrant functions. These changes often interfere with cellular processes such as survival and proliferation. The cancer cells evolve and are subjected to natural selection through interplay with its microenvironment. As is the case with other eco systems, also the tissue microenvironment changes and responds to the populations in its niche and to external interference. Communication with other cells in the microenvironment will provide input signals that are in terpreted by the malignant cells, and responded to, based on their altered genetic programs. Hence, the consequence of a mutation has to be viewed in the environmental context of each individual cell. The activity status of a protein or signaling pathway can be visualized with in situ Proximity Li gation Assays (in situ PLA) using a pair of antibodies equipped with DNA oligonucleotides (proximity probes) to target interacting proteins. Proximal binding of such probes template the creation of a circular DNA molecule, which is a surrogate marker for the interaction. We recently developed a multiplexed version of in situ PLA by introducing unique tags as identifiers in each different proximity probe. The combinatorial events generating an in situ PLA signal will harbor a set of identifier tags that will be unique for each protein interaction. By combining in situ PLA with padlock probes, analysis of signaling activity can be achieved together with genotyping expressed mRNA in fixed tissue sections, retaining the architectural information while providing single molecule resolution.",2014

Chimerism analysis is performed to monitor peripheral blood or bone marrow in the recipient after allogenic stem cell transplan tation to monitor for leukemic relapse. Observation of increasing mixed chimerism after transplantation is associated with a higher risk of relapse in acute leukemia. Previously, a quantitative PCR (qPCR) technique, using in sertion/deletion polymorphisms, was found to predict relapse in 88.2% vs. 44.4% of individuals analyzed by VNTR markers with a median anticipation period of 58 days and a sensitivity of 0.01% vs. 3%. Here we present results from research experiments performed to determine if a digital PCR (dPCR) method is able to predict relapse earlier and with greater accuracy than the qPCR method using retrospective leukemia samples. Research results sho wed that dPCR using the QuantStudioÃ¢ÂÂ¢ 3D Digital PCR System and the qPCR method yielded similar percent recipient chimerism values when recipient DNA was present above the 1% level. Furthermore, dPCR using the system was found to be more sensitive than the qPCR method based on the ability to detect the recipient DNA in a relapsed individual about 2 months earlier where the percent recipient chimerism was 0.2% or less. The false positi ve rate was close to the complete chimerism value of 0.01% for peripheral blood samples.",2014
21938,"The presence of certain chromosomal rearrangements and the subsequent fusion gene derived from translocations has been implicated in a number of cancers. Hundreds of translocations have been described in the literatu re recently but the need to efficiently detect and further characterize these chromosomal translocations is growing exponentially. The two main me thods to identify and monitor translocations, fluorescent in situ hybridiza tion (FISH) and comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) are challenging, labor intensive, the information obtained is limited, and sensitivity is rather low. Common sample types for these analyses are biopsies or small tumors, which are very limited in material making the downstream measurement of more than one analyte rather difficult; obtaining another biopsy, using a different section or splitting the sample can raise issues of tumor hetero geneity. The ability to study mutation status (DNA) as well as measuring fu sion transcript expression (RNA) from the same sample is powerful because youÃ¢ÂÂre maximizing the information obtained from a single precious sample and eliminating any sample to sample variation. We isolated DNA and RNA from the same non small lung adenocarcinoma sample without splitting or dividing the sample, and both mutation analysis, as well as fusion transcript detection was performed using the Ion Torrent PGMÃ¢ÂÂ¢ platform on the same Ion 318Ã¢ÂÂ¢ chip.

Here we describe the development and verification of an Ion AmpliSeq RNA fusion panel that can simultaneously detect ALK, RET , ROS1 and NTRK1 fusion transcripts in a single reaction. For the development of the panel we used previously characterized samples comprising 6 cancer cell lines and 62 FFPE lung tu mor samples. Upon RNA isolation and amplification using the panel, samp les were sequenced on the Ion PGM system. Initially, using serial dilutions of RNA from cell lines in normal RNA a limit of detection of 1% was esta blished. Next, using the FFPE samples a fusion transcript was detected in 21 of the 24 known positive samples. Two of the non concordant results were due to lack of representative tumor material. For the third, although no spe cific fusion transcript was identified, the internal control for ALK expression revealed the presence of an unknown ALK fusion transcript. Additionally, two new RET fusions were detected in samples not previously tested for RET translocations. These preliminary results are highly encouraging re garding the possibility of a reliable experimental protocol for the detection of fusion transcripts in the biological material routinely obtained for the diagnosis of lung cancer.

In parallel, new genes have been identified allowing genotype phenotype correlations. However, over lapping phenotypes and non informative pedigrees are still sources of de layed diagnosis. For these reasons, it would be more rapid and cost effective to propose a simultaneous analysis of the nine genes identified so far. Here, we propose a Next Generation Sequencing solution, tested in our series. NBIA genes (ATP13A2, CP , C19orf12, DCAF17; FA2H, FTL, PANK2, PLA2G6 and WDR45) were included in a custom panel of 35 genes dedicated to our routine molecular diagnosis platform.

21946,"Massively parallel next generation cDNA sequencing (RNA Seq), has allowed many advances in the characterization and quantification of transcriptomes, including the detection of non canonical transcription start sites and ter mination sites, and identification of alternative splice isoforms, transcript mutations and edits. Additionally, the ability to obtain information on the originating strand is useful for reasons including for example: identification of antisense transcripts, determination of the transcribed strand of nonco ding RNAs, and determination of expression levels of coding or noncoding overlapping transcripts. However, standard methods for sequencing RNA do not provide information on the DNA strand from which the RNA strand was transcribed, and methods for strand specific library preparation can be inefficient and time consuming. To address this challenge we developed a streamlined, low input method for Directional RNA Sequencing that high ly retains strand orientation information while maintaining even coverage of transcript expression. This method is based on second strand labeling and excision after adaptor ligation; allowing differential tagging of the first strand cDNA ends. We have also extended the utility of this method by developing additional adaptor and primers, including a dual barcoding approach for multiplexing up to 96 samples. As a result, we have enabled highly multiplexed, strand specific mRNA sequencing, as well as whole tran scriptome sequencing (Total RNA seq) from ribosomal depleted samples, enabling the discovery of a much broader picture of expression dynamics including discovery of antisense transcripts.

By these means we designed primers and generated li braries to investigate exons, flanking introns and UTRs of 18 genes invol ved in 15 human blood systems, for a total of ~57 kilobases. After norma lization by two different approaches, libraries were sequenced by the Ion PGMÃ¢ÂÂ¢ Sequencer (Ion Torrent). While all coding DNA sequences, except in ABO, exhibited a significant ~90% coverage, data analysis of genotypes in homologous genes (i.e., RHD and RHCE; GYPA, GYPB, and GYPE) resulted in discrepancy with what expected due to misassignment of sequencing data to target genes by analysis softwares. That prompted us to specifically PCR amplify the exons in our genes of interest with gene specific primers. PCR products were subsequently fragmented and sequences from homologous genes were labeled with different barcodes. All products were mixed with the AmpliSeqÃ¢ÂÂ¢ generated products before sequencing. Sequencing data were finally found to be in accordance with known genotypes. This work actually made the proof of principle that 1/ libraries generated by two dif ferent means can be combined and sequenced together, and 2/ gene spe cific primers are required to accurately investigate genotypes in homolo gous pairs of genes. Meanwhile we also define conditions to reduce both intra and intersample variability. Overall this study illustrates that NGS is applicable for blood group genotyping, and may be used in a near future for molecular diagnosis at the laboratory level.",2014
21949,"Syndromes resulting in primary structural heart disease or arrhythmia are characterized by a large clinical variability and a significant genetic hete rogeneity. In fact, in a diagnostic setting it is not uncommon to have more than 40 genes as potential targets for an individual patient. For patient care, this situation is often not satisfactory because a precise diagnosis of the un derlying cause of the disease directly affects patient treatment and allows counseling on risks for relatives. To address these issues we designed an enrichment panel covering 97 ge nes, including all genes currently associated with LQT , SQT , BrS, IVFA, ARVC, HCM, DCM, RCM and SUDS/SIDS. After targeted enrichment, the DNA is se quenced on an Illumina MiSeq and subjected to analysis employing our ana lysis pipeline. Our strategy includes an indication specific analysis with an in depth evaluation for highly penetrant genes with a prevalence of >5% where we complement regions with a coverage below 50x by Sanger sequencing. For the remaining genes we generate a screening report and usually achie ve coverage above 50x for more than 95% of bases. Up to date we applied our cardiovascular NGS panel to more than 25 patients, which allowed us to establish a definite diagnosis in many of these cases. For example, we detec ted mutations in MYBPC3 in 5 out of our 8 patients with suspected HCM. We will present a summary of interesting cases and our experiences with this interesting diagnostic tool.",2014

In contrast, we investigated whether sequencing only the affec ted patient without parents is sufficient to find the causative mutation, lea ding to a considerable reduce in costs. In this study, we enrolled 36 patients with unexplained ID, and sequenced the exome. The exome sequences were analysed with a stringent post sequencing annotation pipeline including an ABSTRACTS POSTERS ESHG 2014 | MILAN, ITALY | WWW. ESHG. ORG 288Back to inde x ID gene panel of ~500 genes for filtering of the data. All remaining variants with a potential clinical consequence were validated by Sanger sequencing and tested in the parents for inheritance. After variant filtering we noticed an average of 13 variants per patient (ran ge 2 to 27) requiring further clinical interpretation. The majority of these variants were inherited from one of the parents. Hitherto, we identified 5 de novo mutations in 36 patients (14%).Without exome sequencing the parents, a relatively high amount of poten tially pathogenic variants remain. All these variants require clinical inter pretation which is very time consuming, while most of these variants were likely benign because they are inherited from one of the parents. With trio analysis inherited variants can be filtered out suggesting that this strategy, at this moment, is more efficient in identifying the causative variant. In the future when databases are filled with more and more exome data and con sequently with more rare benign variants, exome sequencing single patients will become a more realistic diagnostic approach.",2014
21951,"24 years after the discovery of the CFTR gene, more than 1900 anomalies are described, mainly single base pair substitutions or micro insertions/ deletions, but many large rearrangements are also described. Identification of mutations has important implications for genetic counsel ling, prenatal diagnosis, cascade screening in families, and for understan ding the genotype phenotype relationship. Classical approaches for gene analysis aim either to look for point mutations or to identify large deletions or duplications, but no strategy allows, to date, to identify both types of mutations. Since a few years, NGS technologies enable us to overcome the classical ap proaches of whole coding sequence sequencing at single nucleotide reso lution. The aim of this study is to validate NGS data analysis to detect large rearran gements in the CFTR gene.23 DNA carrying known large deletions (n,20) or duplications (n,3) pre viously identified by CGH array or qFM PCR and two control samples, one complete deletion, and the other corresponding to the wild type sequence of the gene were included in this study. Analysis was conducted by SeqNext and Nextgene sofwares and by a simple spreadsheet by comparing the average depths obtained for each amplicon. This method allowed us to confirm all the large deletions/duplications af fecting more than one exon. Only one short deletion of 1 kb affecting exon 17b alone was not detected by both methods. In conclusion, NGS technology should be the first technique that allows in a single step both the identification of point mutations and large rearrange ment in a gene.",2014

Clinical use of Next Generation Sequences (NGS) technologies is appealing, but requires high accuracy, simple assays, small inexpensive instruments, flexible throughput, short run times and most importantly, robust data ana lysis as well as tools for biological interpretation of results. We have launched a pilot project to assess the clinical value of NGS techno logy according to the following criteria: 1) phenotypes characterized by ge netic heterogeneity; 2) accurate selection of patients in collaboration with a clinical team; 3) the informed consent of the patient to perform the test. We performed targeted NGS analysis on 38 selected patients with Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) and Epileptic Encephalopathies (EE) using custom panels of candidate genes on PGM (Life Technologies).Our study highlight important issues which have to be considered for the accountability of management and transmission of the results: 1) increased identification of new variants with uncertain pathogenic value affecting the expectance of patients, especially in predictive or presymptomatic testing; 2) incomplete representation and coverage of target regions lead to missing clinically relevant mutations. Accordingly, Sanger sequencing seems to be required to analyse specific genomic segment. 3) Our experience indicates that most of identified nonsynonymous missense coding variants are valida ted by standard sequencing techniques. On the other hand small indels are more frequently false positives or miscalled. The study confirms the potential of NGS techniques, indicates caution in in terpretation and validation of data and suggests a soft transition between classical methods and NGS approach in clinical application.",2014
21953,"University of Valencia, Paterna (Valencia), Spain. c We have developed a NGS based procedure, called NextGeneDx, with the main objective that it can be used for genetic diagnosis, by using specific designs targeted at specific clinical problems. High coverage and represen tativity (100%) guaranties a sensitivity and specificity comparable to San ger sequencing. Validation has been performed by an extensive comparison between the results obtained with NextGeneDx and Sanger sequencing. Versatility and robustness of NextGeneDx allows to increasing gradually the number of genes and diseases analysed. Nine months after the validation of the whole procedure we have developed more than 46 NextGeneDx ser vices for multigenic or genetically heterogeneous diseases including more than 180 genes. The application of this technology in the clinical practice shows a significant reduction of the global costs of sequencing, making ac cessible the diagnosis of multigenic and heterogeneous diseases, bringing to an increase in the detection of disease causing mutations and, definite ly, a higher number of patients with a genetic diagnosis. Cost effectiveness analyses, from DNA extraction to obtain the final report, bear an important reduction of the costs, especially that related with hands on and turnaround time, without compromising the diagnostic accuracy of the analysis. In con clusion, NextGeneDx provides an analytical accuracy comparable to Sanger sequencing and permits the analysis of all of the coding region and adjacent intronic sequences including those refractory to other types of sequencing. Therefore, NextGeneDx is a cost effective approach for the genetic diagno sis of multigenic and genetically heterogeneous illnesses, with a negligible number of incidental findings or unsolicited genomic information.",2014
21954,"Next generation sequencing of cell free DNA, isolated from plasma of pregnant women, is widely used for noninvasive prenatal testing (NIPT) for fetal trisomies. Recently, a new upgrade for the SOliD platform was released: the SOLiD Wildfire. The Wildfire has a simplified sample preparation proto col removing the laborious and expensive emulsion PCR step, an increased sequencing throughput, and the capability to use individual lanes and reuse unused flowchip lanes. Consequently, run time and costs are reduced si gnificantly whilst obtaining equal numbers of mapped reads for statistical analysis. In this study, we aimed to validate the use of the SOLiD Wildfire for NIPT . In total, 154 samples were tested (between 11 20th weeks of ge station) including sixteen T21, ten T18 and four T13 (validated by karyoty ping or QF PCR in chorion villi or amniocytes). Cell free DNA was extracted from 1 ml plasma and processed using a NIPT optimized library preparation and multiplexed (up to 16 plex). Libraries were sequenced on the Wildfire (35bp) targeting > 10 million uniquely mapped reads without mismatches per sample. The in house developed pipeline CHROMATE (CHROMosomal Aneuploidy TEster) was used for GC correction, read filtering, and statistical analysis to calculate Z scores. To conclude, we demonstrate that the Wildfi re can be used to reliably detect fetal trisomies and that results are robust between runs and under suboptimal conditions. Low costs, ease of use, de creased run time, and robustness underline the suitability of the Wildfire for cost effective and rapid NIPT in clinical practice.",2014

For each protein fami ly a large amount of information that is extracted from protein structures, alignments and scientific literature, among others, is available. All this in formation is integrated and validated, and can be analysed via a number of different methods and tools. By intelligently combining all this heterogeneous information 3DM is able to provide state of the art predictions about the effects of genetic variations.

21957,"Background Cell free DNA (cfDNA) has emerged over the last year as an alternative for amniocenthesis for diagnosis of the common aneuploidies looking at trisomy 21, 13, 18, sex chromosomes and triploidy. Methods We present our experience of the first 300 PanoramaÃ¢ÂÂ¢ tests sent from Israel. This method is based on massively multiplexed PCR amplification of cfDNA isolated from maternal plasma, targeting 19,488 SNPs, followed by high throughput sequencing. The fetal fraction is determined. The SNP pattern of maternal DNA (from buffy coat) is compared to the SNP pattern of free DNA from maternal plasma, which contains maternal and fetal DNA. Paternal ge nomic samples, when available, were included in the analysis; in the absence of a paternal sample, the algorithm considers population allele frequencies. Combining the maximum likelihood ratio with a priori risk generates a risk score. Results The results of the first 300 sequential tests performed in Is rael were analyzed. Fifteen samples necessitated redraw, two samples failed analysis. Four samples yielded high risk scores: two cases for trisomy 21, one for Kleifelter syndrome (KS) (47,XXY) and one for trisomy 18. Confir mation of both trisomy 21 and one KS were done by CVS or amniocenthesis. The suspected trisomy 18 is in the process of confirmation. There are no known false negative results.

21959,"Technological advances in determination of human genetic sequence have significantly facilitated genetic diagnostics in human disorders at progressi vely diminishing costs. Due to interpretative and ethical challenges faced in medical reporting of findings in whole exome sequencing (WES), sequencing of arbitrarily defined gene panels is commonly endorsed in clinical practice. Such selection of clinical sequencing target, however, narrows the diagnostic survey to genes directly associated with proposed diagnosis, is not resistant to ambiguity in determination of patientsÃ¢ÂÂ diagnosis and suffers from large disparity in definitions of gene panels between diagnostic centres. The systematization of human phenotype annotation, notably with the Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) project now offers a possibility for for malized dissection of human phenotypic traits and offers a possibility for straightforward, systematic and individualised definition of clinical sequen cing target based on distinct patients phenotypic features. We therefore pro pose a novel approach to outlining the clinical sequencing target for diagno stic next generation sequencing, where patientÃ¢ÂÂs phenotype is first defined according to HPO nomenclature and according gene panel is then dynami cally constructed based on known phenotype gene associations. Proposed algorithm automatically scores genes based on their phenotypic compatibi lity with disease under evaluation and defines a tailored sequencing target based on specific phenotypic characterization of disease. We demonstrate that such an approach allows for judicious extension of currently established sequencing panels while assuring comparable power to establish genetic etiology and controlling for issues in either WES or tar geted panel sequencing approaches.",2014

The purpose of this study was to quantify the percentage of MCC that can be present in a fetal sample without compromising the fetal genotyping result in each of the different assays used for PND in this laboratory. Method: Maternal DNA carrying X linked and autosomal recessive disease was mixed with unaffected fetal DNA (prepared from dissected chorionic villi) in known proportions. Diagnostic methods examined included primer extension assays with detection by MALDI TOF mass spectrometry, gap PCR, MLPA, long range PCR and Sanger sequencing. STR analysis (AmpFlSTR Identifiler kit, Life Technologies) is routinely used in our laboratory to as sess MCC and was run in parallel with each assay to assess the theoretical versus the detectable MCC. Results and discussion : An unacceptable level of MCC was defined as the percentage of MCC that results in an equivocal or incorrect genotype in the fetus. This percentage of detectable MCC was assay dependent, ranging from 1.0% with the gap PCR, 10 15% for long range PCR, 15 20 % for Sanger Sequencing and 50% for MLPA. A correct genotyping result was obtained with the primer extension assay up to 20% MCC. STR analysis had a limit of detection of 1.0%, providing a useful tool for quantifying MCC. Results of this study have provided a basis for interpreting a PND result when MCC is present and advising requesting clinicians when repeat invasive procedure is warranted.",2014

Currently, the diagnosis of PCD involves the study of cilia morphology, motility and ultrastructure, nasal nitric oxide measurement and, more rarely, genetic analysis. This is mainly due to the high genetic heterogeneity of the disease which has been associated to mutations in 26 different genes. This study aims to improve the genetic diagnosis of PCD that it is routinely limited to a subset of the most frequently mutated genes.

Genomic era has improved a lot molecular diagnosis, but in the last five years the new revolution of next generation sequencing has open a new window not only on research but also on diagnostic testing. The scientific framework and the laboratory activities are completely changed: the number of known disease genes has increased exponentially, automation is now applied, certification and accreditation procedures are in place in a growing number of laboratories. Both public National Health systems and private laboratories or companies are facing with an increasing demand of genomic tests for the most common diseases. Correct information and awareness among public and all stakehol ders are crucial. Since it has not been clearly defined how many genomic tests have enough clinical utility, the investigation of their costs could be a way to establish a correct public health policy. Activity Based Costing is the methodology used to assigns the cost of each activity. The systematic analysis of activities needed to perform genetics tests has identified a number of indicators to assess the workload for every profes sional who participates in the process of diagnosis and the proportion of material used for each activity. All these parameters have been incorporated into a software able to split all the lab costs (personnel, material and gene ral costs) for each test provided in order to compare costs among different laboratories, to compare the performance of the same laboratory in subse quent years and to make a priority list of genetic/genomic tests to provide, taking into account costs/benefits data.",2014

To detect indel mutations in homopolymers is of great importance in order to implement the corresponding sequencing system into the routine clinical practice. To test the analytical performance of the pyrosequencing based GS Junior system in assessing homopolymer sequences, a series of plasmid vectors were generated using pcDNA3.1 as template. Altogether 12 clones were produced, 4 mer, 5 mer, and 6 mer homopolymers with all four nucleotides using site directed mutagenesis. Mutations were confirmed using Sanger sequencing. For the test system, each homopolymer tract was tested using three pairs of PCR/sequencing primers to test the hypothesis whether the beginning of the sequencing reaction might provide the neces sary signal to noise ratio to accurately test the size of the homopolymers. In the first, the forward, in the second, the reverse primer was located (i.e. the primerÃ¢ÂÂs 3Ã¢ÂÂ end) just next to the homopolymer to be analyzed, respectively.

On average, companies test for 4% (2,2% to 7%) of all known mutations on a particular gene (HGMD).Currently, commercial companies offer screening for around 20% of known recessively inherited diseases.

So far, a total of 9,471 patient and 3,348 parental samples have been tested by SNP array in our diagnostic laboratory. A (potentially) causative copy number variant (CNV) was detected in almost 27% of the patients and analysis of SNP genotypes revealed one or more significant stretches of homozygosity in an additional 8% of patients. Follow up testing by either gene mutation analysis or patient parent trio information analysis subsequently led to the respective identification of pathogenic mutations in recessive disease genes or uniparental disomies (UPD), thereby increasing the diagnostic yield with at least 1%. Using the SNP genotype information also improved the detec tion of mosaic imbalances and enabled us to detect clinically relevant, mo saic, copy neutral changes of homozygosity in four patients. A mosaic finding (CNV, aneuploidy or allelic imbalance) was detected in a further 26 patient samples and 10 parental samples, resulting in a dramatically increased re currence risk for these parents. The percentage of mosaicism often differed between tissues samples of mesodermal, ectodermal or endodermal origin from each of these individuals.

To overcome this problem we have incorporated a workflow that determines whether a variation is located on the maternal or the paternal allele in the patient. The workflow requires SNP array analysis to be done on maternal and patient DNA samples. If a variation is located on the maternal allele in the patient and the variation is not found in the maternal DNA sample, then the variation can be classified as de novo. Utilizing this workflow enhances the diagnostic value of variati ons found by SNP array, when paternal DNA is not available.",2014

The latter currently represents the most appropriate diagnostic procedure in case of peripheral lesions, such as adenocarcino mas, which account for almost 40 % of all NSCLCs and for the highest EGFR mutational rates. Two hundred and forty four patients carrying peripheral lung masses un derwent CT guided aspiration. The obtained material was split, and a part was addressed to conventional histopathological analysis while the remai ning one was stored at Ã¢ÂÂ20 ÃÂ°C. In case of confirmation of adenocarcinoma, tumor genomic DNA was extracted from both fresh and fixed material, and EGFR and KRAS sequencing was performed. We identified 136 adenocarcinomas; from 134, we could recover enough material for the study. A full match was demonstrated between EGFR/KRAS mutational prevalences through the two approaches tested. We found EGFR mutations in 13 patients (9.7 %); 7 were females and 11 never or former smokers. KRAS mutations occurred in 20 (14.9 %) patients. EGFR and KRAS mutations were mutually exclusive. Mutational screening on fresh cancer cells is an achievable, safe and cost effective procedure which might allow routinely tumor molecular profiling as powerful integration of conventional histopathological analysis.",2014
21972,"Whole exome sequencing (WES) allows the detection of a wide range of va riant types. With one single test it is possible to detect small variants (SNVs), and structural variation. Whilst the role of copy number variants (CNVs) in intellectual disability (ID) is well known, the role of CNVs in other diseases is less well studied, although it has been suggested that CNVs can be found in up to 10% of deafness patients. We have performed read depth WES CNV analysis on 600 patients across 5 heterogeneous disorders including ID, deafness, blindness, metabolic disorders, movement disorders. This analy sis revealed several clinically relevant CNVs exerting a dominant effect, as well as CNVs unmasking a recessive mutation that lead to pathogenic com pound heterozygous events. The cohort of 310 ID patients had previously screened negative for CNV microarray analysis as well as WES SNV analysis. Nonetheless clinically relevant CNVs were identified in 2% of patients. Sy stematic screening of the remaining patient groups identified CNVs in ~4% of individuals, including in COL6A1, EYS and deletions in USH2A . To further examine pathogenic structural variation, we performed whole genome se quencing on 50 patient parent trios. In 7 patients we identified pathogenic large variants, including two single exon deletions, a tandem duplication, an inter chromosomal duplication and one complex inversion/duplication/de letion event. Discordant reads provided positional information for duplica ted sequences identifying an in frame gene fusion. These results show that structural variation is not only an important cause of neurodevelopmental diseases but also a much broader range of genetic diseases.",2014
21973,"Skeletal dysplasias comprise a large group of more than 450 clinically di stinct and genetically heterogeneous diseases associated with mutations in more than 300 genes. Clinical and radiological findings are used to diagnose these diseases. However, due to the genetic heterogeneity of these disorders, the diagnostic process is complex. With the advances in molecular genetics and the elucidation of the molecular basis of these diseases, molecular tests have become useful in the diagnosis of these dysplasias. Since many diffe rent genes have been associated with these disorders, standard diagnostic approaches using Sanger sequencing can be expensive and time consuming. To overcome these limitations, we used targeted exome sequencing and de signed an 1.4Mb panel for simultaneous testing of more than 4800 exons in 309 genes involved in skeletal dysplasias, and 28 genomic regions which when deleted are associated with these diseases. DNA from 96 individuals with previous clinical diagnosis of skeletal dysplasia was sequenced in 8 multiplexed runs using an Illumina MiSeq sequencer. Reproducibility was tested by repeating the entire procedure for three patients. NGS of the cap tured exons resulted in an average coverage of 140X. Causative mutations were characterized in 13 patients so far including de novo mutations in 7 cases. Analysis of the rest of the data is ongoing. Confirmation with Sanger sequencing was performed for these variants and all were confirmed. Our NGS panel provides a fast, accurate and cost effective molecular diagnostic tool and can assist in the diagnosis of genetically heterogeneous diseases like skeletal diseases.

This makes conventional molecular testing arduous. We decided to develop a targeted next generation sequencing kit for diagno sis purpose. We tested two enrichment approaches of 10 SPG genes: one using amplicons (Illumina, TruSeq Custom Amplicon TSCA) on 48 patients, and the other using capture (Roche NimbleGen, SeqCap EZ) on 60 patients. Sequencing was performed on the MiSeq (Illumina). Coverage and variant distribution were evaluated using the Genomics Workbench software (CLC Bio). After read mapping on whole genome (Hg19), the mean coverage per pati ent varied from 444X (sd 98X) for SeqCap EZ, to 587X (sd 127X) for TSCA. However, the percent of regions with minimal coverage <30X was <15% with SeqCap EZ, and decreased to <5% when the patient mean coverage re ached 600X. With TSCA, this value was stable (15 20%). We then compared the variants. Those reported in dbSNP137 were similar on both strategies. Concerning variants unknown in dbSNP137, 16 20 vari ants with TSCA vs 0 3 with SeqCap EZ were obtained per sample. This was explained by an enrichment of variants in some amplicons in TSCA sugge sting false positives due to Taq polymerase errors. SeqCap EZ was finally chosen to enrich our targets. We designed a new pa nel with 74 SPG genes, which gave <0.7% of regions with minimal coverage <30X.

21975,"Beta thalassemia is one of most common autosomal recessive disorders worldwide. The high prevalence (8%) and heterogeneity in molecular level, observed in Greece, makes necessary the development of a reliable, cost ef fective and rapid scanning method for ÃÂ² globin gene analysis, easily adapted to a routine laboratory. Here we describe the development of a beta thalassaemia specific High Re solution Melting Analysis (HRMA) approach, in order to identify point mu tations and small insertions or deletions of the beta globin (HBB) gene and substitute previously applied techniques (DGGE analysis, Sanger sequen cing).Specific sets of primers were designed to cover eight overlapping regions of the HBB gene containing the hitherto reported mutations of the Hellenic population. PCR conditions were identical for all amplicons, permitting thus multiplexing. Amplicons cover part of the HBB promoter region and the CDS region, except from the central part of IVS II where practically no mutations has been reported up to now. Initially, 150 previously genotyped samples were analysed. Different muta tions produced distinct derivative plots when subtracted from the reference curve of a wild type control, resulting in 100% accurate mutation identifica tion. In addition, HRMA analysis of 48 undefined samples totally matched subsequent diagnosis by either Sanger sequencing or DGGE analysis. The described HRMA assay represents a rapid, simple, cost effective and highly feasible strategy for identifying effectively underlying mutations of beta thalassemia. The reported method is amenable to high throughput sy stems and except from being highly specific and sensitive, does not require any post PCR analysis.",2014
21976,"Around birth, a shift from ÃÂ³ to ÃÂ² globin gene expression causes a switch from foetal haemoglobin (HbF) to adult haemoglobin (HbA). Residual amounts of HbF are synthesized throughout life F erythrocytes. Increased HbF levels ameliorate symptoms of ÃÂ² haemoglobinopathies. KrÃÂ¼ppel like factor 1 (KLF1) plays a central role in the developmental glo bin gene switch; carriers of KLF1 mutations have hereditary persistence of foetal haemoglobin (HPFH) and show variably elevated (10 40%) HbF. This variation may be due to differential expression of other modifier genes. The KLF1 interactome can be further defined by identifying potential molecular targets and observing their expression at the cellular level in comparison with HbF expression and distribution in F cells. The mean corpuscular HbF (MCHbF) is normally estimated by dividing the amount of HbF, determined by HPLC, by the number of F cells, obtained by flow cytometry. Since HbF may be unequally distributed among F cells, an imaging cytometry protocol enables quantification of HbF per F cell by fluo rescent emission measurements. Protocols presented in the literature were found lacking in efficacy, mostly due to inefficient fixation and high degree of autofluorescence. A new intracellular anti HbF antibody labelling technique was thus optimized for use with the Nikon Eclipse Ti inverted fluorescence microscope. This technique resulted in images of superior quality from which the MCHbF could be determined for each F cell observed. This proto col will be used to study the association of KLF1 and other genes, obtained through NGS data analyses, with MCHbF in normal and HPFH individuals, to identify new therapeutic targets for ÃÂ² haemoglobinopathies.",2014

The panel covers TP53 coding regions comprehensively using optimized primers to minimize off target sequencing. It is comprised of 24 primer pairs across 2 pools requiring only 20 ng of DNA. The design of short amplicons of 125 to 175 bp permits the amplification of DNA starting from formalin fixed paraffin embedded material. We verified the panel on 30 breast cancer samples previously characterized with Sanger sequencing. Sequencing re actions were carried out with the Ion PGMÃ¢ÂÂ¢ Sequencer on Ion 318Ã¢ÂÂ¢ chip. The average % of mapped reads on target was of 96,8% and average depth of coverage 20,386X.

Among the different subtypes of breast cancer, triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) needs a special attention due to its limitations in therapy and to its aggressiveness. Several studies have tried to identify different new mutation both in oncogenes and tumor suppressor gene in order to explain these limitations of TNBC treatment. The present study was aimed at the identification of mutations in 46 genes involved in cancer in 31 patients with TNBC operated at the Institute of On cology Ã¢ÂÂProf. Dr. I.

Utility of preserved um bilical cords have been demonstrated in several occasions, but it remains unclear how long the mummified umbilicus can preserve genomic DNA that tolerates sequence based genetic analysis. We report a Japanese family of successive early deaths presumably due to clinically diagnosed ornithine carbamoyltransferase deficiency. The exact molecular pathology, c. 394T>C (p.

This observation illustrates the striking stability of DNA preserved in mummified umbilicus, and supports an efficient way of genetic sample preservation. From cultu ral standpoint, preservation of mummified umbilical cord is a unique but common tradition in Japan for at least several centuries. The exact molecu lar diagnosis of this X linked inborn error of metabolism of the urea cycle had an significant impact on the affected family. Hemizygous female carriers are at risk of hyperammonemic crisis, and this disorder is treatable with supplemental dietary interventions.

21981,"Introduction Unclassified variants (UVs) are a common finding in DNA dia gnostic testing. The introduction of next generation sequencing, allowing the simultaneous analysis of multiple genes, has enhanced the problem of variants with unknown clinical significance. For in vitro functional testing of UVs we need cells that express the specific gene. Aim The aim of this study is to use direct trans differentiation of skin fibroblasts into smooth muscle cell (SMC) phenotype in order to study the effect of UVs in genes that are involved in susceptibility to thoracic aortic aneurysms. Methods We used culture media with horse serum and TGFÃÂ²1 to induce trans differentiation of patientsÃ¢ÂÂ fibroblasts into SMCs. Gene expression was tested with RT PCR. Splice errors were studied on cDNA. Contraction of the cells was studied on collagen matrix. Results Cells with SMC phenotype, derived from fibro blasts from patients with UVÃ¢ÂÂs in MYH11 were compared to controls. The differentiated cells expressed SMC markers, including MYH11, confirming successful differentiation. An intronic mutation in MYH11, c.3879+2dup, in a patient with TAA and type B dissection with a positive family history for aortic dissection, does not affect the canonical splice donor site, but was shown in transdifferentiated cells from the patient to result in the use of a cryptic splice site in exon 29, resulting in an in frame deletion of 78 bases. The contraction of the patient derived cells was disturbed compared to con trol cells.

Usher Syndrome (USH) is characterized by phenotypic and allelic hetero geneity requiring a powerful and reliable molecular diagnosis. Thus, a tar geted re sequencing (TS) panel of the 10 USH genes has been developed. It covers 96% of the targeted regions being characterized by 872 amplicons using Ion Torrent TM technology (Life Technologies). This protocol has been applied to the analysis of 30 USH cases divided as follows: 16 with alrea dy known mutations were used for a validation step which demonstrated 100% accuracy, while the remaining 14 were analyzed at diagnostic level. The combination of systematic data analysis using an established bioinfor matics pipeline followed by Sanger sequencing confirmation and segrega tion analysis led to the identification of 15 novel variants (1 in USH2A , 4 in PCDH15, 1 in MYO7A, 3 in CDH23 , 4 in GPR98 , 2 in USH1G ). All these variants were predicted as pathogenic using several in silico predictor tools such as Mutation Taster, Polyphen 2, SIFT and others. Five known pathogenetic mu tations were also detected.

As gene regulation is a fundamental process, the analysis of transcript profiles and genomes of single cells to dissect phenotypic variability is of key interest to scientists. Deep genome and transcriptome analysis of small biological samples using next generation sequencing (NGS) is often limited by the small amount of sample available (6 pg gDNA and 0.5 pg mRNA/human cell). We developed two new methods for whole genome amplification (WGA) and whole tran scriptome amplification (WTA), based on Multiple Displacement Amplifica tion (MDA) technology, from small samples down to just a single cell. Parallel WGA and WTA reactions begin with lysis of 25Ã¢ÂÂ1000 cells from the same sample. Both reactions include a ligation and multiple displacement amplification (MDA) reaction. This results in amplification products (WGA DNA, WTA cDNA) of the highest comparability and can be used for compara tive studies of the genome and transcriptome from the same sample. The second method (WTA) amplifies RNA from 1Ã¢ÂÂ1000 cells directly and includes an efficient lysis, cDNA synthesis, and amplification strategy that results in minimal bias and errors. gDNA is effectively removed to prevent false positive results.

Method: We are assembling a bio bank of patients with selected ADRs that are identified from the nationwide ADR reporting system or referred directly from collaborating physicians. Consenting patients are interviewed concerning medical and drug history, and supplementary information is collected from medical records. A blood sample for genomic testing is drawn and kept until a sufficient number of cases are available for genome wide analyses. We are collecting generalised ADRs, e.g. liver reactions, severe skin reactions and agranulocytosis, and drug specific ADRs, e.g. angioedema and cough related to ACE inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers and statin induced myopathy. We have 5000 unrelated controls with genome wide data from the Swedish Twin Registry. From this cohort it is possible to select treated controls, i.e. twins that have been prescribed a drug without being diagnosed with the ADR in question. Results: Swedegene started in 2010 and currently has >1600 cases with DNA and complete phenotypes. We have promising, but inconclusive, geno me wide results for three of the ADR diagnoses.

Blood was collected at baseline (0 min) and on 11 subsequent occasions until 480 min after the test breakfast. Plasma total (TC), low density lipoprotein (LDL C) and high density (HDL C) cholesterol, triacylglycerol, insulin and glucose was determined. There was a significant impact of APOB insertion/deletion polymorphism (rs17240441) on fasting TC (P,0.003), LDL C (P,0.003), HDL C (P,0.0004), triacylglycerol (P,0.003) and insulin (P,0.003) with higher concentrations in the deletion allele car riers. A significantly higher area under the time response curve was evident for the triacylglycerol (P,1x10 6) and insulin (P,0.006) response in the de letion allele carriers (n,93) relative to the insertion/insertion homozygotes (n,52).Our findings indicate that the APOB polymorphism is likely to be an important genetic determinant of the large inter individual variability in the postprandial response to dietary fat intake. Greater understanding of how APOB gene influences postprandial lipaemia will advance the prospects for personalised nutrition, where the deletion allele carriers may benefit from personalized dietary strategies to reduce the marked lipaemia in response to meal ingestion.",2014

DFX pharmacokinetic has been related with response to therapy. This drug is metabolized in liver by UDP glucuronyltransferase (UGT) 1A1 and 1A3, by cytochrome P450 (CYP) 1A1, 1A2 and 2D6 enzymes, and it is eliminated via biliary enteric circulati on through multidrug resistance protein 2 (MRP2 ). Our aim was to evaluate DFX plasma concentrations according to single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in genes involved in this drug metabo lism and elimination, in a cohort of non paediatric ÃÂ² thalassemic patients. Further aim was to define a plasma concentration cut off value predicting an adequate response to therapy. DFX concentrations were determined from plasma samples obtained at the end of dosing interval (C trough) using an HPLC UV method. Allelic discrimi nation for SNPs in UGT1A1, UGT1A3, CYP1A1, CYP1A2, CYP2D6, MRP2 and BCRP1 genes was performed by real time PCR.

Background The ÃÂ² adrenergic receptors (ADRB) are expressed in the ci liary body and trabecular meshwork, structures involved in aqueous humor production and outflow, respectively. ADRB are members of the adrenergic family of G protein coupled receptors. Topic ÃÂ² blockers have a good local and systemic tolerance; they reduce the aqueous humor production and eye strain blocking the ADRB of the ciliary body and interfering with adenylate cyclase. However, the ocular hypotensive response is not the same in all patients and could be mediated by the polymorphisms of the ADRB genes.

21995,"Clopidogrel is an effective inhibitor of platelet aggregation due to its selective and irreversible blockade of the P2Y12 receptor on platelet cell membranes. Antiplatelet treatment with clopidogrel and aspirin is a recommended pro cedure for the reduction of stent thrombosis and a vital strategy for patients undergoing percutaneous coronary interventions. It has been demonstrated that clopidogrel does not exert an antiplatelet effect in a certain proportion of patients in many studies, known as clopidogrel resistance. In order to research the exact mechanism of clopidogrel resistance, we ai med to determine whether there is the impact of CYP2C19, CYP3A4, CYP2B6, ABCB1, ITGB3 and PON1 gene variants on the antiplatelet effect of clopido grel in Turkish patients. We evaluated on 223 Turkish patients with acute coronary syndrome underwent percutaneous coronary intervention with stent implantation. Platelet reactivity (PRU) and % inhibition were measu red with VerifyNow P2Y12 assay in blood samples collected from patients that took a standard dose of clopidogrel (75 mg/day) for at least 7 days. 12 genetic variants were genotyped using the Sequenom MassARRAY system. The PRU and % inhibition values of the genotypes were compared stati stically. The CYP2C19*2 (G636A) single nucleotide polymorphism was as sociated with a reduced antiplatelet response (p<0.001). Conversely, the CYP2C19*17 (C806T) single nucleotide polymorphism was associated with an enhanced antiplatelet effect (p,0.025). There was no statistically signi ficant difference between the PRU and % inhibition values of the other ge netic variant genotypes.

As potential circulating biomarker, expression pattern of miR 155 can be determined from blood and may discriminate BC patients from healthy individuals, report on treatment efficacy and further progno sis. Development of BC may be a consequence of BRCA1 tumor suppressor gene mutations involved in DNA damage response and repair. BRCA1 epi genetically controls miR 155 expression and its pro cancerous potential. In this study, we evaluated expression levels of miR 155 in circulation of indi viduals carrying BRCA1 mutations with no disease manifestation as well as in BRCA1 BC patients after tumor resection and therapy. We determined miR 155 expression in lymphocytes and plasma from pe ripheral blood. To amplify mature form, we used qRT PCR with 1 RT and 2 qPCR specifically designed primers. Similarly, we determined expression levels of miR 17, miR 18a, miR 21 and miR 27a, also known to be involved in BC pathogenesis. Compared to healthy controls, individuals carrying BRCA1 mutations with no disease manifestation displayed an increased miR 155 expression in plasma, but not in lymphocytes. In BRCA1 BC patients, we observed signi ficantly elevated miR 155 expression in both, separated lymphocytes and plasma, a phenomenon that persisted after tumor resection and therapy. Other studied miRNAs were also deregulated. Our results point to epigenetic control of miR 155 by BRCA1 in wide time scale.

21997,"CYP1A2 enzyme contributes to biotransformation of wide range of thera peutically important drugs, including caffeine, clopidogrel, clozapine, war farin, procarcinogens and endogenous substrates. The purpose of this study was to determine and describe the pharmacogenetic profile and interethnic differences of variants of CYP1A2 gene between Roma and Hungarian popu lation. From genomic DNA, 404 Roma and 396 Hungarian healthy subjects were genotyped for two non coding variants of CYP1A2, namely 163C>A (*1F) and 3860G>A (*1C). Polymerase chain reaction restriction fragment length po lymorphism (PCR RFLP) technique was applied. The minor allele frequency for CYP1A2*1C variant was significantly different between Hungarian and Roma samples (2.02% vs. 0%, p<0.001). The AA homozygous genotype was not detectable. For CYP1A2*1F polymorphism we found a remarkable dif ferences in presence of AA genotype in Roma population compared to Hun garians (31.9% vs. 49.5%, p<0.001) and in minor allele frequency (56.9% vs. 68.6%, p,0.025). The following CYP1A2 genotypes were identified in Roma and Hungarian samples, respectively: *1A/*1A (18.1% vs. 12.4%), *1A/*1F (50% vs. 36.9%), *1F/*1F (31.9% vs. 46.7%). In Hungarian po pulation we found the *1C/*1F genotype (4.04%), but it was not present in Roma subjects. In conclusion, analysis of distribution of CYP1A2 gene variants revealed further pharmacogenetic differences between Roma and Hungarian population samples.

Polymorphisms in CYP2C9 have been previously found to be associated with observed warfarin dose variability in different populations, but not in Caribbean Hispanics. Carib bean Hispanics originated as a result of a complex admixture among Cau casians, Africans and Amerindians ancestors a characteristic that should be considered for warfarin management. The rare loss of function CYP2C9*8 allelic variant is reportedly more prevalent among individuals with Afri can heritage. Since Puerto Ricans has a significant contribution of African ancestry in their genetic backgrounds, this cross sectional study was aimed to determine the frequency of CYP2C9*8 in a cohort of 150 Puerto Rican patients undergoing warfarin therapy. DNA specimens were extracted and genotyped for the CYP2C9*8 using a PCR based Taqman genotyping assay. We found 3 heterozygous for the CYP2C9*8 variant in our study cohort, cor responding to a minor allele frequency of 1% (95%CI: 0.0026 0.031). The observed frequency met Hardy Weinberg equilibrium. Allele frequency in our cohort was found to be significantly lower than that from a previous report in African Americans (0.01 versus 0.047, respectively, p,0.045 by two tailed z test), with a carrier frequency of 1 in 50 (Puerto Ricans) ver sus 1 in 11 (African Americans).

For this a stepwise treatment approach is used in which metformin is the first treatment step. Unfortunately the glycaemic re sponse to metformin is highly variable between individuals with a large pro portion of patients unable to reach the treatment target, defined as glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c)<53mmol. Genetic factors appeared to be involved in the variability in metformin treatment response (h 2,0.36).

The number of peaks in intergenic regions is roughly 50 to 55% while depending on the cell type 30 to 40% of the peaks are localized in introns. Some of the genes may have several intronic binding sites. Intronic binding sites are most likely to regulate their own genes, therefore based on these statistics and the individual assignment of the binding sites to their genomic locations, we have identified a set of genes that have ER binding si tes in their introns.

FSHR polymorphism 29 G>A and Asn680 Ser alone, are not associated to different concentration of FSH. Combined analysis of the three polymorphisms again highlights that the major deter minant in FSH levels is 211 G>T polymorphism, but shows also that this effect is modulated by 29 G>A polymorphism, as subjects with 211 GG/ 29 GG genotype have higher FSH level. Total sperm count and testicular volu me is also modulated by the genotype: Homozygotes 211 TT are invariably azoo oligozoospermic with a reduced testicular volume and FSH <8 UI/L. Combined effect of Asn680Ser is negligible.

Its content is adapted to characteristics of Russian population.9.5% of 213 genotyped patients were diagnosed to have monogenic disease (table 1). 60% appeared to be heterozygous carriers of 1 3 mutations (table 2). Thus using of microarray Ã¢ÂÂEthnogeneÃ¢ÂÂ helps to reveal carrier status among couples planning pregnancy and to understand real frequencies of monoge nic disorders in general population of Russia. Early detection of disorders in asymptomatic patients allows preventing severe complications by prescri bing pathogenic therapy. Table 1.

22011,"Background: The contribution of MS loci on familial aggregation for MS or other autoimmune diseases is still unclear. Objective: The aim is to investigate the role of MS associated genetic variants in explaining the familial aggregation for MS or other autoimmune diseases, by comparing sporadic and familial MS cases of Italian origin. Methods: genetic and familial aggregation data were available on 572 MS patients (474 sporadic cases and 98 familial cases). A weighted genetic risk score (wGRS), based on 106 SNPs found to be associated to MS according to the Immunochip project, was calculated. Results: we did not observe a difference in terms of wGRS between spora dic and familial cases of MS (10.67ÃÂ±0.038 vs 10.62ÃÂ±0.093). However, when assessing the impact of the known MS loci on the aggregation for MS and other autoimmune diseases, we observed that there is a statistically si gnificant difference between sporadic and familial cases (10.71ÃÂ±0.046 vs 10.56ÃÂ±0.066, p<0.05). Moreover, it appears that males with other cases of MS or autoimmune diseases in the family have a higher wGRS compared to females (10.81ÃÂ±0.120 vs 10.45ÃÂ±0.078, p,0.02).Conclusions: our data suggest that known MS genetic variants may have a role in explaining the aggregation for MS and other autoimmune diseases; this is in agreement with the fact that most of these loci are involved in im munological functions. When stratifying by gender, it appears that the ge netic variants have a stronger impact in males, suggesting that probably in females other factors are involved, like hormones or other environmental causes.",2014
22012,"Background: Previous pharmacogenomic studies conducted in Interferon beta (IFN) treated Multiple Sclerosis (MS) patients explored the influence of genetic variants on the short term response to the drug. The aim of this study is to perform a genome wide association study (GWAS) of long term response to Interferon beta observed using a follow up period of 4 years after drug start. Methods: The GWAS study was conducted using the Omni express Illumi ABSTRACTS POSTERS ESHG 2014 | MILAN, ITALY | WWW. ESHG. ORG 302Back to inde x naÃÂ® array on a cohort of 329 IFN beta treated MS patients followed for 4 years of treatment. We used three different outcome measures of response to treatment: a disability criterion, measured as the increase of Ã¢ÂÂ¥1 point at Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS), and two composite criteria, which take into account measures of disability progression and relapse occurrence (Ã¢ÂÂ¥2), on which separate GWAS analyses have been performed. Results: No genome wide significant association signal was detected. When using a cut off p value of 10 4, 42 SNPs emerged as associated according to the disability criterion, while 28 and 41 SNPs for the two composite criteria. A modest overlap (11.8%) was observed among associations across three phenotypes. Conclusions: Our study showed new targets potentially involved in the mo dulation of the response to IFN beta treatment. An in silico replication ana lyses on identified targets is planned on an independent cohort of treated MS patients.",2014
22013,"Biological therapy using fully humanized monoclonal antibodies against TNF ÃÂ± (adalimumab) is efficiently used to induce and maintain remission in around 70% of Crohn disease (CD) patients not responding to standard treatment or developing adverse drug effects to corticosteroids. We inve stigated if single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) contributing to CD risk could help to predict the response to adalimumab (ADA) treatment in CD patients. We used IBDQ index and biological biomarkers (CRP levels) to mo nitor therapy response after 4, 12, 20 and 30 weeks after first treatment with adalimumab. The strongest association between CRP levels and treat ment with ADA was found for ATG16L1 SNP rs10210302. After 12 weeks of treatment 85% of patients with CT or TT genotype in rs10210302 had a po sitive response (drop of CRP to normal levels or by more than 25%) to treat ment with ADA compared to 37,5% of patients with CC genotype (p,8,11E 04). We also found significant associations between SNP rs10512734 loca ted near PTGER4 gene and ADA treatment response measured with both, IBDQ index and biological response measured with CRP . Average increase in IBDQ index (delta IBDQ) after 12 weeks of treatment was higher in the group of patients with GG genotype for SNP rs10512734 (47,6) compared to those with AA or AG genotype (17,4, p,7,06E 03). Additional SNPs in 6 out of 33 tested CD associated genes (CASP 9, IL27,C11orf30, CCNY, IL13) showed suggestive association with ADA response. Our results suggest ADA response in CD patients in partially genetically predisposed by SNPs in CD risk genes.",2014
22014,"Psoriasis is a chronic, inflammatory skin disorder affecting 2 3% of the po pulation worldwide. While there are a large number of effective modalities for treating psoriasis, response to therapy varies among patients which could be due to genetic factors. Cyclosporine is considered to be a cost ef fective first line systemic therapy for psoriasis, however the response rate is around 60 70%. The aim of the present study, which is based on a Greek multi centre collaboration, was to target ABCB1, which encodes for P glyco protein, by selecting polymorphisms that could influence the absorption and disposition of P glycoprotein substrate drugs like cyclosporine. In detail, T 129C (rs3213619), G1199A (rs2229109), C1236T (rs1128503), G2677T (rs2032582) and C3435T (rs1045642) polymorphisms were selected as candidate markers of response to cyclosporine treatment after 3 months of therapy and genotyped in 84 psoriasis patients under cyclosporine the rapy. Fifty two patients (62%) were defined as responders (ÃÂPASI Ã¢ÂÂ¥75%) and thirty two (38%) as non responders (ÃÂPASI Ã¢ÂÂ¤50%). Single SNP and ha plotype construction showed that the haplotype for marker C3435T could account for the prediction of ~20% of the non responders to cyclosporine therapy. Notwithstanding the importance of this finding, there is a remai ning 80% to be identified, which could be illuminated by systems network analysis, whereby additional pharmacogenetic targets that may be involved in cyclosporine transport, processing or metabolism are identified. Overall, systems biology coupled with experimental validation of specific markers in large independent cohorts could lead in the creation of a molecular al gorithm for the prognosis of psoriasis patientsÃ¢ÂÂ response to cyclosporine as well as for other therapies.",2014

Increasing evidence supports the role of genetic variants in the develop ment of radio induced toxicity. Therefore, we performed a three stage ge nome wide association study that involved a Spanish cohort of 741 prostate cancer patients treated with radiotherapy to identify new susceptibility loci. The replication cohorts consisted of 633 prostate cancer patients from the UK, and 368 prostate cancer patients from a North American Caucasian co hort. Standardized total average toxicity (STAT) scores were derived from indivi dual toxicity endpoints to assess overall acute and late toxicities. Association tests of genotype with STAT acute or STAT late scores were performed with linear regression. Residuals from multivariate linear regression models, in cluding associated non genetic covariates, were calculated for each patient to quantify the toxicity not accounted for by the available non genetic cova riates. To obtain per allele ORs by logistic regression, patients were dichoto mized as Ã¢ÂÂ¤ or > than 1 standard deviation of the acute and late residuals. Seven and 42 loci were associated (P valueÃ¢ÂÂ¤10 5) with overall acute and late toxicity, respectively. Only one locus associated with overall late toxici ty, 2q24.1 (STATlate P value ,6.85x10 9; OR,6.67, 95%CI: 2.25 19.80) was replicated in the UK cohort (STATlate P value,2.08x10 4, OR,6.17, 95%CI: 2.25 16.95; meta analysis P value,4.16x10 10). The inclusion of the third ABSTRACTS POSTERS ESHG 2014 | MILAN, ITALY | WWW. ESHG. ORG 303Back to inde x cohort gave a meta analysis P value,4.64x10 11.

22016,"Methotrexate (MTX) is an anti rheumatic drug used in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). However, side events are present in 40% of the patients. The aim of this study was to determine the impact of genetic polymorphisms of 5, 10 methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR C677T and A1298C), Dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR 19 base pair deletion allele), thymidylate synthase (TYMS 2RÃ¢ÂÂ3R), methionine synthase (MTR A2756G) and methio nine synthase reductase (MTRR A66G) in a group of 143 Tunisian RA pati ents and evaluate its association with MTX toxicity. Patients who experienced MTX adverse events were defined Ã¢ÂÂwith toxicityÃ¢ÂÂ, those who did not, as Ã¢ÂÂwithout toxicityÃ¢ÂÂ. Genotyping was performed using PCR and PCR RFLP method. Demographic and clinical characteristics were obtained and MTX related adverse effects were recorded. Allele and geno type association were performed using chi2 test , genotype relative risk (GRR) and Odds ratio (OR). The regression logistic was also used to inve stigate the correlation between patient characteristics (MTX dose, duration of treatment, disease duration, age, sex, route of MTX administration) and toxicity. The analysis highlighted a significant genotypic association of MTHFR C677T polymorphism with increased MTX toxicity [p,0.004], and the strongest as sociation was shown in the T/T genotype [p,0.006]. However, The MTHFR A1298C , DHFR 19 base pair deletion allele and MTR A2756G polymorphis ms were not associated with increased MTX toxicity. While TYMS 2RÃ¢ÂÂ3R polymorphism had a protective effect on overall MTX toxicity [p,0.038]Moreover, our results revealed a positive correlation of both dose and route of administration of MTX with toxicity in RA patients (p,0.027; p, 0.004) respectively.",2014

22018,"Nevirapine (NVP) is a non nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor, wide ly prescribed for type 1 human immunodeficiency virus infection. A small proportion of individuals treated with NVP experience very severe cuta neous adverse events, including Stevens Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN).In the last years TRAF3IP2 gene variants were associated with susceptibili ty to psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus and cuta neous manifestations in inflammatory bowel disease. We hypothesized that this gene, involved in immune response and in NF KB activation, could be also implicated in the SJS/TEN susceptibility. To verify our hypothesis we performed a full resequencing of TRAF3IP2 gene in a population of patients treated with NVP . Twenty seven patients with NVP induced SJS/TEN and 78 controls, all from Mozambique, were enrolled. All ten exons of TRAF3IP2 gene, including the intron/exon boun daries, were analyzed by direct sequencing. We performed a case/control association analysis and a multivariate logistic analysis. We identified 8 exonic and 3 intronic variants. We did not find any novel variations. The case/control association analysis highlighted an association between the rs76228616 SNP in exon 2 and the SJS/TEN susceptibility. In particular the variant allele ( C ) was more present in SJS/TEN patients than in controls, resulting significantly associated with a higher risk to develop SJS/TEN (P,0.012 and OR,3.65 [95% CI 1.33 10.01]). A multivariate analy sis by logistic regression confirmed the significant involvement of TRAF3IP2 (rs76228616) in the susceptibility to SJS/TEN (P,0.027). Of course, further studies on larger samples and replications in other African populations are necessary to confirm our results.",2014
22019,Colorectal cancer (CRC) is amongst the top three most commonly diagnosed cancer in the world. Majority of these patients require treatment for meta static CRC since a third are at stage IV during diagnosis and another third of the Ã¢ÂÂcurativelyÃ¢ÂÂ resected patients (Stages I III) will relapse. 5 fluorouracil is a common drug used for the treatment of CRC but the response rate to this drug either alone or in combination is less than 40%. Developing a reliable biomarker that can predict response can facilitate the appropriate tailoring of treatment for these patients. Here we report a novel potentially functional Single Nucleotide Polymor phism (pfSNP) approach to identify SNPs predictive of response to 5 FU in Chinese metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC) patients. 1547 pfSNPs and one variable number tandem repeat (VNTR) in 139 genes in 5 FU drug (both PK and PD pathway) and colorectal cancer disease pathways were exami ned in 2 groups of CRC patients. Shrinkage of liver metastasis measured by RECIST criteria was used as the clinical end point. We identified a total of 9 novel pfSNPs including 4 non responder specific pfSNPs with potential functional significance that may be able to distinguish non responders from responders to 5 FU. These may thus serve as good biomarkers for response to 5 FU.,2014
22020,"Tacrolimus (Tac; FK 506) is an immunosuppressive drug used to avoid the rejection of solid organs. Tac has a narrow therapeutic range and a high in terindividual variability in dose requirements. Previous studies have linked common CYP3A4 3A5 and ABCB1 (MDR 1) polymorphisms to Tac dose re quirements (CYP3A5*3, CYP3A4*1B, CYP3A4*22, C3435T). Our aim was to identify new rare CYP3A5, CYP3A4 and ABCB1 variants that could influence Tac dose through massive parallel sequencing with the Ion Torrent PGM. We created three pools of 75 patients who differed in Tac dosage. The coding exons of the 3 genes were amplified in only two tubes with a custom Ampli seq, and the three pool reactions bar coded, library amplified, and sequen ced in a semiconductor PGM 318 array. These pooling + multiplex approach would facilitate the rapid screening of the three genes at a low cost and with minimum labor requirements. We identified several rare variants in CYP3A5 and CYP3A4 (P405T in CYP3A5, and S195P and I193S CYP3A4 new, non re ported). These missense changes could affect protein function. No missense ABCB1 variants were found. In conclusion, we identified new variants in CYP3A5 and CYP3A4 that could have an effect on Tac dose requirements.

22021,"Transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF B1) is a key mediator in asthma airway inflammation and remodelling. Leukotriene receptor antagonists are among the most prescribed drugs for asthma management. They decrease the level of inflammation in asthmatic airways and inhibit the expression of the TGF B1. The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of the most common polymorphism in the TGF B1 gene, 509C>T , on the response to montelukast in childhood asthma. Response to montelukast was tested in an ex vivo experiment using induced sputum cells from six children (five girls and a boy, age 7 18 years) previously genotyped for TGF B1 509C>T polymorphism. The cells isolated from 1mL of induced sputum were incuba ted with and without montelukast (50nmol) and the levels of TGF B1 were measured by a commercial enzyme linked immunosorbent assay kit. In all six cases after the treatment with montelukast a decreased TGF B1 levels in sputum were observed. Although the differences were not statistically signi ficant, the decrease in TGF B1 levels was different in carriers of different ge notypes: CC 738ÃÂ±107pg/mL, CT 1439ÃÂ±616pg/mL, and TT 397ÃÂ±187pg/ mL. Although preliminary, the results of this study indicate that the TGF B1 gene promoter polymorphisms may influence response to leukotriene re ceptor antagonists in childhood asthma. This finding should be confirmed in a larger cohort of patients and the effect of other polymorphisms should also be investigated. Ex vivo stimulation of sputum cells may be further de veloped into a test for assessment of individual response to asthma medica tions and potentially used as personalized medicine tool.",2014
22022,"Personalised medicine offers the prospect of treating genetic conditions using novel molecular methods, and our current research seeks to establish a viable treatment for Lattice Corneal Dystrophy Type I (LCDI) using muta tion specific short interfering RNAs (siRNAs).Corneal dystrophies comprise a group of debilitating hereditary disorders. Most of these conditions are inherited autosomal dominantly and caused by deleterious missense mutations. To date our group has focused on two corneal disorders; MeesmannÃ¢ÂÂs Epithelial Corneal Dystrophy (MECD) and Lattice Corneal Dystrophy type I (LCDI), which are caused by mutations in the KRT12 and TGFBI genes, respectively. The primary focus of this research was to develop a lead siRNA targeting the TGFBI Arg124Cys mutation, the most common cause of LCDI. A panel of 19 mutation specific siRNAs was assessed to select lead candi date siRNAs using a high throughput dual luciferase reporter assay and pyrosequencing to determine the lead siRNA. Potency and allele specificity of the lead siRNA was assessed in corneal epithelial cells isolated from a patient with a TGFBI Arg124Cys mutation, using pyrosequencing, qRT PCR and a TGFBI ELISA. Treatment with this siRNA resulted in a 44% reduc tion (p<0.01) of the endogenous Arg124Cys allele in this ex vivo model of LCDI, and was without effect on the wild type allele, demonstrating allele specificity. This research confirms the potential of siRNA therapeutics as a personalised medicine approach for the management of heritable TGFBI associated corneal dystrophies and opens the prospect for the translation of this technique to the treatment of other corneal dystrophies.",2014

Asthma is a complex trait with a large phenotypic diversity for which more than 300 genes have already been associated. In order to better define the heritability of the disease, Ã¢ÂÂomicsÃ¢ÂÂ technologies were used in several stu dies to explore genetic and epigenetic factors. The large amount of results obtained with these methods comes with complications for identifying true genes of interest. This study aims to compare genome wide associa tion studies (GWASs) and epigenome wide association studies (EWASs) of asthma and related phenotypes (atopy and allergic asthma) using a well described asthma familial collection in order to identify loci and genes of interest. GWASs and EWASs were performed on DNA samples extracted from whole blood and EWASs were also performed on DNA extracted from isolated eosinophils. GWASs were analyzed using a quasi likelihood score test performed using the MQLS program and EWASs data were compared using a Mann Whitney analysis implemented in the GenomeStudio software by Illumina. Analyses allow identifying 2 common loci between EWAS and GWAS analyses for asthma phenotype, 5 common loci for atopy and 3 for all ergic asthma. Among them 1 principal locus (including 5 CpG sites or more) was identified in asthma (17q21.2) and 2 principal loci in atopy (5q31.1 and 6p22.1). The three loci identified have already been associated with asthma in previous studies. Analyses are in progress in order to compare common genes associated in both Ã¢ÂÂomicsÃ¢ÂÂ methods.

We measured leucocyteÃ¢ÂÂs DNA methylation levels at IL1R1 and IL1R2 gene loci for 93 individuals using bis pyrosequencing. mRNA levels were quantified using qRT PCR in a subsample of 37 individuals. Individuals with asthma had higher DNA methylation levels at both IL1R1 and IL1R2 gene loci in comparison to controls (without history of asthma and/or atopy) (15.9ÃÂ±4.1 vs 13.0ÃÂ±2.9, p,0.02 and 48.6ÃÂ±13.1 vs 40.8ÃÂ±10.8, p,0.04 respec tively).

Previously reported genotype phenotype correlations with paternal unipa rental disomy, IC1, and IC2 epimutation groups were confirmed and poten tial novel associations detected. Predictive values of previously described clinical diagnostic criteria were compared, and although there were diffe rences in sensitivity and specificity, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis demonstrated that these were not optimal in predicting 11p15.5 methylation abnormalities. Using logistic regression, we identified clinical features with the best predictive value for a positive methylation abnorma lity. We developed a weighted scoring system (sensitivity 75.9% and speci ficity 81.8%) to prioritise patients presenting with the most common fea tures of BWS, and ROC analysis demonstrated superior performance (area under the curve 0.85; 95% CI: 0.83 0.87) compared to previous criteria. We suggest that this novel tool will facilitate selection of patients with suspected BWS for routine diagnostic testing and so improve the diagnosis of the disorder.",2014

Loss of imprinting (LOI) through methylation loss (LOM) or gain (GOM) may result in imprinting disorders (IDs). Beckwith Wiedemann syndrome is a paradigmatic ID, which arises from dysregulated expression of imprinted growth regulatory genes at 11p15.5. We pursued a genome wide methyla tion study to investigate our cohort of IC2 hypomethylated BWS patients for the occurrence of Multilocus Methylation Defects (MMD) at imprinted loci. To this purpose we selected from a cohort of 171 patients with clinical presentation in the spectrum of Beckwith Wiedemann syndrome carrying an 11p15.5 epimutation, 18 cases hypomethylated at IC2: 14 with a com plete phenotype, 2 with isolated hemihyperplasia (IH) and two couples of monozygous twins with discordant phenotype, but concordant for the IC2 defect in blood tissue. The Processing of genomic DNAs from peripheral blood on an Infinium Human Methylation 450K BeadChip Kit Array (Illu mina)showed that 7/16 (44%) of IC2 epimutated BWS and 2/2 IH patients ABSTRACTS POSTERS ESHG 2014 | MILAN, ITALY | WWW.

These comprised hypermethylation at GNAS DMRs and hypomethylation at GNAS, PLAGL1, DIRAS3, FAM50B and ZNF331 loci, confirming the view of a network of imprinting deregulated genes. MMD were detected in blood and saliva from both affected twin members, but complementary pyrosequencing and MS MLPA analyses showed that me thylation defects were absent/attenuated in the DNA from saliva in the unaf fected co twins. This findings will enhance clinical practice and epigenotype phenotype correlations.

22029,"The investigation of human imprinting disorders has provided important insights into the role of genomic imprinting in normal health and develop ment. Beckwith Wiedemann syndrome (BWS) is a congenital overgrowth disorder associated with abnormal function of 11p15.5 imprinted genes. The most common cause of BWS is loss of methylation (epimutation) at the imprinting centre 2 (IC2/KvDMR1). We and others have found that a sub group of BWS patients also harbour epimutations at other imprinting cen tres (ICs) outside of 11p15.5. This multiple epimutation (ME+) phenotype has been associated with assisted reproductive technologies births though the clinical significance of these additional epimutations has not been clear ly defined. Another human imprinting disorder, Silver Russell syndrome (SRS) is also linked to the 11p15.5 imprinted gene cluster but, in contrast to BWS, is characterized by pre and postnatal growth retardation and, most commonly, epimutations (loss of paternal allele methylation) at IC1. In or der to comprehensively define potential ME+ epigenotypes in BWS and SRS patients we undertook methylation profiling in 67 and 22 patients respec tively with the Illumina 450k methylation BeadChip. Analysis of methylati on status at 37 imprinted differentially methylated regions (DMRs) (31 well characterized known DMRs (kDMRs) and 6 recently reported novel DMRs (nDMRs) (PMID:24402520)). The most frequently affected non 11p15.5 kDMRs in ME+ BWS patients were on chromosome 1, 6 and 15. In addition, epimutations at nDMRs located on chromosome 8 and 22 were frequent. Further analysis of the ME+ epigenotype patterns and clinical correlates in BWS and SRS patients will be presented in detail.",2014
22030,"The field of human genetics is being revolutionized by exome and genome sequencing. A massive amount of data is being produced at ever increasing rates. Targeted exome sequencing can be completed in a few days using NGS, allowing for new variant discovery in a matter of weeks. The technology ge nerates considerable numbers of false positives, and the differentiation of sequencing errors from true mutations is not a straightforward task. Mo reover, the identification of changes of interest from amongst tens of thou sands of variants requires annotation drawn from various sources, as well as advanced filtering capabilities. We have developed Highlander, a Java software coupled to a MySQL database, in order to centralize all variant data and annotations from the lab, and to provide powerful filtering tools that are easily accessible to the biologist. Data can be generated by any NGS ma chine (such as Life TechnologiesÃ¢ÂÂ Solid or Ion Torrent, or IlluminaÃ¢ÂÂs HiSeq) and most variant callers (such as Life TechnologiesÃ¢ÂÂ LifeScope or Broad InstituteÃ¢ÂÂs GATK).

22031,"The ability to detect low level genetic variants in heterogeneous populati ons of cells is necessary for identifying postzygotic or somatic mutations underlying human diseases such as mosaic birth defects involving the skin. Existing bioinformatics methods for detecting such variations have been mainly developed for cancer genomics and are usually based on the analysis of paired samples. Furthermore, they have limited sensitivity in detecting certain types of variants such as insertions/deletions. SomatiCaller was de veloped to systematically detect low level variants in next generation DNA sequencing data. It consists in browsing aligned sequence data (BAM files) of pairs or trios (i.e. index case and parents) to systematically identify posi tions with candidate variants. Statistical tests are first performed between different samples to measure the sampleÃ¢ÂÂs independence of a candidate po sition for a given variation. In a second time, allelic ratios from all candida te sites are compared to a series of negative controls by StudentÃ¢ÂÂs t test to discriminate true positive variants from probable sequencing or alignment errors. Applied to targeted deep sequencing of a gene associated with mo saic overgrowth syndromes (PIK3CA), SomatiCaller led to identification of variants with allelic fractions as low as 0.01. Experiments from trio based exome sequencing data demonstrated its ability to readily detect variants with allelic fractions as low as 0.05. Compared to standard variant callers, SomatiCaller showed increased sensitivity for genetic variants present in less than 10% of reads. Potential applications of this tool are numerous in the growing field of the genetics of mosaic diseases, both for research and molecular diagnosis purposes.",2014

22035,"Cardiomyopathies are genetically heterogeneous group of diseases of the myocardium. Mutations in multiple genes have been associated with car diomyopathy and many cases of cardiomyopathy have a genetic component. Genetic factors may be responsible for 30 50% of cases of dilated cardio myopathy (DCM), and about 90% of cases of Hypertrophic cardiomyopa thy (HCM) are familial. As clinical genetic testing is rapidly emerging with a principal rationale of identifying at risk asymptomatic relatives, knowledge of predisposing loci can guide clinical surveillance for disease onset, thereby enhancing preventive and treatment interventions. We collected over 6000 genetic variants from over 80 genes with known associations with cardiomyopathies, and queried the 1000 Genomes Project database for exonic variants in the genes. We analyzed and compared the rate of missense variation in the two datasets using a window bin of 50bp. Though most variants are rare (78.7%), and 58.4% (2751/4708) being pri vate, 25.7% (655/2544) of missense variants from 1000 Genomes Project database are predicted to be pathogenic. Of the overlapping variants, 20.4% (42/206) and 42.2% (87/206) are known and predicted pathogenic variati ons respectively. We identified 104 regions distributed among 15 genes, in cluding LMNA, MYH7, TNNT2, and MYBPC3, with high density of pathogenic variants and no or extremely low variant in the population data. Majority of the identified loci overlap protein domains that play critical roles.

22036,"Genomic instability is a well known hallmark of cancer. Recent genome se quencing studies have identified a novel phenomenon called chromothrip sis in which complex genomic rearrangements are thought to be derived from a single catastrophic event rather than by several incremental steps. While chromothripsis is well documented in solid tumors and leukemias, chromothripsis in lymphoma is rarely reported. We report a case of possible chromothripsis in a patient presenting with a thyroid mass suspicious for diffuse large B cell lymphoma. Chromosome analysis showed a complex ka ryotype with multiple rearrangements, including a translocation of chromo somes 3 and 7 involving the BCL6 gene region, chromosomes 14, 7 and 22 with involvement of the IGH gene region and an unbalanced structural rear rangement involving chromosomes 8 and 18 involving the BCL2 gene region..

However, array analysis did not reveal any imbalance involving the BCL6, BCL2 or IGH gene regions whose rearrangements were observed by FISH, thus suggesting that these rearrangements are balanced in nature.

Various methods have been proposed to detect CNVs from NGS data, but little information is available which compare the success of these approaches to orthogonal me thods. Using a large data set of constitutional samples from an autism cohort that have been subjected to both whole exome sequencing (WES) and to a genome wide SNP microarray, we compare the ability to detect CNVs bet ween these platforms.

We present a single molecule genome analysis system (Irys) based on Na noChannel Array technology that linearizes extremely long DNA molecules for direct observation. This high throughput platform automates the ima ging of single molecules of genomic DNA hundreds of kilobases in size to measure sufficient sequence uniqueness for unambiguous assembly of com plex genomes. High resolution genome maps assembled de novo preserve long range structural information necessary for structural variation detec tion and assembly applications. We have used Irys genome mapping for the assembly and characterization of several genomes, including human, plant, fungi, and bacteria. In addition to describing the technology and analysis approaches useful for dissecting complex genomes, we demonstrate results from several genomes, where genome maps span remaining reference gaps, identify known and no vel structural variants (including balanced rearrangements) and phase va riation within haplotype blocks.

22040,Detection of copy number variation (CNV) from NGS data is an important mechanism for understanding and identifying genetic factors in constitu tional diseases and cancer. Our evaluation of existing public algorithms re vealed that they did not reliably detect short length CNVs from NGS gene panel data. A new CNV detection algorithm is introduced in SureCallv2.0 software for target enriched NGS data generated from SureSelect and Halo plex. This algorithm is able to predict breakpoints using the low genomic co verage of small panels. This feature makes it different from other algorithms based on read depth that require adequate genomic coverage to normalize the data and model copy number of different regions. A diploid reference is used to compute log ratio values from the normalized read depths with respect to the sample that minimizes the need to make additional correc tions with respect to GC content and mappability. Reference and sample can either be run together or taken from different sequencing experiments. An internal read depth normalization step handles the difference in the number of sequencing reads between sample and reference. The resolution of de tection is that of a single interval where the interval boundaries are defined from the baits or amplicons that cover the regions of interest in the genes. Aberrant intervals are labeled as significant after applying an iterative me thod that optimizes the tradeoff between least squares fit of the data and the penalty caused by break points.

22041,"Introduction: Copy number variation (CNV) was more and more investiga ted in complex diseases. We analysed CNVs of Fc fragment of IgG, low affini ty IIIb, receptor (FCGR3B), a candidate gene in Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA). DropletÃÂ® Digital PCR was used to quantify CNVs and to identify tandem re peat. Patients and Methods: Thirty eight RA trio families (one patient with two parents) and seven control samples (with known copy number) were genotyped using DropletÃÂ® Digital PCR (ddPCR, BioRad), which performs an absolute quantification using up to 20,000 reactions for one sample. Dige stion reactions were done in the reaction mix for each sample with several concentrations of endonuclease FokI enzyme, in order to separate replica ted copies in tandem on the same chromosome. Results: CNVs quantification showed 1 (9.65%), 2 (83.33%) or 3 (7.02%) copies. Comparison of results from undigested and digested DNAs (2U of enzyme with 33ng of DNA) sho wed a difference in copy number (CN) estimation for samples with tandem copies. The CN value obtained without digestion was under estimated in comparison with digestion. However, when one copy of the gene was located on each chromosome, the CN estimation was not different between the two protocols. Conclusion: Use of ddPCR with digested and undigested DNAs al lowed CNVs quantification for FCGR3B. We also highlighted recombination mechanisms (tandem copies) leading to a better genotype characterization. Further investigation of FCGR3B CNVs and their transmission in 200 trio fa milies will be performed, to better understand the impact of these candidate gene variations in RA.

DNA methylation modifications may occur in response to a wide variety of exposures, including diet and metabolic status. In the context of the EPICOR study aimed at identifying relationships between DNA methylation status and myocardial infarction risk (292 cases, 292 controls from the EPIC Italy cohort), we evaluated the association of lipidic profiles to genome wide DNA methylation in a sample of 277 subjects (153 cases, 124 controls) not treated for diabetes nor under cholesterol/blood pressure lowering treat ments. DNA methylation was assessed with the Illumina HumanMethylati on450 BeadChip, and data analysed according to standard procedures (Me thyLumi, Bioconductor), correcting for gender, BMI, season and centre of re cruitment, estimated white blood cells percentage, chip position and batch. At a linear regression analysis, we found an interesting association between a CpG site in the promoter region of the 24 dehydrocholesterol reductase gene (DHCR24 ) and serum HDL levels (effect size 1.2*10 3, p,3.93*10 5).

Pain is the most unpleasant symptom of illness, which is mediated by a va riety agents released from local inflammatory cells. Recent studies points to the involvement of epigenetic mechanisms both in the development and maintenance of pain states. One of the most fundamental epigenetic marks is the methylation of cytosine residues in DNA, catalyzed by DNA methyltransferase enzymes. The aim of the present study was to analyze the changes of DNMT1, DNMT3a and DNMT3b in the trigeminal ganglia (TG) neurons during the maintenance phase of pain states and their modulation by NSAID. The Mustard oil ( 10%) was applied to four month age rats to induce acu te inflammatory pain and responses to mechanical and heat stimuli were assessed. All animal studies conformed to the Guidelines of International Association for the study of Pain regarding investigations. The levels of DN MT1, DNMT3a and DNMT3b were measured in nuclear extracts of Trigemi nal ganglia (TGs) neurons in study and control groups. DNMTs assay kits were used to measure the amount of DNA methyltransferases. We found that the Mustard oil evoked pain increased the levels of DNMT3a and DNMT3b, while it has no significant effect on levels of DNMT1 in the same regions compare to control sample. Previous administration of the NSAID revials reduced levels of DNMT3a and DNMT3b. This study provides the evidence that DNA methylation plays a role in de velopment of pain in animal models.

22045,"Duchenne muscular dystrophy female carriers are clinically asymptomatic. Nevertheless a small group, defined as manifesting carriers, can develop symptoms, varying from a mild muscle weakness to a DMD like phenotype.

Lack of relationship between X inactivation, transcription balancing and asympto matic/symptomatic phenotype was recently observed. To date, the mole cular mechanism underlying the clinical heterogeneity in female carriers is unknown. In this study, the combined approach of high troughput technologies and novel statistical analysis methods has allowed us to identify a group of SNPs which could discriminate the symptomatic/asymptomatic phenotypes. We performed Whole Exome Sequencing and RNA seq analysis (Illumina GAIIe, Agilent Sure Select enrichment) on a symptomatic DMD carrier.

These selected SNPs have been investigated in two cohorts of carriers: 18 symptomatic (muscle weakness) and 16 asymptomatic (family history of dystrophinopathy or mild myopathic signs, but absence of muscle wea kness).Novel statistical approaches on selected SNPs based on multidimensional scaling and membership probability, allowed us to identify three SNPs in 3Ã¢ÂÂUTR region which could discriminate the symptomatic/asymptomatic phenotypes.

New evidences highlight the relevance of microenviron ment on the epigenetics and the need to use culture models that preserve the tissue morphology, to better understand the mode of action of CRAs. We studied the epigenetic response induced by culture condition and CRAs treatment, in a preclinical model based on organotypic culture from normal and neoplastic lung specimens, that preserves ex vivo the original tissue microenvironment and morphology. We assessed the expression pattern of histone deacetylases (HDACs) and methylation profile of Ã¢ÂÂlong interspersed nuclear elementsÃ¢ÂÂ LINE1s and a panel of tumor suppressor genes. We obser ved a different behavior of the organotypic culture respect to that reported for other ex vivo models. Interestingly, culture induced an overall increase of LINE1s methylation, whereas CRAs caused LINE1s demethylation. Diffe rently, culture and CRAs induced opposite effects on the genes: the samples responded specifically, showing demethylation for some promoters and in creased methylation for others. Moreover, we noted that the culture caused alterations in the HDACs expression pattern. These overall data reveal the importance of the maintaining the cells in their original organ architecture to study the mode of action of the CRAs, and sug gest that CRAs do not work only in a non specific way, as previously thought, in particular on the gene promoters.",2014

Introduction Epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC), is generally sensitive to first line platinum based therapy, however more than 80% of patients experi ence relapse within 18 months and become resistant to subsequent lines, until the disease becomes incurable.

Transcrptional profiling, performed in a cohort of patients from which mat ched biopsies were taken at primary surgery (PS O) when tumor was naÃÂ¯ve to chemotherapy and at time of relapse (SCR) when the tumor was resistant, identified the EMT pathway as a key player in relapse (Marchini et al., 2013). Here we describe the development of computational approaches to identify somatic variants using targeted DNA resequencing with an Illumina MiSeq on our cohort of SCR and PS O samples. Methods We improved an existing community developed bioinformatics pipeline: bcbio nextgen.

22048,"The human exome seems to represent a dynamic system in terms of interin dividual variability. However, due to the lack of widely accepted criteria for determining copy number variation (CNV) pathogenic value, the creation of a map depicting the wide spectrum of benign CNV in the human exome is hindered. To make a step forward on the road to the map of human exome variations, we have evaluated 151 unrelated individuals using high resolu tion CNV analysis by Affymetrix 2.7M SNP array and an original bioinfor matics technology. CNV affecting exons of intellectual disability genes were associated with X linked mental retardation, X linked dominant conditions and autosomal dominant intellectual disability. Exome CNV affecting X lin ked mental retardation genes in males were as follows: duplication of one OPHN1 exon (3 individuals) and four DLG3 exons (3 individuals), duplicati on of twenty six L1CAM exons (7 individuals). Benign intragenic CNV affec ting X linked dominant genes in females were associated with duplication of twelve SMC1A exons (Cornelia de Lange syndrome 2) in 8 individuals and duplication of six PORCN exons (Focal dermal hypoplasia) in 3 individuals. Benign exome variations affecting genes associated with autosomal domi nant intellectual disability were associated with deletion of one SMARCA2 exon (3 individuals) and duplication of one TSC1 exon (12 individuals), KANSL1 duplication (18 individuals) and deletion of two NHEJ1 exons (5 in dividuals). Our data demonstrate that benign exome CNV affecting intellec tual disability genes are relatively common in humans representing a pitfall for molecular diagnosis of genomic and single gene disorders.

In these patients the disease causing variants are unknown: either known disease related genes have initially been found to be unaffected, or the cause of the disease is generally unclear. Depending on the expected mode of inheritance either patient/parent trios or only the patients are sequenced. From the total set of single nucleotide variants (SNVs) and small indels, we remove common polymorphisms and calling artifacts by comparison to the 1000 Genomes database and an in house control database. From the remai ning variants we identify a candidate set based on the assumed mode of inheritance, which are then prioritized based on the predicted functional effect of the variant and the tolerance of the gene to coding mutations. In ad dition, network analysis of the candidate genes together with a list of genes known to be associated with the particular disease is performed to identify the most promising candidate(s) which then undergo functional evaluati on. We found a rare homozygous mutation in the COQ6 gene in a nephrotic syn drome patient. A homozygous mutation in the same gene was reported ear lier to be associated with nephrotic syndrome and sensorineural deafness. Since the patient also suffers from severe hearing impairment, it is highly likely that the candidate variant is the cause of the symptoms.

In prin ciple, data analysis in this context is as simple as comparing a list of variants identified in a patient with a comprehensive list of disease causing variants. In practice, this is currently limited by the substantial number of DNA vari ants with false annotation or uncertain significance. We set up an IT environment that supports central sequencing and automa ted primary data analysis and subsequently provides the results via a web interface to researchers and geneticists for manual curation, annotation and experimental validation. As a pilot project, three cooperating diagnostic teams are investigating 250 trios consisting of patients with severe to mild ID and their healthy parents for which high coverage exome sequences have been generated. Variant data including Pindel and CNV calls are generated by an analysis pipeline and stored in a database. Preliminary analysis revealed 1.7 de novo non synonymous coding and canonical splice site mutations per patient. 20% of the investigated cases carried a mutation in genes already known to cause ID. In addition, evidence for novel ID candidate genes is being ge nerated from the detection of SNVs and indels in specific genes from known microdeletion regions.

22052,"Groupwise functional analysis of gene variants is becoming standard in next generation sequencing studies. As the function of many genes is unknown and their classification to pathways is scant, functional associations bet ween genes are often inferred from large scale omics data. Such data types including protein protein interactions and gene co expression networks are used to examine the interrelations of the implicated genes. Statistical significance is assessed by comparing the interconnectedness of the muta ted genes with that of random gene sets. However, interconnectedness can be affected by confounding bias, potentially resulting in false positive fin dings. We show that genes implicated through de novo sequence variants are biased in their coding sequence length and longer genes tend to cluster tog ether, which leads to exaggerated p values in functional studies; we present here a method that addresses these bias. To discern molecular pathways relevant to complex disease, we have inferred functional associations bet ween human genes from diverse data types and assessed them with a novel phenotype based method. Examining the functional association between de novo gene variants, we control for the heretofore unexplored confounding bias in coding sequence length. We test different data types and networks and find that the disease associated genes cluster more significantly in an integrated phenotypic linkage network than in other gene networks. We present a tool of superior power to identify functional associations among genes mutated in the same disease even after accounting for significant se quencing study bias and demonstrate the suitability of this method to func tionally subcluster gene variants underlying a complex disorder.",2014

Typi cal whole exome sequences depict ~25,000 non reference coding variants; only a few signify disease. As a rule, one relies on criteria such as rarity in the general population, predicted damage, and evolutionary conservation in the encoded protein and segregation in more than one affected individual, to shorten the potential gene list. We have constructed the VarElect tool for phenotype dependent variant prioritization, leveraging the rich informati on and scoring mechanisms of GeneCards and MalaCards, the human gene and disease compendiums, to enable the zooming in on a handful or even just one candidate gene. Its algorithm affords inferring direct as well as indi rect links between genes and phenotypes, matching the provided keywords best describing the disease and its symptoms. An example of an indirect Ge neCards based inference of GeneA to Phenotype PhenX is when the disease is found to be linked to GeneB, which in turn shares a pathway with GeneA. Such gene to gene relations are also formed (among others) by interaction networks, paralogy relations, domain sharing, and mutual publications. Ma laCards, in turn, allows one to produce a comprehensive phenotype search expression by utilizing this databaseÃ¢ÂÂs built in information about diseases, their relationships, and their underlying symptoms. Thus VarElect provides a robust algorithm for ranking genes within a short list, and pointing out their likelihood to be related to a disease, which will prove indispensable in future clinical applications.",2014

Imprinting is maintained by epigenetic mechanisms including parent of origin specific DNA methylation, and its disruption leads to imprinting disorders affecting growth, metabolism and predisposition to cancer. Eight Ã¢ÂÂclassicalÃ¢ÂÂ imprinting disorders are known, linked to (epi)mutations of spe cific loci. However, some individuals have methylation anomalies affecting multiple imprinted loci (HIL) throughout the genome. Here we used epi genomewide analysis to investigate aberrant DNA methylation in HIL pa tients. We used the Illumina Infinium Human Methylation450 BeadChip array to assay genomic DNA methylation at ~475,000 sites in ten HIL patients with two clinical presentations (Beckwith Wiedemann syndrome and neonatal diabetes). We developed a novel informatic pipeline capable of small sample number analysis, and statistical criteria to quantify DNA methylation. The pipeline robustly detected hypomethylation at known imprinted loci, and 25 further candidate imprinted regions (nine shared between patient groups) including one in the Down syndrome critical region (WRB) and ano ther previously associated with bipolar disorder (PPIEL). Targeted analysis of three candidate regions (NHP2L1, WRB and PPIEL) confirmed allelic ex pression, methylation patterns consistent with allelic maternal methylation, and frequent hypomethylation among HIL patients.

22056,"Buzzati Traverso, Naples, Italy. Gamete of origin dependent gene expression, namely genomic imprinting, is controlled by allele specific epigenetic modifications of Imprinting Con trol Regions (ICRs). Either hypo or hyper DNA methylation abnormali ties abolishing the epigenetic asymmetry at the ICRs result in altered gene expression and disease. DNA methylation changes are accompanied by changes in histone modifications and long range protein interactions. ICR epigenetic alterations result from either mutations acting in cis or lesions affecting factors acting in trans, but in many cases their cause is unknown. A large cluster of imprinted genes lies on a conserved region of chromosome 11p15.5 and is associated with the growth disorders Beckwith Wiedemann syndrome (BWS) and Silver Russell syndrome (SRS). By studying several mutations affecting the IGF2/H19 ICR, we recently observed that the pe netrance of the BWS phenotype correlated with the intensity of ICR hyper methylation and that this is dependent on the affinity of the mutant allele for CTCF. We also implicated CDKN1C imprinting defects in prenatal growth restriction by demonstrating a deletion of the CDKN1C ICR in a case of seve re familial intra uterine growth restriction (IUGR). Finally, we found that in mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) the ZFP57/KAP1 complex is required to maintain CpG methylation and histone H3K9 trimethylation by specifically interacting with a methylated target motif that is enriched at the ICRs. The role of novel cis acting elements and trans acting factors in the origin of the imprinting defects is being investigated further by high throughput analysis of ZFP57 binding in human and mouse cells cells and 11p15.5 and exome targeted resequencing of patient DNAs.",2014

Here, we present the web server PECAS (Prokaryotic and Eukaryotic Classical Analysis of Secretomes) that provides a well established prediction tool on secreted proteins starting from multiple data sources, allowing users to re tain most sensible raw data files. These goals are achieved through a well established pipeline on secreted proteins prediction by screening different features for each of the evaluated proteins: (i) location of the predicted N terminal signal peptide (SP), (ii) detection of the presence and location of SP cleavage sites in amino acid sequences, (iii) presence of a maximum of one transmembrane domain and (iv), glycosylphosphatidylinositol membrane anchoring.

Currently available methods developed for the analysis of uniformly spaced SNP array maps do not fit easily the sparse and non uniform distribution of the WES target design. To meet the need of an approach specifically tailored to WES data we develo ped H3M2, an original algorithm based on Heterogeneous Hidden Markov Model that incorporates inter marker distances to detect ROH from Whole Exome Sequencing (WES) data.

The aim of our study was to estimate intra host genomic variati on of HCV 1b in naÃÂ¯ve and Pegylated Interferon Ribavirin treated patients. Serum viral RNA from 11 patients was reverstranscribed and amplified to produce 7.5 kb long amplicons that were random fragmented. A sequencing library was generated by specific adaptor ligation and analyzed using Ro che 454 Titanium chemistry and GS FLX platform. Data were analyzed using software published by The Broad Institute. Reads from each patient were assembled into contigs (Vicuna), oriented and frameshift corrected (V Fat). Raw reads were corrected for pyrosequencing errors (RC454) and sequence variants were called using V Phaser 2.0 and analysed with V Profiler. The HCV 1b Con1 isolate was used as control sample. The sequencing run resul ted in over 1 million passed filter reads with an average length of 397 bases and 30.81 quality score. Sustained viral response was associated to lower number of non synonymous mutations within the initial viral population compared to non responders. Also, NS2 mutation frequency seems higher in non responding patients.

Reduced sample sizes available in rare diseases are often an obstacle for the detection of candidate genes or the study of their molecular basis. The limitations of the approaches based on isolated genes can be overcome using systems biology approaches. This study shows as a combination of pathway based analysis (PBA) and network analysis allowed to discover four new loci (RASGEF1A and IQGAP2, DLC1 CHRNA7) related to signalling and migration processes associated with the disease, which were then validated in a cohort of 106 independent trios. The further study of an international cohort of 162 HSCR trios allowed us to confirm the molecular bases of disease using PBA. We found a significant association of processes related to signalling and its regulation as well as formation of the enteric nervous system. Although the genes associated with HSCR varied in different populations, the functions and interaction of affected networks of proteins were always the same, which reflects the com plexity of the disease.

22063,"Several histone post translational modifications are preferentially located in the promoter region of genes and are associated to the promoter activity. It is debated whether the histone modifications regulate the gene expressi on i.e., the histone code hypothesis or if they are put there as a consequence of transcription. In an earlier study we observed that the histone 3 acetylation signal upstream of the transcriptional start site (TSS) was lower in unidirectional compared to bidirectional genes. Following this observation, we hypothe sized that the transcribed region is modified during transcription and that the observed upstream signal is caused by transcription in the opposite di rection from the TSS. Promoters directing transcription in both directions are frequent in the genome, which would explain the common occurrence of upstream signals. Here we identified bidirectional or unidirectional genes based on TSS identi fied from cap analysis of gene expression and database searches. We compa red histone modification signals between these two classes of genes across several cell types. We have found significant differences for well known histone modifications, e.g. H3K4me3, H3K9ac and H3K27ac for which the upstream signal is higher in the bidirectional genes. Furthermore, we have compared transcription factor bindings between bidirectional and unidi rectional genes and found examples of differences in their prevalence and position relative to the TSS.

This ana lysis allowed to understand in which way, after transplantation, hAECs and hAMCs transcripts have been affected. Functional analysis of the affected transcripts revealed that the main bio logical functions involved are: Cell Death and Survival, Cellular Growth and Proliferation, Inflammatory Response, Cellular Function and Maintenance, Skeletal and Muscular System Development and Function and Connective Tissue Development and Function.

22070,"Malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) is a rare and aggressive tumor strongly associated with asbestos exposure. Its onset is usually 30 40 years after the first exposure, and it is characterized by a poor prognosis with a median survival of 12 months. Alterations in DNA methylation have been reported in several cancers, and are becoming an established hallmark of tumor. MPM is frequently associated with genetic mutations but also epige netic changes leading to gene expression modifications. The identification of MPM specific epigenetic markers in peripheral blood might be a useful methodology for defining biomarkers for potential early detection and may define methylation changes due to asbestos exposure. We conducted an epigenome wide analysis (>450K CpG sites) on DNA from whole blood cells of 129 MPM cases and 127 controls to evaluate differences in methylation profiles. The sample population was randomly split into two sets: training and test set. In the training set 60 differentially methylated regions (DMRs) between cases and controls, adjusting for gender, age, asbestos exposure, and white blood cells percentage were found (FDR adjusted p< 0.01). Using a cluster algorithm we validated the DMRs prediction performance in the test set (AUC,0.7625). We found significant enrichment for genes involved in leukocyte trans endothelial migration, natural killer cell mediated cytoto xicity and cell adhesion molecules pathways. Moreover we identified sever al genes belonging to the inflammation pathways and related to the cancer progression. Our results suggested that methylation status in whole blood DNA might provide a useful biomarker for potential MPM early detection.",2014

To provide new insights for novel targets discovery, we performed an extensi ve characterization by next generation sequencing (NGS) of a collection of melanoma cell lines derived from metastatic cases. Samples were profiled by whole exome sequencing (WES) and RNA sequencing using Illumina technology. Starting from WES data, we developed a bioinformatics pipe line to catalogue 2,172 novel mutations affecting genes in melanoma key pathways targeted by current therapies (MAPK and glutamate pathways) as well as genes never described for melanoma [Cifola, 2013]. Moreover, WES data were used to perform copy number alteration (CNA) analysis using a novel software developed by us, called Excavator, which is very sensitive and precise in DNA copies estimation even in situations of great sample hetero geneity [Magi, 2013]. CNA results were concordant with 250K SNP Array data and used to explore CN state of mutated genes. To collect and share the se results, we created a Melanoma Exome Database (https://155.253.6.64/ MExDB/). On the same samples, we also carried out RNA sequencing and performed both a traditional gene expression analysis and more sophisti cated structural evaluations. Focusing on fusion transcripts, we identified 72 putative events generated by either inter chromosomal translocations or intra chromosomal rearrangements, recently defined Ã¢ÂÂconjoined genesÃ¢ÂÂ and representing an additional gene regulation mechanism. Globally, NGS proved to be extremely powerful to dissect cancer complexity at both ge nomic and transcriptomic levels, and to identify novel potential targets for personalized treatment of cutaneous melanoma.",2014
22072,"Next generation sequencing has greatly accelerated the search for disease causing defects, but even for experts the implementation of data analysis can be a major challenge. To facilitate the data processing in a clinical setting, we have developed a novel Medical Re sequencing Analysis Pipeline (MERAP). MERAP assesses the quality of sequencing, and has optimized capacity for calling variants, including Single Nucleotide Variant, insertion and deleti on, Copy Number Variation, and other structural variants. MERAP identifies polymorphic and known causal variants by filtering against public domain databases, and flags non synonymous and splice site changes. MERAP uses a logistic model to estimate the causal likelihood of a given missense va riant. MERAP considers the relevant information such as phenotype and interaction with known disease causing genes. MERAP compares favorably with GATK, one of the widely used tools, because of its higher sensitivity for detecting indels, its easy installation, and its economical use of computatio nal resources. Upon testing more than 1,500 individuals with mutations in known and novel disease genes, MERAP proved highly reliable, as illustrated here for 5 families with disease causing variants, including a novel ANKS1A mutation identified in a patient with autosomal recessive non syndromic intellectual disability. We believe that the clinical implementation of MERAP will expedite the diagnostic process of many disease causing defects.",2014

Aging is associated with an increased risk for many complex diseases. DNA methylation represents one of the most promising biomarkers of aging. To evaluate the effect of age on DNA methylation, we examined the methylation levels of more than 450K CpG sites in 206 cases and 206 matched controls belonging to the Italian section of the EPIC cohort. EPIC healthy volunteers were recruited between 1994 98 and followed up for myocardial infarction and other diseases. For the CpG methylation level assessment on blood DNA we used the Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip. Data were analyzed according to standard procedures (MethyLumi, Bioconductor). All analyses were corrected for sex, BMI, season, center of recruitment, cellular subtypes ABSTRACTS POSTERS ESHG 2014 | MILAN, ITALY | WWW. ESHG. ORG 316Back to inde x and batch effect. Linear regression analysis showed that 10,000 CpG sites were significantly associated with age after Bonferroni correction (p<10 7). Positive correlation with age was found for 5,687 CpG sites (57%), whereas 4,313 CpG sites (43%) were negatively correlated with age. The top four significant loci (p<10 28) were located in the CpG islands of ELOVL2 and FHL2 genes. Methylation levels of the 4 CpG sites were positively correlated with increasing age, according to previously published results. These re sults confirm that DNA methylation alterations occur during aging and that ELOVL2 and FHL2 genes could be used as biomarker of aging. Moreover, the methylation differences associated with age could help in understan ding molecular mechanisms that underlie the development of age related diseases.",2014

An increased rate of maternal inheritance and excess number of affected females implicate involvement of epigenetic effects in the etiology of IGE syndromes. In this study, we have performed a whole genome methylation analysis for 15 parent offspring trios with vertical inheritance of the IGE trait. DNA samples were subjected to bisulphite conversion prior to IlluminaHuman Methylation 450K Beadarray application. Beadchips were scanned through Illumina iScan platform.

As an alternative approach, we have run a pathway based analysis to see if genes with differential methylation values map to common pathways. This analysis with PANOGA software revealed various pathways particularly with synaptic and immunological functions.

Marfan syndrome is an inherited multisystem disorder that affects the con nective tissue. The typical onset is in adulthood and often occurs in children with isolated clinical signs. The revised Ghent criteria allow to confirm the diagnosis if ectopia lentis is in concomitance with a mutation in the FBN1 gene definitely associated with Marfan syndrome. Our patient (5 years old) presents a mutation (p. C154Y) never reported in the literature, hence the difficulty in establishing a diagnosis. We perform molecular dynamic simu lation to investigate how this mutation affects the protein stability. Analysis was carried out on the mutated form of the N terminal domain of the hu man fibrillin 1 (pdb code 2M74) . Structural analyses indicates that mutati on perturb the secondary structure of the protein, which reduce the folding stability of the system. The C154Y mutation disrupts the C154 C166 disul fide bridge and consequently the two antiparallel beta sheets are impaired. In conclusion, the mutation leads to a destabilization of the native folding of the protein, and therefore a probably reduction of the physiological acti vity. The patient is monitored in follow up because it has all probability of developing the Marfan syndrome. This study emphasizes the utility to cha racterize a mutation through molecular modeling in all late onset diseases in order to correct follow up of patients.",2014
22076,"LHX1 is a putative transcription factor widely distributed among vertebra tes. In mice, Lhx1 acts as a high hierarchy regulator during urogenital deve lopment, as female Lhx1 null mutants lack MÃÂ¼llerian derivatives. Deletions and point mutations affecting LHX1 have been found in female patients with MÃÂ¼llerian aplasia (MA). However, the low recurrence of these alterations indicates that this disorder is multifactorial, and few reports using high resolution genome mapping techniques have been published. Hence, the identification of candidate genes for MA demands deeper analysis. In or der to identify candidate genes for MA, we used a bioinformatic approach to predict LHX1 target genes, and the results were contrasted against the set of genes with copy number alterations compiled from the microarray reports on MA patients. Starting from 4 documented Lhx1 regulation targets in Xenopus and their homologs in 5 other species, a highly conserved 50 nt signature was identified (e value 1.34e 36). Several known transcription fac tor binding sites were contained in such signature, including those of HO XA5 and HNFB1 , which have been previously associated to MA. The refined motif was further searched against the human genome promoter regions, and 45 putative target genes of LHX1 were identified. Of these, 38 genes are expressed in uterine tissues, 19 during embryogenesis, and 15 in both con ditions. Two genes, NPHP1 and PIAS3, were found deleted in MA patients. In conclusion, our approach will be useful to prioritize genes relevant to MÃÂ¼lle rian development and may help to establish future validation protocols.",2014

22079,"Our research aims to identify recessive mutations in the endogamous Irish Traveller population using exome sequencing. Through our studies, we have identified issues that may complicate identification of disease mutations in consanguineous populations: (a) increased number of candidate variants due to higher than expected levels of genome homozygosity, (b) the effect of cryptic relatedness on the use of population matched controls and (c) increased phenotypic variability due to increased likelihood of multiple dis orders in the same individual. Homozygosity levels in patients from traditionally endogamous populations are often much higher than the predicted levels from first cousin marriages in non endogamous populations. This results in a large number of novel/rare homozygous variants per patient exome. Population matched controls are very useful in this situation to distinguish benign from pathogenic va riants. However, due to Traveller culture, key pedigree information is often not forthcoming. Therefore, there is an increased risk of cryptic relatedness between the patients and the controls, which can lead to the erroneous filte ring out of pathogenic variants. Inter and intra familial variability in patients with the same disease muta tion may be due to variable expressivity. However, in families from endoga mous populations there is the increased possibility of patients having more than one recessive disorder, thus distorting the phenotype. When faced with phenotypic variability, we found it useful to analyse each patientÃ¢ÂÂs pheno type and exome individually and have identified patients with up to three different recessive disorders using this approach.

No tably DNA sequencing benefited from this change, becoming more popular and frequently used, specially in the domain of diagnostics. As became ap parent, the data from DNA sequencing does often not allow for conclusive diagnostics, as it only shows one aspect of what contributes to the patients phenotype. The combination of OMICs data like genomics, transcriptomics and proteomics presents itself as a solution to this problem, especially in the context of family analysis which helps to identify interesting features. While many methods have been developed combining different OMICs sources to create more complete and comprehensive analyses of a patients genotype, doing family analysis in the context of OMICs data with an user friendly vi sualization of the data is still explored very little. We present our vision of a comprehensive, user friendly application which concentrates on several key features of OMICs data for comparative analysis. Our vision concentrates on family analysis of three key features.

22082,"DNA methylation in gametes, particularly in oocytes, marks a subset of genes for appropriate expression in the next generation, as in the case of imprin ted genes. Imprinting errors have been associated with assisted reproduc tion technologies (ART): because ART may involve manipulation of oocytes when methylation may be most vulnerable, it is important to understand the mechanisms of methylation establishment. In oocytes, methylated CpG islands (CGIs) often localise within transcription units, as in the case of the differentially methylated regions of imprinted genes; moreover, methylation has been described as being predominantly over gene bodies. These obser vations suggest that methylation is governed by the activity of promoters induced during oocyte development. To investigate the fraction of the methylome linked to transcription, we in tegrated genome wide methylation maps with deep RNA seq from different stages of oocyte development. This revealed that most hypermethylated domains precisely match active transcription units; this is true especially where transcription units do not match standard genome annotation becau se of the existence of unannotated upstream transcription start sites (TSS) ABSTRACTS POSTERS ESHG 2014 | MILAN, ITALY | WWW.

One potential noninvasive biomar ker in urine is GSTP1 DNA methylation. Materials and Methods: Using HRM technology we have analyzed GSTP1 promoter hypermethylation in urine samples of 64 PC patients, 26 controls with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and 20 young asymptomatic men (YAM). Our goal was to determine the diagnostic accuracy and correlations of this biomarker with clinicopathological characteristics in Bulgarian PC patients. Results: Methylation was found in 70.31% of the patients, in 65.38% of the BPH controls and 15% of the YAM. Our results demonstrated that there was not significant difference of GSTP1 methylation among patients and BPH controls but among patients and YAM (p,0.000016). The ability of the biomarker to distinguish patients from BPH controls was evaluated. Serum PSA levels outperformed GSTP1 with estimated AUCs in ROC curve analy sis 0.745 and 0.525 respectively. Methylation of GSTP1 correlates with age (PearsonÃ¢ÂÂs correlation coefficient 0.225, p ,0.018) but not with Gleason score, tumor stage and PSA. Conclusions: In our study the GSTP1 promoter hypermethylation in urine did not prove to be sensitive and specific diagnostic biomarker for PC and probably it is associated with age. Further investigations are needed to con firm these observations.

22088,"Structural variants (SVs) impact tissue transcriptome by modifying the level and timing of expression of genes that localize within and on their flanks. We used mouse inbred strains to extensively gauge the influence of struc tural variants on the transcriptome complexity and regulation. We genera ted extensive RNA seq data from mice liver and brain and intersected them with the Mouse Genomes project catalog of SVs encompassing insertions, inversions, deletions and copy number gains to assess simultaneously the impact of genome structural changes on both gene expression and alterna tive splicing. While large SVs directly impact transcript expression levels, smaller SVs si gnificantly influence splicing diversity in several manners. When lying in an exon, SVs significantly favor the emergence of alternative splicing through usage of multiple donor sites regardless of the maintenance or disruption of the open reading frame. Conversely, a deletion or insertion within an intron significantly increases the number of alternative splice acceptor sites of the surrounding exons. Finally, exons that lie just upstream or downstream of a SV containing intron are significantly more often skipped out by splicing. These impacts are independent from the SV size suggesting that it is a pro perty of the rearrangement per se rather than the consequence of a change of size of the intron or exon. Interestingly, when several SVs are embedded within an exon or intron they appear to have a cumulative effect on splicing events. We show that SVs do impact tissue transcriptome on a global scale by alte ring its complexity and diversity through alternative splicing.",2014

To address these challenges, we first applied a high throughput, cost effective genome mapping technology using long single molecule (>150kb) to discover genome wide SVs and structure differences in the YH genome. We detected 278 large SVs (>10 kb), of which 251 of 278 (90%) are retro spectively supported by multiple orthogonal methods such as whole geno me or fosmid end sequencing (200/278) and historical evidence contained in the DGV database (51/78).

All approaches currently available for this purpose calculate a p value that aims to quantify the significance of the involvement of each pathway in the given phenotype. These p values were previously thought to be in dependent. Here we show that this is not the case, and that many pathways can considerably affect each otherÃ¢ÂÂs p values through a ``crosstalkÃ¢ÂÂÃ¢ÂÂ pheno menon. Although it is intuitive that various pathways could influence each other, the presence and extent of this phenomenon have not been rigorously studied and, most importantly, there is no currently available technique able to quantify the amount of such crosstalk. Here, we show that all three ma jor categories of pathway analysis methods (enrichment analysis, functional class scoring, and topology based methods) are severely influenced by cros stalk phenomena. Using real pathways and data, we show that in some cases pathways with significant p values are not biologically meaningful, and that some biologically meaningful pathways with non significant p values beco me statistically significant when the crosstalk effects of other pathways are removed. We describe a technique able to detect, quantify, and correct crosstalk ef fects, as well as identify independent functional modules.

Among these sub jects, a total of 3,271,336 variants were identified and an average of 269,865 variants was detected in each individual. Of which 14 variants were iden tified to be shared by all affected individuals but not by three unaffected fathers after filtering procedures. The variants we identified were mapped to four gene s (FRAS1, ABLIM3, FOXD4L5, and BAGE2) and three intergenic regions (1p22.2, 4q13.3, and Xq11.1). Eight variants clustered in ABLIM3 were compatible with autosomal recessive inheritance. One novel single nucleotide polymorphism in FOXD4L5 gene was detected and was compa tible with autosomal dominant inheritance. Our results reveal several novel gene variants for migraine and further studies are required to confirm this finding. ABSTRACTS POSTERS ESHG 2014 | MILAN, ITALY | WWW. ESHG.

22093,"Wilms Tumour is the most prevalent type of pediatric kidney cancer. Most occurrences are sporadic, however approximately 5% of cases are heredita ry; one such familial case has been identified in Atlantic Canada. None of the mutations that are currently known to cause Wilms Tumour are present in this family. Although our research to date has yielded no obvious causative mutation, whole genome sequencing and RNAseq expression data have led to a long list of genes that could potentially be involved. The need to priori tize this list, coupled with the clinical observation that age of onset differed depending on whether the disease was inherited maternally or paternally, have led us to consider epigenetic modifications. We have started by con sidering DNA methylation. Methylation occurs on cytosine residues of CpG islands, and can cause gene inactivation by hindering access of transcriptio nal machinery to the promoter regions of genes. Therefore, gene transcrip tion can be inhibited through hyper methylation or gene expression may be promoted by hypo methylation. We have assessed the methylation status of three genes (HDAC5, IGF2BP1, and POU6F2) in two patient and three control kidney samples using a methylation digest assay followed by qPCR. POU6F2 methylation was significantly decreased in both patient samples, which correlates with the increased expression we observed through RNA seq. However, the percent methylation varied between digest replicates, so we are currently attempting to confirm the results using bisulphite conversi on. Next, we will assess the methylation status of other candidate genes and will also investigate another epigenetic mechanism, histone acetylation.",2014
22094,"Historical and genetic studies have suggested that Roma people migrated from India about 1500 years ago and settled in Europe. We investigated the genetic connection of Central European Romas to populations they could be connected or admixed with during their migration through the Caucasus. Population samples were from Abhkasians, Armenians, Chechens, Kumyks, Kurds, Nogais, North Ossetians and Tadjiks living in the Caucasus area. We used publicly available Caucasus datasets and our Roma samples genotyped on Affymetrix Genome wide Human SNP Array 6.0 chip. We also used Stan ford HGDP , HapMap Phase 3 and Indian datasets in order to get a better per spective about population relationships. Applying linkage disequilibrium based pruning method, our datasets contained 88781 SNPs, respectively. Using advanced algorithms which are capable of processing large autosomal SNP datasets, we investigated genetic connection of these populations. In order to infer the structure and relationship of populations, principal com ponent analysis (PCA) and ADMIXTURE analysis were applied. PCA results show that Romas, compared to Central European and Indian populations, have more common genetic elements with the 8 investigated populations of the Caucasus area. Roma samples were most closely to Tadjiks and No gais, while the others clustered farther from Romas, approximately in the same distance. ADMIXTURE analysis supports PCA results and shows that the eight populations from Caucasus contain also more Indian ancestry than Central Europeans. The data may also suggest that despite the short interval of contact they still admixed or populations of the Caucasus also have the same strong Ancestral North Eurasian origin as Romas.

22095,"Objective:. There is growing evidence of a premature biological aging in many autoimmune diseases. So far, the different genetics factors involved on premature aging have not been established. The decline of thymus function is a measurement of biological aging and can be determined by measuring sjTRECs concentration (signal joint excision circles produced during T cell development). Our aim was to investigate the potential contribution of the major HLA II alleles associated with autoimmunity on the premature biolo gical aging. Methods:. A total of 670 healthy individuals were included in the current study. The sjTRECs concentration was determined by qPCR in duplo per individual using sjTRECs primers and probe as well as albumin as a reference gene (dCTvalue albumin dCT value sjTRECs). The different HLA alleles were determined by imputation based on Immunochip data using a Type 1 Diabetes Genetics Consortium (T1DGC, 5,225 individuals) as a refe rence panel. Results:. We found a statistically significant lower sjTRECs con centration in male compared with females (p,2.04*10 9). In addition, we found a lower sjTRECs concentration in males carrying HLA DQA1*01:02/ DQB1*06 haplotype, compared with HLA DQA1*01:02/DQB1*06 negative male individuals (p,0.01) regardless of the carried HLA DRB1 allele (either HLA DRB1*15:01 or HLA DRB1*13:02 ), although the difference does not remain significant after corrections for multiple testing.

Asthma is a chronic inflammatory disease of the airways, associated with genetic and environmental factors. Despite the heritability of asthma rela ted traits, suggesting an important genetic contribution in disease suscep tibility, a number of genome wide association studies (GWAS) have only revealed a handful of firm susceptibility genes to explain the architecture of this disease. In order to reveal new loci, here we leverage the distincti ve genetic features of the Spanish population, which harbors 4 20% North African admixture on average, and the information provided by the 1000 Genomes Project (1KGP), by performing a two stage GWAS with unrelated subjects. We have analyzed over 6.5 million common variants of the geno me (MAF>5%, Rsq>0.3) in 380 physician diagnosed asthmatics, from the Genetics of Asthma (GOA) study, and 552 population based controls, using the Axiom Genome Wide CEU1 array and imputation in 1KGP . Our findings provide evidence for enrichment of genes from the cytokine receptor inter action (FDR,0.006) and the WNT signaling (FDR,0.04) canonical pathways. We have prioritized 21 loci associated at pÃ¢ÂÂ¤5.0E 05 significance, some of them nearby firm susceptibility genes (e.g. IL1RL1 IL18R1 , HLA, and IL33 PTPRD ), while the remaining 76% have not been previously associated with asthma traits in previous GWAS.

The aim of this study was to understand the effects of the BDNF Val66Met functional genetic variant on several personality dimensions assessed using self reported instruments. We administered the Big Five Questionnaire (BFQ 2) and the Temperament and Character Inventory Revised (TCI R) for the measure of personality; the Emotional Intelligence Scale (EIS) and the Emotional Quotient Inventory (EQ I) for the measure of Emotional In telligence construct; a new instrument for the measure of Fluid Intelligen ce construct (CAT FIT).

In Thailand, birth defects contribute to 21% of neonatal deaths. In 2012, Queen Sirikit National Institute of Child Health has initiated a Birth Defects Registry to capture birth defects among newborn infants. Methods: The birth defects data come from 4 mainly sources: National Birth Registry Database; National Health Security OfficeÃ¢ÂÂs reimbursement database; Onli ne Birth Defect Registry Database designed to capture new cases detected later; and birth defects data from 20 participated hospitals. All data are linked by unique 13 digit national identification number and International Classification of Diseases (ICD) 10 codes. This registry includes 19 common structural birth defects conditions and pilots in 20 hospitals. The registry is hospital based, hybrid reporting system, including only live births whose in formation will be collected up to 1 year of age.

22103,"Background: Previously, relatively high cancer risks were observed in BR CA2 mutation carriers (BRCA2 carriers) over 60 in the Northern Nether lands. We aimed to quantify these regional differences in the breast cancer risk, and analyzed whether they could be explained by mutation spectrum or population background risk. Methods: This consecutive cohort study included all known BRCA1/2 carriers in the Northern Netherlands (N , 1,050). Carrier and general reference populations were: BRCA1/2 carriers in the rest of the Netherlands (N , 2,013) and the general population in both regions. Regional differences were assessed with hazard ratios (HR) and odds ratios (OR). HRs were adjusted for birth year and mutation spectrum. Results: All BRCA1 carriers and BRCA2 carriers under age 60 had a signi ficantly lower breast cancer risk in the Northern Netherlands, HR were 0.66 and 0.64, respectively. Above age 60, the breast cancer risk in BRCA2 carri ers in the Northern Netherlands was higher than in the rest of the Nether lands (HR , 3.99, 95%CI 1.11 14.35). Adjustment for mutational spectrum changed the HRs for BRCA1, BRCA2 <60 and BRCA2 ÃÂ³60 years by 3%, +32% and +11%, respectively. There was no difference in background breast can cer incidence between the two regions (OR , 1.03, 95%CI 0.97 1.09). Con clusions: Differences in mutation spectrum only partly explain the regional differences in breast cancer risk in BRCA2 carriers, and for an even smaller part in BRCA1 carriers.

In this study, we developed models combining the effects of genetic and non genetic risk factors to predict the risk of CKD in Korean populations. We conducted a GWAS using LMM and estimated the heritability of CKD using a set of 491,680 tag SNPs (r 2<0.8) selected from 4,721,497 SNPs being di rectly genotyped or imputed based on the 1000 Genomes data after adjust ment for age and gender in 943 patients with CKD and 950 healthy controls. The narrow sense heritability of CKD was 0.23 (P<0.05). We created genetic and non genetics risk scores and validated their predictability in two inde pendent studies.

The temporal coordination of biological processes into daily cycles is a com mon feature of most living organisms. Day/night cycles represent a major circadian synchronizing signal and vary widely with latitude. In humans dis ruption of circadian rhythms is a common feature in psychiatric diseases in cluding schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, depression and autism. We applied an approach that analyses spatial correlations between genetic variation and environmental factors. We exploited genotype data from 52 human po pulations distributed worldwide and determined the annual maximal varia tion in day length (ÃÂphotoperiod), this latter used as a measure of selective pressure. With this approach we analyzed 5 independent sets of genes invol ved in circadian regulation or in sleep homeostasis. For all sets a significant enrichment of variants showing signals of photoperiod driven selection was detected. Analysis of population genetic differentiation (FST) confir med strong spatial signatures of natural selection at photoperiod selected variants. Also, tests based on haplotype homozygosity indicated that a si gnificantly high proportion of photoperiod selected SNPs underwent selec tive sweeps in non African populations. Finally, using variants identified in genome wide association studies we determine that a significantly high proportion of risk SNPs for schizophrenia and/or bipolar disorder correla tes with ÃÂphotoperiod. Notably, many risk variants showing signals of pho toperiod driven selection map to genes with strong evidence of involvement in circadian rhythm regulation. Thus, human populations adapted to life at different latitudes by tuning their circadian clock systems. This process also involved risk variants for neuropsychiatric conditions.

The effect of combining data with different FÃ¢ÂÂs, was never examined, although taking a weighted average was already repor ted in literature. While testing the use of simulation as a method to examine the accuracy of estimating q, it was discovered by one of us that taking a mean value for F would always overestimate q.

Performing a con ditional analysis for the best signal (rs3806702, p value,1.03*10 159) no loci remain associated at genome wide significance, while many SNPs were associated at 5*10 8<p value<1*10 4, twenty of those were replicated in an independent sample. Genes closest to the replicated SNPs were included in a unique network involved in cellular development, death and survival. The replicated loci explain the 89.8% of the CRIPTO variance, with the 84.9% explained by the most associated SNP . Among the top associated SNPs, the rs112481213 variant (p value,1.53*10 158), located within the 5Ã¢ÂÂ²UTR of the CRIPTO gene, was predicted to create a binding site for AP 1 transcrip tion factor. To assess a functional role of this SNP , allele effect was tested on the transcriptional activity of luciferase in a cell system: the A allele was more efficient in driving transcription than the T allele, demonstrating that rs112481213 is a functional regulatory element of CRIPTO transcription. Further, EMSA experiments demonstrated that the A allele acts creating a AP 1 consensus binding site. Further investigation is warranted to detect association between the functional SNP and diseases susceptibility.",2014
22112,"Cystic Fibrosis (CF) is the most frequent severe inherited disease among Caucasians, having prevalence of 1:3000 and a carrier frequency of 1:27 in Italy. Three mutations in CFTR gene (F508del, N1303K, G542X) represent approximately 60% of mutated alleles, while a multitude of additional mu tations exhibit a low prevalence. In addition, the distribution of individual mutations varies throughout the country and several mutations are peculiar to specific regional areas, i.e, T338I is typical in Sardinia (15.1% of muta ted alleles), 2183AA >G and R1162X are frequent in Northeastern Italy (8% each). We now present data on CF genetic testing in Como, a 0.6 million po pulation regional area of Lombardia (Italy), for which mutation prevalence information is limited. From 2002 to 2013, our Unit of Genetics analyzed 3369 individuals for CFTR mutations, using reverse dot blot based commercial diagnostic kits with a detection rate ranging from 75% to 85%. The laboratory successful ly accomplished National Health system (ISS) sponsored external quality control program since 2003. Most of the individuals were tested for CF in the context of clinical examinations for infertility or as partners of known carriers. Additional cases represented symptomatic patients with suspec ted cystic fibrosis or prenatal diagnosis testing. We detected 147 mutated alleles (4.3% CF carrier frequency). Frequency of individual mutations were F508del (40.1%), G542X (11.6%), N1303K (8.8%), 2789+5G >A (6.8%), 2183AA >G (6.1%). Additional 16 mutations comprised 26.6% of mutated alleles.

22113,"A2756G is a common polymorphism related to the methionine synthase (MTR). Since it has been suggested a role for the folate pathway in chro mosome 21 nondisjunction, many studies have demonstrated a relationship between MTR A2756G and Down syndrome (DS). However, the data from these studies have shown conflicting results. Therefore, we performed this meta analysis to derive a precise estimation of this association. Studies were searched from PubMed up to January, 2014 and were eligible if they included case mothers (DSM) that gave birth to at least one child with DS, and controls mothers (CM) that have given birth to children without abnor malities. Pooled odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals were esti mated by fixed or random effects models. Heterogeneity among studies was evaluated using Q test and I 2 statistic. Publication bias was examined by a BeggÃ¢ÂÂs (funnel plot) and EggerÃ¢ÂÂs tests. Sensitivity analysis were performed by using allelic, dominant, recessive and codominant genetic models, Hardy Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) and ethnicity. Eight case control studies (987 DSM and 1,334 CM) were included. No association evidence has been found, neither in the overall analysis, nor in the stratified analysis by ethnicity (ORs with P > 0.05). The shape of funnel plots was symmetrical in almost all gene tic models. There is no evidence of heterogeneity, the genotype distributions of the controls of all studies were consistent with HWE and sensitivity ana lysis indicated robustness of our results. Taken together, our meta analysis suggested that MTR A2756G polymorphism did not contribute as an inde pendent risk factor of DS. ABSTRACTS POSTERS ESHG 2014 | MILAN, ITALY | WWW. ESHG.

22114,"Background: The kernel machine based regression is an efficient approach to region based association analysis aimed at identification of rare gene tic variants. However, it is computationally complex. The running time of kernel based association analysis becomes especially long for samples with genetic (sub)structures, thus increasing the need to develop new and effec tive methods, algorithms, and software packages. Results: We have developed a new R package called Fast Family Based Se quence Kernel Association Test (FFBSKAT) for analysis of quantitative traits in samples of related individuals. This software implements a score based variance component test to assess the association of a given set of single nu cleotide polymorphisms with a continuous phenotype. In the development of FFBSKAT , we applied several analytical and algorithmic improvements to speed up the analysis without any loss of accuracy. We compared the performance of our software with that of two existing software for family based sequence kernel association testing, namely, AS KAT and famSKAT , using the Genetic Analysis Workshop 17 family sample. Results demonstrate that FFBSKAT is several times faster than other avai lable programs, while being similarly accurate. With respect to the available analysis modes, we combined the advantages of both ASKAT and famSKAT and added new options to empower FFBSKAT users. Conclusion: The FFBSKAT package provides fast, accurate, and easy to use method to perform kernel machine based regression association analysis of quantitative traits in samples of related individuals.

22115,"Nunavik comprises the northern part of Quebec, with 90% of its habitants being Inuit. The modern Inuit of Nunavik came from the Thule people from coastal Alaska and traveled eastward along the Arctic tree line and reached Nunavik around 1500 AD as they became the ancestors of current Inuit residents. In this study, we performed exome sequencing on 113 Nunavik Inuit, using Agilent SureSelect V4 capture kit and Illumina HiSeq platform. Standardized data processing is used to extract all exonic variants. We per formed preliminary analysis in order to identify Inuit specific novel or rare nonsynonymous variants. The analysis yielded 62 protein changing variants which have allele frequency over 0.5 in Inuit while less than 0.01 in other po pulations. Among these, a variant p. P479L in the Carnitine Palmitoyltrans ferase 1A (CPT1A) gene is the most prominent one with allele frequency 0.94. This variant is absent in non Inuit populations, which frequency also appears to be the highest in Nunavik when compared to other Inuit popula tions. Further analysis revealed Nunavik Inuit also have significantly higher mutation burden in other carnitine acyltransferase family genes compared to non Inuit populations such as Asian and Caucasian. The specific genetic profile of Nunavik Inuit with higher number and frequency of damaging va riants in genes regulate lipid metabolism such as carnitine acyltransferase genes may be associated with the adaptation to their special diet and living environment in the extreme cold climate. Understanding the role of Inuit unique variant(s) is very important to the study of Inuit special health care.",2014

To understand the genetic component of food preferences we used two phase approaches: PHASE1: association of bitter taste receptors and coffee liking and PHASE 2: two step GWAS of 42 diffe rent food likings. PHASE1 revealed a significant association between coffee liking and H212R variant of TAS2R43 gene. Moreover, this variant is also associated with dif ferent thresholds in caffeine perception. For PHASE 2 2311 Italian subjects were used for the discovery step while 1755 from Europe and Central Asia for replication.

In the present study, we explored the association of FTO rs1421085 gene polymorphism with obesity, MetS, T2DM and other biochemical pa rameters in a larger cross sectional population based random sample of Turkish Adults (TARF Study). Methods: Genotyping was performed using the Taqman Sistem (ABI PRISM 7900 HT) in 1977 adult individuals (mean age 50.1ÃÂ±12.0; 48.3% male). Results: The frequency of the FTO risk allele (C) was 0.42, and the genotype distribution was in Hardy Weinberg equili brium. Not women but men, carriers of C allele of the rs1421085 polymor phism were at increased risk for the presence of MetS (OR , 1.52; 95% CI: 1.13 to 2.04), elevated insulin level (8.31 ÃÂ± 1.04, p,0.013), adjusted for age, smoking status, alcohol consumption, and physical activity.

22119,"The GLI2 transcription factor is a major effector protein of the sonic hedge hog pathway and it is suggested to play a key role in pituitary development. GLI2 mutations cause holoprosencephaly or holoprosencephaly like fea tures. In some cases heterozygous GLI2 mutations have been associated with hypopituitarism without other anomalies. However GLI2 is not routi nely screened in pituitary hormone disorders. The aim of this study was to determine the frequency of GLI2 mutations in patients with combined pitui tary hormone deficiency (CPHD) in Italian patients that resulted negative for mutations in other causative genes (PIT1, PROP1, HEXS1, LHX3,LHX4 ). In this analysis, we screened the entire gene in 75 CPHD patients. Primers were specifically designed for the 13 coding exons that were analysed by direct sequencing in 18 separate fragments. We identified two novel mis sense mutations: c.731A>T in exon5 leading to the amino acid substitution p. Asp244Val and c.1157C>T in exon7 resulting in the change p. Pro386Leu. These two variants were absent in about 13.000 individual present in the Exome Variant Server. Both these mutations were predicted as probably damaging using the online tool Polyphen v2, with a high score (1.00 for Asp244Val and 0.923 for p. Pro386Leu). They fall within the NH2 terminal repressor domain and an in vitro functional analysis will help to clarify their significance. These preliminary results are encouraging and we are planning to increase the number CPHD patients and extend the analysis also to Isolated Growth Hormone Deficiency (IGHD).",2014
22120,"Given the high prevalence of diferent forms of dyslipidemia in Mexican po pulation, in contrast to European populations, it has been suggested that genetic susceptibility in this population is probably related to its indigenous component as a result of adaptive processes related to energy savings. It is therefore of great importance to identify the genetic variation of the native Mexican population. In this study, 319 individuals from four indigenous po pulations (174, 70, 25 and 50 from Nahua, Maya, Totonac and Zapotec, re spectively) were included. Genotyping was performed using Affymetrix SNP 6.0 microarray. The analysis included a local ancestry estimation to remove segments infered to be of European origin and mixed linear models using EMMAX, adjusted for age, gender and two principal components. Two steps of quality control were performed, before and after the European segments were removed. Log transformed values of tryglecides (TG), total choleste rol (TC) and HDL cholesterol (HDL) were analyzed. By removing segments of European origin in the analysis we identify three suggestive signals, one for each trait. For HDL, TC and TG, an association was found in intergenic regions on chromosome 11 (pÃ¢ÂÂ¤9.5x10 6), chromosome 21 (pÃ¢ÂÂ¤8.8x10 5) and chromosome 2 (pÃ¢ÂÂ¤6.1x10 5), respectively. In the three cases, the risk allele frequency is 20%, 16% and 10% higher in Indigenuos population than in European population.

22121,"Standard methods for assessing significance in Genome wide Association Studies (GWAS) are generally too stringent as they are based on controlling the Family Wise Error Rate. The FDR (False Discovery Rate) approach provi des a more realistic and less stringent alternative. However, controlling the FDR for correlated entities is difficult without making specific assumptions on the correlation structure that may not be realistic. In this study, we define an FDR like criterion (global FDR) for assessing statistical significance of SNPs in GWAS accounting for correlation (Linkage Disequilibrium) between neighboring SNPs. The criterion extends the local FDR criterion of Efron and ensures control of the False Discovery Proportion (FDP) under arbitrary correlation structure. We develop a fast and easily scalable Gibbs type itera tive algorithm to approximate the posterior class membership probabilities that are otherwise hard to compute in general. Unlike the non parametric estimation approach used in local FDR, we use a parametric three group normal mixture model for SNP Z scores with a known correlation matrix. Using simulations under different correlation scenarios, we found that the global FDR approach performs significantly better than local FDR, both in terms of power and accurate control of the type I error (FDP). We also con sidered a sequential procedure to select the most strongly associated SNPs from independent (non redundant) regions of the genome discarding cor related surrogates in the same LD region. We assessed the sensitivity and specificity of our single step and sequential SNP selection strategies. The methods were also validated against known associated regions using pu blished GWAS data from the Collaborative Association Study of Psoriasis.",2014

Among these, one patient with only severe growth retardation carried the smallest deletion encompassing HMGA2. The aim of this study was to investigate the involve ment of HMGA2 in ISS through the search for mutations/deletions and per form an association study between the HMGA2 SNPs and ISS. One hundred four patients (48 males and 56 females) with height ranging from 3,8 and 2 SDS were analyzed by direct sequencing and MLPA.

Regarding SNPxSNP interactions, four interactions were found in SLSJ at p<1.0X10 4 and one of those was replicated in EGEA for ato py (p,0.002, combined p,3.62X10 7) between rs2241343 of IL1RAP and rs10208708 of IL1R1 ). The observed SNP associations in the combined SLSJ and EGEA samples and the SNPxSNP interaction suggest that genes involved in the IL1R2 activities play a role in asthma and, especially in its allergic component.",2014
22130,", Novara, Italy. Mutations within the pseudo autosomal Short stature Homeobox gene (SHOX, Xp22.33 and Yp11.3) and the downstream enhancer are among the few known causes of Idiopathic Short Stature (ISS). Routine diagnostic te sting for the genetic alterations in this gene is carried out in ISS patients, selected with strict criteria regarding the phenotype, who generally show a good response to GH treatment. We analysed 217 ISS patients by sequencing and MLPA to screen for deletion/duplication in the coding sequence and the downstream enhancer region. Among these patients, 90 were severe short stature with a height SDS ranging from 3.9 to 2.0 and 127 patients had a milder phenotype with a height SDS ranging from 1.9 to 0.9. The age at diagnosis was 8.6ÃÂ±3.9 and did not differ significantly between the two groups. Mutations were identified in 7 patients (7.7%) with the most severe phenotype and in 7 patients (5.5%) with mild short stature. There was no significant difference in the mutation number, types and the extension of the detected deletions between the two groups. All the available relatives of the probands were analysed for segregation analysis. Consequently to the high recombination frequency within PAR1 region we observed several SHOX mutations moving from the Y to X chromosome and vice versa. This must be taken into consideration in genetic counselling. Notably, this study revealed the presence of SHOX mutations in individuals with mild short stature with a frequency comparable to that observed in ISS selected with the stringent classical criteria.",2014
22131,"Aim: This study aims to characterize the genetic variability within Italian population and the level of inter population variation between the Mediter ranean basin and the Italian peninsula. Methods: A total of 314 samples, collected from the Italian peninsula and Sardinia island were genotyped, with more than 2,370,000 single nucleoti de polymorphisms investigated. Newly acquired data were analyzed tog ether with the already available genome wide data sets of individuals of the Mediterranean basin. Several analyses have been performed to investigate intra e inter population variability. Results: The analysis highlighted that Italy is one of the genetically most diverse region within Southern Europe. These results may be due to the countryÃ¢ÂÂs complex demographic history, to the large longitudinal extension of the territory and because of its position as a sort of natural bridge in the center of the Mediterranean basin. Conclusion: We confirmed the high genetic diversity of some areas within Italy, such as Sardinia, and of other populations located along boundaries of the Italian territory. We showed that the current genetic landscape of the Italian Peninsula may be explained by isolation by distance rather than a barrier to gene flow and may also reflect a genetic exchange for the Southern Italian populations bet ween the 2 coasts of the Mediterranean basin.",2014
22132,"Background: Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is an autosomal dominant disease that leads to markedly elevated low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDLC) levels and high risk for premature coronary artery disease (CAD). Despite well established criteria for clinical diagnosis, it is estimated that in most European countries only around 5% of FH are identified. One hypo thesis is that FH is simply overlooked in the large number of unselected CAD patients. Moreover, variable LDLC levels and small family sizes may hamper the clinical diagnosis. Around 90% of known FH disease causing mutations are found in the LDLR gene. Hence, systematic molecular genetic screening of the LDLR gene in patients with premature CAD may improve diagnosis and allow preventive treatment of mutation carriers. Aim: To evaluate the frequency of FH, we screened LDLR gene for delete rious mutations in 256 unselected CAD patients with disease manifestation before the age of 50 years. Methods and Results: We filtered for rare (<1% 1000G) and non synony mous variants. Around 6% of the screened CAD patients carried deleterious variants in the LDLR gene. The 10 variants were confirmed using Sanger sequencing and validated by co segregation. Nine are reported to cause FH. One of the reported variants (rs45508991) was found in six unrelated CAD patients. This variant shows incomplete co segregation and is also found in internal control samples. Some of the identified LDLR variants were also found in family members without a known manifestation of CAD but eleva ted LDLC levels. Conclusion: These results underline the need for molecular genetic scree ning to diagnose FH and to allow timely preventive treatment. ABSTRACTS POSTERS ESHG 2014 | MILAN, ITALY | WWW. ESHG.

22133,"Homozygosity disequilibrium (HD), a non random sizable run of homo zygosity in the human genome, has been found related to the evolution of populations and able to confer susceptibility to diseases. In this study, we characterized HD in global populations based on the whole genome sequen cing data of 1,092 individuals from 14 populations of the 1000 Genomes Project. The whole genome homozygosity intensity was estimated by using LOHAS (Yang et al, Genetic Epidemiology, 2011). Using the homozygosity intensity we identified common genomic regions undergoing HD. We found a high proportion of regions of HD to be population specific but also iden tified functionally important regions of HD shared by multiple populations. Genetic differentiation of global populations can be characterized using the patterns of HD. In summary, this large scale whole genome sequencing study derives the distribution of HD in the human genome and proves that HD carries genetic information of human population important for studying genetic background. The information also provides important clues for the differential disease prevalence and drug responses in populations.",2014

MIF, a lymphokine, regulates innate immune response by up regulating the expression of TLR4, suppressing the p53 activity and has been shown to be involved in malaria pathogenesis. In this study, the possib le effect of MIF variations on malaria susceptibility was investigated by re sequencing the complete MIF gene along with 1 kb each of 5Ã¢ÂÂ² and 3Ã¢ÂÂ² region in 425 individuals from malaria endemic regions of the Orissa and Chhattisgarh states of India. The subjects comprised of 160 cases of severe malaria, 101 of mild malaria and 164 ethnically matched asymptomatic controls. Data were statistically compared between cases and controls for their possible asso ciation with Plasmodium falciparum malarial outcome. It is the first study, which shows that the allele A (rs34383331 TÃ¢ÂÂ>Ã¢ÂÂA ) in ncRNA is significantly associated with increased risk to P . falciparum malaria [severe: ORÃ¢ÂÂ,Ã¢ÂÂ2.08, pÃ¢ÂÂ,Ã¢ÂÂ0.002 and mild: ORÃ¢ÂÂ,Ã¢ÂÂ2.09, PÃ¢ÂÂ,Ã¢ÂÂ0.005].

We present the largest population based epi demiological study to date using data provided by the European Surveil lance of Congenital Anomalies (EUROCAT) network of congenital anomaly registries. The study population consisted of 191 cases of Meckel Gruber syndrome identified between January 1990 and December 2011 in 34 Eu ropean registries. The mean prevalence of Meckel Gruber syndrome was 2.6 per 100 000 births. The prevalence was stable, but regional differences were observed. There were 145 (75.9%) terminations of pregnancy after prenatal diagnosis, 13 (6.8%) fetal deaths, 33 (17.3%) live births and of the se 11 (33%) neonatal deaths. In addition to cystic kidneys (97.7%), ence phalocele (83.9%) and polydactyly (87.3%), frequent features include other central nervous system anomalies (68.8%), fibrotic/cystic changes of the liver (65.5% of cases with post mortem examination) and orofacial clefts (31.8%). Various other anomalies were present in 64 (37%) patients. As nowadays most patients are detected very early in pregnancy when liver or kidney changes may not yet be developed or may be difficult to assess, none of the anomalies should be considered obligatory for the diagnosis. Most ca ses (90.2%) are diagnosed prenatally at 14.3ÃÂ±2.6 (range 11 36) gestational weeks and pregnancies are mainly terminated, reducing the number of live births to one fifth of the total prevalence rate.

Later age at menopause has been associated with decreased risk of cardio vascular diseases and increased life expectancy, but associations with diabe tes are controversial and no genetic links have been reported. Additionally, smoking lowers and obesity raises menopausal age, which might disturb the seen associations. Stolk et al. reported of 17 genetic polymorphisms which associate with menopausal age (Nat Genet. 2012). We constructed a genetic score of menopausal age by summing the reported effect sizes (years/allele) of these polymorphisms in four Finnish cohorts (FINRISK1997, PredictCVD, Health2000 and Corogene) and studied its associations to common diseases and their risk factors. Linear, logistic and survival analysis corrected by age and geographical variables were performed in individual cohorts and com bined in meta analysis. One year increase in the genetic score (range 2.3 3.1 years) associated significantly with future diabetes in women (N,2831, hazard ratio,1.46, P,0.0083) but not in men (P,0.3). Interestingly, the genetic score asso ciated nominally (P<0.05) with prevalent diabetes in men (N,5547, odds ratio,0.87, P,0.042) but no association was seen in women. In women no minal association of higher menopausal age score was seen also with higher triglyceride levels and lower HDL cholesterol. Controlling for BMI and smo king did not affect these associations. Our results suggest that the genetic variants associated with the timing of menopause in women have different effects on metabolism in different gen ders. In women polymorphisms raising menopausal age raise also the risk of future diabetes 1.5 fold whereas in men the same variants have a slight protective effect on prevalent diabetes.",2014

Common variant effects have been thoroughly scrutinised, but the impact of low frequency (LF) va riants (minor allele frequency (MAF) <5%) remains largely unexplored. Here we report an exome wide association study of metabolite concentra tions in 4,522 healthy individuals (age 29 53 years, 55% women) from the population based Oxford Biobank study. Approximately 230,000 markers were genotyped using the Illumina HumanExome Beadchip and tested for association with 123 metabolites (80 lipoproteins, 15 lipids, 22 low molecular weight metabolites, and 6 ratios related to fatty acid saturation) quantified by nuclear magnetic resonance of serum samples. After log nor malisation, inverse normalised residuals were generated adjusting for age, gender, and principal components. A linear mixed model was used assuming an additive genetic effect. In the single marker analyses, we identified 15 loci with genome wide significant associations (p<5x10 8) for one or more metabolites. For two of the loci, the strongest signal involved a LF marker.

Here we retrieved 788 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in all pre and mature miRNA sequences and syste matically investigated their association with 17 cardiometabolic traits. We used data of the largest meta analyses of genome wide association studies (GWAS) on glycemic hemostasis indices, lipid traits, blood pressure, corona ry artery disease, type 2 diabetes, and anthropometric measures including information up to 133,000 individuals.

22141,"Sequencing large number of individual genomes at high coverage, which is needed for population genetics studies, is still economically challenging despite substantial reduction in cost of NGS in recent years. An alternative approach is to sequence DNA from pools of individuals which has other po tential benefits like: needing less DNA from each single individual and less time in sample preparation. We have developed a robust strategy for the analysis of DNA sequencing data from pooled individuals and the calculation of allele frequency (AF) of identified sequence variations. We used CRISP [1] to call the variants, AN NOVAR to annotate them, and custom R scripts to calculate AF. We applied this strategy in targeted re sequencing (1.9Mb) of 600 (12 individuals * 50pools) Italian Multiple Sclerosis (MS) patients. For 129 variants, AFs have been independently validated by genotyping the single individuals with SNP array. For each pool, the comparison of AFs in NGS pool data and those at the single individual level with SNP array shows an excellent concordance between the two methods: mean correlation R 2,0.976 ÃÂ± 0.004, and mean delta frequencies , (2.5 ÃÂ± 0.2)*10 2. Moreover, the comparison of AF with that of 1000 genomes (European individuals) for further 5980 SNPs showed an excellent concordance: mean difference of AF , (3.07ÃÂ±.05)*10 2. Overall, we show that pooling the samples for population genetics and disease as sociation studies is a robust and cost and time saving alternative to single sample NGS analysis.

DE SIGN: SNP microarray genotyping and whole genome sequencing (WGS) in 4 MS patients and 4 unaffected individuals belonging to an Italian multiplex family descending from a first cousin marriage were performed. RESULTS: We identified 437 variants with high functional impact, two of which under one of the two LOD peaks on chromosome 8p21.2 and 11q23.3. The first one is in the OR8G5 gene, an olfactory receptor gene under positive selection, while the second one falls within the GRAMD1B gene, causing an aminoacid substitution (S601P). This second variant is not present in dbSNP and in the 1,000 Genome project, and segregates within the family, being homozygote in 3 affected and heterozygote in the left MS patient. Sanger sequencing con firmed the segregation with the disease. GRAMD1B is a very conserved gene from yeast to human. It encodes a membrane protein, which is part of the GRAM containing domain family protein. In the mouse it is highly expressed in the CNS and in specific immune cell subtypes, like dendritic cells and neu trophils.

22143,", Turin, Italy. Multiplex families are a powerful tool to investigate heritability of genetic components in complex disease. Heritability can be investigated using gene expression analysis with specific challenges. Previously developed approa ches were focused on identifying significant genes across families but each family can present different genetic makeup producing heterogeneous gene expression. Moreover it is important to disentangle the strong genetic com ponent of gene expression from the disease effect or other factors affecting gene expression, such as environmental exposures. We developed a statistical method for the analysis of gene expression data from single family studies to minimize the problem in interpreting these data. We applied the Ornstein Uhlenbeck model previously used to descri be evolutionary processes. The model has been transferred to a context in which the quantitative trait has different values in diseased and healthy individuals and it is defined by trees derived from family pedigrees to ex plicitly model the inheritance of gene expression, thus to identify those ge nes that are affected by the disease status. In order to validate the method, simulated datasets were generated starting from a family pedigree taking into accounts the genetic component and the disease status of every gene for every individual. We also used a real dataset from a family pedigree with 4 multiple sclerosis affected individuals. The results obtained on simulated datasets reports that the OU model provides increased sensitivity with re spect to traditional gene expression analysis approaches. The analysis of the MS affected family also identified genes and pathways relevant to the disease.",2014
22144,"The genetic basis of complex diseases often involves multiple linked causati ve loci. Under such a disease etiology, assuming one disease locus in linkage disequilibrium mapping is likely to induce bias and lead to efficiency loss in disease locus estimation. An approach is needed for simultaneously locali zing the positions of multiple functional loci. However, due to the increasing number of parameters accompanying disease loci, these estimates can be computationally infeasible. To circumvent this problem, we propose to esti mate the main and gene gene interaction effects and a nuisance parameter at the disease loci separately through a linear approximation. Estimates of the genetic effects are entered into a generalized estimating equation to estima te disease loci, and the procedure is conducted iteratively until convergence. The proposed method provides estimates and confidence intervals (CIs) for the disease loci, the genetic main effects, and the interaction effects between loci, with the CIs for the disease loci providing useful regions for further fine mapping. We apply the proposed approach to a data example of case control studies. Results of the simulations and data example suggest that the developed method performs well in terms of bias, variance, and coverage probability, regardless of the underlying number of disease loci.",2014

We demonstrate that MX2 evolved adaptively in mammals with distinct sites representing selection targets in rodents and primates; selection mainly involved residues in loop 4, previously shown to carry antiviral determinants. Modeling data indicated that positively selec ted sites form a continuous surface on loop 4, which folds into two antipar allel ÃÂ± helices protruding from the stalk domain. Population genetic analy ses demonstrated that natural selection operated on MX2 during the recent history of human populations: distinct selective events drove the frequency increase of two haplotypes in populations of Asian and European ancestry. The Asian haplotype carries a susceptibility allele for melanoma; the Eu ropean haplotype is tagged by an intronic variant. Analyses performed on three independent European cohorts of HIV 1 exposed seronegative indivi duals with different geographic origin and distinct exposure route showed that the ancestral allele of the intronic variant protects from HIV 1 infection with a recessive effect (combined p value , 1.55x10 4).

22146,"With the advances in next generation sequencing (NGS) technology, a huge amount of data on high dimensional genomic variant was generated and the association of rare variants with complex disease was analyzed for finding the etiology of disease. A variety of statistical approaches for the analysis of rare variants were developed in population based designs. However, many common diseases such as cancer, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, immune disorders and psychiatric disorders are known to cluster in pedigrees. Re cently, many researches have modified existing population based methods for detecting the family based association of rare variants such as family based collapsing methods, family based functional principal component analysis (FPCA) and extended FBAT method. Rare variants may provide contributions to detect disease gene, however, the existence of noisy signals reduced the power of association. In this study, we modified the wavelet based test in family based design to increase power by suppressing noise and therefore reducing false positives. Using simulations with several types of data structure, our proposed method generated a reasonable type I error rate and a comparable or better power (0.4~0.7). We demonstrated that our proposed method can increase power relative to other existing association tests (family based smoothing FPCA, family based collapsing methods and extended FBAT) in the presence of genetic heterogeneity.

Albinism is an heterogeneous group of inherited genetic diseases present at birth. This disorder can affect all ethnic backgrounds with an overall pre valence of approximately 1/17.000 people but prevalence of the different forms of Albinism varies considerably worldwide. It can be classified as Ocu lar Albinism (OA1) caused by mutations in the GPR143 gene located on the X chromosome, or as Oculocutaneous Albinism (OCA) an autosomal reces sive inherited condition. OCA1 4 forms are recognized based on the expres sion of mutations in four different genes: TYR, OCA2, TYRP1 and SLC45A2 . A cohort of 158 OCA or OA1 subjects were recruited from the Medical Genetic Unit and Department of Pediatric Ophthalmology of Niguarda CaÃ¢ÂÂ Granda Hospital of Milan (Italy) and characterized for TYR, OCA2, TYRP1, SLC45A2 and GPR143 gene defects, associated to the different phenotypes, in order to describe their frequencies variation in Italian population. We identified TYR mutations in 83 subjects (66,6% missense, 11,1% nonsense, 8,5% fra meshift, 2,6% deletions in frame, 9,2% splicing mutations and 2% exons deletion), OCA2 mutations in 34 subjects (70,2% missense, 5,2% frameshift, 15,8% splicing mutations and 8,8% exon deletions), TYRP1 mutations in 4 patients (42,9% missense and 57,1% nonsense mutations), SLC45A2 muta tions in 12 patients (63,66% missense, 4,55% nonsense, 22,74% frameshift and 9.1% splicing mutations) and GPR143 mutations in 7 subjects (14,3% missense, 14,3% nonsense, 42,8% frameshift, 14,3% splicing mutations and 14,3% exon deletions).

While collecting phenotypes related to smell in six countries along the Silk Road, we found an increased rate of failure to discriminate odorants in individuals from Tajikistan respect to the other countries. Using haplotype based association we linked this to a 15 kb regi on within olfactory receptor gene cluster on chromosome 6 (p value 3.86e 05). This region is embedded in the largest intron of OR5V1 and is down stream OR11A1 and upstream OR12D3. We also analysed genetic variability in 1,114 unrelated samples either from the Silk Road and ten other world wide populations at over 300,000 polymorphic sites and characterized po pulation genetic structure of the Silk Road within a worldwide context with a resolution never obtained before. We identified genetic components pecu liar to Central Asia and observed that Tajikistan behaves as an outlier popu lation. Indeed Tajiks share a consistent number of unusually large stretches of homozygosity and have the lowest effective population size (Ne) among the studied populations, most likely as the result of past isolation and/or consanguinity. Altogether these novel findings clarify the complex genetic patterns of the Silk Road populations and suggest that the smell mispercep tion phenotype observed in Tajikistan might be the result of a combination of genetic drift and relaxed selection at the olfactory receptors genes.",2014

22153,"Data from genome wide association (GWA) studies have been used to find the common variants of personality. In a previous study, we reported that neurotransmitters and the olfactory receptor 1A2 gene are associated with neuroticism in a cohort of young Korean women. However, many genetic variants that are highly associated with certain personality traits are still unknown. Here, we report on a meta analysis of GWA data for personality in three cohorts samples (2045 individuals). All participants were of Korean ancestry. Personality traits were measured with the Revised Neuroticism Extraversion Openness Personality Inventory to assess five factors: Neuro ticism, Extraversion, Agreeableness, Openness, and Conscientiousness. In either discovery stage, classical association analyses were performed under an additive model followed by meta analysis using the weighted inverse va riance method. We observed consistent direction of effect and significant association of the NAV2 gene and Agreeableness in either the discovery and combined stage (p,7.85ÃÂ10 7, for meta analysis). NAV2 gene involves in optic nerve development and sensory perception of smell and sound. We previously reported that the sensory system may play an important role in personality, and the present study leads to the same conclusion. The sensory system affects personality as a filter of the acceptance system, which may have an advantage to reconstruction.

By simulations of genotype data under the null hypothesis we assess our fra mework, in order to affirm that it correctly controls for the type 1 error rate. By a power study we ascertain, that structured association testing using our framework displays reasonable power. We compare the results from our methods with those obtained from a logistic regression model with prin cipal component covariates.

22155,"Epidemiological studies reported positive associations of circulating IGF I and IGF II, and inverse associations of IGF binding protein 3 (IGFBP 3) with prostate cancer risk, whilst IGFBP 2 has been associated with low grade di sease. However, systematic review findings have been inconsistent which may reflect confounding or reverse causality. We examined the causal role of IGF I, IGF II, IGFBP 2 and IGFBP 3 in prostate cancer using multiple genetic variants to construct allelic scores as instruments for measured circulating IGFs and IGFBPs, in a Mendelian randomization approach. We investigated 1131 SNPs, previously reported to be associated with IGFs and IGFBPs, in ~700 population controls from the ProtecT study. We gene rated allelic scores that consisted of the most strongly and exclusively as sociated SNPs with each biomarker. Finally, we used the allelic scores and in strumental variable analysis to estimate the causal effect of IGFs and IGFBPs on prostate cancer in ~40,000 cases and controls from 21 studies included in the international PRACTICAL consortium. IGF I and IGF II were positively associated with prostate cancer risk. The estimated causal odds ratios for the effect of a standard deviation (SD) in crease in circulating IGF I and IGF II was 1.15 (95% CI 1.06, 1.26) and 1.14 (95% CI 1.02, 1.26), respectively. Notably, IGF II increased risk for advan ced and high grade disease. Conversely, IGFBP 2 and IGFBP 3 were not as sociated with prostate cancer susceptibility. In conclusion, this Mendelian randomization study provides additional support for a causal relationship between IGF I and IGF II and prostate cancer risk.",2014
22156,"In the last decade there has been substantial progress in identifying genetic loci associated with complex phenotypes but limited progress in using geno mic information to predict phenotypic performance. In this study, we assess the advantage of using previously published results to inform genomic pre dictors of complex traits. Our goal is to compare model performance with respect to trait architecture and latent population structure. We consider linear, additive models with different sparsity levels, either learned from the data using lasso or elastic nets, or determined a priori by considering mar kers and their corresponding effects from large meta analysis association studies. We characterise the predictive signal captured by each model and explore whether prediction accuracy can be increased by combining these simpler predictors into a meta model. We evaluate predictive performance using height, body mass index and high density lipoproteins in two population cohorts, originating in Croatia and Scotland. We examine how to maximise prediction accuracy when the tar get individuals come from the same or a different population to the training samples. Our results demonstrate that between population prediction is possible using samples from the target population to perform model selec tion, subject to sample size and trait architecture. Furthermore, we show that a model combining the predictions from penalised regression with me ta analysis based polygenic scores performs better than either model on its own. Our findings suggest that incorporating previous results into statistical models as well as exploiting the predictive signal from latent data structure can lead to improved predictions of complex traits.",2014

Subsequently, statistical methods such as SKAT are used to compa re case and control data in various ways. For GWAS, the use of datasets from different sources for cases and controls has been adequately addressed. For NGS, the role of data quality is less clear. To test our ability to perform rare variant association, we set up a pilot experiment, including 64 samples with juvenile myoclonic epilepsy, a multifactorial disorder, 64 with epileptic encephalopathy, a presumed monogenic disorder, and 64 healthy controls, in the same way as a larger experiment for a set of 348 genes. We analysed whether batch effects and other lab variables could affect the outcome of the association. Between two series of library preparation about five months apart diffe rences in coverage and complexity were visible, as well as differences in the number of detected variants, especially rare variants.

22158,"For the past years genome wide association analysis provided progress in detection of common genetics variants contributing to variation in many common disorders and quantitative traits. However, for many traits, geno me wide significant associations did not result in the establishment of the causal underlying variants. Now, whole exome resequencing of large popu lation samples and formation of databases of annotated functional variants may help to solve this problem. Causal functional variants with a large effect on the variation of traits are rare in populations, but can be aggregated in fa milies. Analysis of samples from isolated populations makes possible to de tect genetically informative families where rare variants co segregate with diseases or traits. To facilitate a search for families with aggregation of the rare variants of interest from extended pedigrees or samples from isolated population and then to test its co segregation with trait by the methods of linkage analysis we developed a software LARA (Linkage Analysis of Rare Allele). LARA combine commonly used package for linkage analysis MERLIN (Abecasis et al 2002) and PedCut software (Liu et al 2008) for the pedigree splitting into a set of sub pedigrees. LARA searches for rare allele carriers, automatically generates and transfers the data, necessary for the analysis.

22159,Sophisticated techniques have been developed for genome wide associati on studies (GWAS) to correct for population substructure that may cause substantial inflation of test statistics and spurious associations. For rare variants in spatially structured populations the existing methods do not effectively control for stratification. We developed an approach to build up a control group that is most similar to the individuals in the case group considering all exomic variants especially also the rare ones. We show with simulations of real exome data that the power of association studies for rare variants can be optimized if case control groups are similarity matched. We also found that the power could be further improved when we increased the control:case group ratio by adding additional exome data.,2014
22160,"Methods based on the linear regression models are widely used for genome wide association analysis of family based samples. To use these models for region based analysis, a collapsing approach is commonly used. However its power decreases if effects of causal variants have opposite directions. We developed a new method for the region based association analysis of family based samples, using techniques of functional data analysis. The in dividual discrete genotypes and effects of multiple variants in the analyzed region are considered as the continuous data, which can be described by stochastic functions constructed on the physical positions of the variants, using a finite set of basis functions. Thus, under the functional linear model, the genetic effects of the multiple variants are described by coefficients of the basis functions. The null hypothesis of zero values for the coefficients is tested by standard statistical tests. We introduced a covariance matrix defi ned through a relationship matrix in the trait inheritance model to take into account a genetic relationship between individuals. High power of our me thod is provided by the simultaneous consideration of genetic information on not only genotypes of multiple variants, but also their physical positions, and by taking into account related structure of the samples. Our method is implemented in the software package FFB FLM available for free download (http://mga.bionet.nsc.ru/soft/FFB FLM/).This work is supported by RFBR grants 13 04 00272a, 14 04 00126a.",2014
22161,"Consanguineous marriages have been widely practiced, with variable rates, in several global communities depending on religion, culture, and geogra phy. The populations of the Middle East are among those with the highest inbreeding level and frequency of inbred individuals. A genome wide analy ses of 165 unrelated Lebanese has been performed either through the esti mation of LOH (Loss of Heterozygosity) or through the FEstim algorithm depending on SNP frequencies. Relying on these genome wide data that identify regions of homozygosity by descent (HBD), this study was able to estimate total inbreeding levels, remote consanguinity, and population ad mixture and structure. The inbreeding coefficient value was estimated to be 1.6% in offspring of unrelated parents (over 3 generations) and 8% in offspring of first cousins. In either case, the remote consanguinity (RC) value was approximately equal to 0.6% resulting from genetic drift or recurrent consanguineous unions. This RC value suggests that for any unrelated mar riages in Lebanon, the mates could be related as third cousins or as second cousins once removed. Under the hypothesis that 25% of marriages occur between first cousins, the mean inbreeding (F) value of 2.2% found may explain the increased incidence of recessive disease within offspring. The LOH and FEstim genome wide approaches were applied to investigate the genomic similarity of Lebanese communities. Both approaches revealed a unique ancestral population of the four studied communities (Greek Ortho dox, Maronite, Shiite and Sunni).",2014

Analysis using SNPTools identified 51.6 million SNPs. On average, Indian origin individuals have >9.5 million variants, while Chinese animals have >12 million, representing much higher diversity than humans. Current effective population size (Ne) is estimated at 65,000 for Indian origin animals, 79,000 for Chinese origin. Both esti mates are substantially higher than values for humans.

We performed a Tetra primer ARMS PCR to genotype CD40 rs1883832 [C>T] and CD40L rs3092952 [A>G]. Differences of plasma sCD40L concentrations among groups of genotypes were compared by ANOVA followed by Bonferroni correction (significance when P<0.017).Results:Genotype frequencies didnÃ¢ÂÂt deviate from Hardy Weinberg expectations. The distribution of genotypes for CD40L rs3092952 was 68, 43 and 30 for AA+A, AG and GG+G respectively. No difference was observed between the 3 genotypes in sCD40L levels.

We hypothesize that those with TT genotype may express a high amount of CD40 on their surface and thus may capture sCD40L, becoming more activated, thus secreting more sCD40L.

22166,"Family based study designs are regaining popularity because large scale se quencing can help to interrogate the relationship between disease and vari ants too rare in the population to be detected through any test of association in a conventional case control study, but may nonetheless co segregate with disease within families. When only a few affected subjects per family are se quenced, evidence that a rare variant may be causal can be quantified from the probability of sharing alleles by all affected relatives given it was seen in any one family member under the null hypothesis of complete absence of linkage and association. We present a general framework for calculating such sharing probabilities when two or more affected subjects per family are sequenced, and show how information from multiple families can be combined by calculating a p value as the sum of the probabilities of sharing events as (or more) extreme. We also examine the impact of unknown rela tionships and propose methods to approximate sharing probabilities based on empirical estimates of kinship between family members obtained from genome wide marker data. We apply this method to a study of 55 multiplex families with apparent non syndromic forms of oral clefts from four distinct populations. Whole exome sequencing was performed by the Center for In herited Disease Research (CIDR) on two or three affected members from each family.

22167,"Mutations in PPIB, a gene that encodes cyclophilin B, a prolyl cis trans isomerase, cause recessively inherited osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) that ranges in severity from moderately deforming to perinatal lethal. Among Acadians in New Brunswick and Cajuns in Louisiana, who represent geo graphically distinct populations derived from the same ancestral group in France, we identified 2 families from the Acadian group and 2 from Louisia na, both presumed to be from the Cajun group, with severe/lethal OI caused by a homozygosity for a previously unreported PPIB mutation (c.344 1G>T , IVS3 1G>T). All transcripts from this allele use a cryptic acceptor site 5nt into exon 4 that results in a frameshift and mRNA instability. Both Canadian families presented prenatally; the first family had features of a lethal skel etal dysplasia on ultrasound and on autopsy was thought to have perinatal lethal OI. The second family was thought to have a severe moderately de forming OI on ultrasound. The two families from Louisiana presented with clinical diagnoses of perinatal lethal OI. None had mutations in COL1A1 or COL1A2. There is no known consanguinity within these families or relation ships between them. Because of the probable founder effect for PPIB associated recessive OI among Acadians and Cajuns, likely tracing back to early 17 th century France, in pregnancies/children of Acadian/Cajun ancestry (and their antecedents) presenting with severe skeletal dysplasia, PPIB associated OI should be con sidered.

The possibility to use population co horts rather than family structures opens up a multitude of new avenues also for genetic epidemiological research on time to event outcomes.

We introduce an R package (Ã¢ÂÂGSMÃ¢ÂÂ) for heritability estimation, multi locus association testing and genomic prediction of time to event outcomes that is scalable to sequencing data. The package implements a very flexible piece wise constant hazard model that contains an individual specific Gaus sian random effect with an arbitrary covariance structure.

Materials and methods: We performed case control genome wide associa tion study (GWAS) of self reported swallowing symptoms related to dyspha gia. The analysis included 555 community dwelling, unrelated, older adults (mean years of age , 81.4; SD , 5.349) with known phenotype and genetic information consisting of 512 806 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP). Gene based association analyses of these traits was also conducted. The genetic data underwent quality control procedures prior to the study.

We sought to evaluate the prevalence of COL4A3/ A4 mutations among patients presenting with microscopic hematuria (MH), belonging to 91 Hellenic families. Also we studied 28 sporadic patients with MH and four patients with ARAS. We performed functional studies in cultu red podocytes, focusing on the induction of the unfolded protein response (UPR) after overexpression of wild type or mutant COL4 chains. Among 91 families, heterozygous mutations were found in 11 (12,1%). Re stricting the calculation to 68 families with Ã¢ÂÂ¥3 patients with MH, the posi tive finding is 11/68 (16,2%). Three heterozygous mutations were found in three of the 28 sporadic patients (10,7%). Altogether, among 52 hetero zygous patients 17,3% reached end stage kidney disease (ESKD). Of those aged >50 years, 26% reached ESKD, in keeping with previous findings that TBMN is not always benign. Functional studies showed that mutant CO L4A3/A4 chains expressed in podocytes are preferentially retained in the cells, compared to wild type chains. Mutant chains differentially triggered activation of the UPR pathway, as evidenced by activation of BiP , a sensitive ER stress marker. TBMN may emerge as a more frequent cause of ESKD than AS. The ability of mutant chains to elicit the UPR pathway when overexpressed in podocytes may prove of functional significance and prognostic value.",2014

However, there were significant associations between the BTBD9 gene variants and a clinical phenotype of TS. Minor alleles of all three SNPs were found significantly less frequently in patients with ADHD and were more frequent in patients with no comorbidities. There was a borderline statistical significance for minor alleles to be less frequent in patients with severe tics.

As well as ethnic and geographical differences, contribution of multiple genes on the emergence of the disea se makes type 2 diabetes (T2D) even more complicated to understand. It was noted that prominent genes in all of the studies are the genes coding proteins usually functional in pathways related to insulin release or activity. IRS1 and 2, KCNJ11, ABCC8, TCF7L2 and Adiponectin genes which are of prominent genes in literature have been scanned among type 2 diabetic in dividuals living in Konya region and risk allels were determined in our study. For this purpose, patients applied to Selcuk University, Faculty of Medicine, Endocrinology Department and diagnosed with T2D were included. Forty seven SNPs in six gene regions were genotyped among about 200 diabetic and 150 healthy individuals. Association analyses with disease and bioche mical data and genotypes, Hardy Weinberg analyses, genotype phenotype relationship were evaluated statistically. The silent substitution R1273R and exon 16 3t/c of ABCC8 gene, SNP Ã¢ÂÂ11391G ÃÂ Ã¢ÂÂA in proximal promo ter and SNP +276GÃ¢ÂÂT in intron 2 of Adiponectin gene and intronic SNPs rs7903146 and rs12255372 in TCF7L2 gene were significantly associated with T2D (P<0,001). We also found an effect of the E23K variant in KCNJ11 gene on insulin secretion in our population (P<0.05).

Introduction: The precise mechanisms underlying the development and progression of type 2 diabetes have not been elucidated yet; however, a combination of multiple genetic and/or environmental factors contributes to the pathogenesis of the disease. The two main pathophysiological mecha nisms leading to type 2 diabetes are impaired insulin secretion and insulin resistance which have a significant genetic component. TCF7L2 is one of the genes involved in insulin secretion, and the TCF7L2 rs7903146 constitutes the best established risk allele to be associated with diabetes. Therefore, this study was carried out to replicate the previous findings in Iranian po pulation using samples from the Tehran lipid and glucose study (TLGS), a large population based cohort study. Methods: This case control study in cluded 2173 affected patients and 2400 controls selecting among TLGS par ticipants. The genetic variants on transcription factor 7 like 2 (TCF7L2) na mely rs7903146 was genotyped genotyped using the Centaurus (Nanogen) platform in DeCODE genetics. Association of T allele with type 2 diabetes was examined using plink software after age and sex adjustment. Results: In this study, the minor allele (T) of rs7903146 increased risk of type 2 dia betes 1.33 fold higher in case group compared to control group (OR:1.33; p, 1.8E 10). Conclusion: The findings revealed the association between the presence of T allele in rs7903146 and type 2 diabetes among Iranian popu lation which confirmed previous result in other ethnicity.

It is a serious worldwide public health problem which has reached epidemic proportions with an increasing prevalence and ob vious substantial familial clustering. Therefore, T2D has been the subject of numerous medical genetic studies aiming at the elucidation of the genetic mechanisms involved in the disease. Candidate gene studies, genome wide association (GWA) scans and meta analysis of these scans identified several genetic T2D susceptibility loci. We initiated T2D genetic studies in the Cypriot population. We collected a representative number of diabetic and non diabetic samples, extracted DNA and created the first Cypriot T2D DNA Bank. Twenty one already established in other population susceptibility loci were investigated in our population. Four of the 21 tested loci [TCF7L2 rs7901695, FTO rs8050136, HHEX/IDE rs5015480 and SLC30A8 rs13266634] that are among the strongest asso ciated SNPs worldwide have been also associated with T2D susceptibility in our population. Furthermore, 4 statistically significant associations were detected between the following specific variables of the phenotype and the tested loci: 1) age at T2D onset with THADA rs7578597 and TCF7L2 rs7901695, 2) body mass index with FTO rs8050136 and KCNJ11 rs5219, 3) glycosylated haemoglobin levels of patients with ADAMTS9 rs4607103 and 4) cardiovascular disease with TCF7L2 rs7901695.Our findings expanded the genetic assessment of T2D in a distinct popula tion and reconfirmed 4 of the worldwide established loci.

The latter two haplogroups were recognized as West Eurasian ancestry. In principal component analy sis (PCA) some Vedda groups occupied separate positions while some were closely related to South Indian tribal groups. Most interestingly, by viewing PCA from the point of view of the Southeast Asian foragers, it is evident that their closely related groups are the Vedda people. This fascinating genetic footprint is suggestive of yet another piece of evidence of the dispersal of anatomically modern human out of Africa via the southern migration route.

Adipose tissue is a major endocrine organ that contributes to whole body metabolic homeostasis. The role of body fat distribution in the development of obesity related metabolic consequences, such as type 2 diabetes, hyperli pidemia and cardiovascular disease is of great importance. Fat depots from different areas of the body display distinct structural and functional proper ties and have specific roles in pathology. We applied RNA sequencing (RNA Seq) to quantify transcript levels in vis ceral and subcutaneous adipose tissue. RNA was extracted from 81 tissue samples (42 subcutaneous, 39 visceral) of women from the Greek populati on spanning the BMI range (sample collection is ongoing), who underwent bariatric surgery or surgical treatment for non inflammatory disease. RNA Seq was performed on the Illumina HiSeq 2000 platform with paired end 49 bp sequencing. Reads were mapped using the GEM mapper with an average of 27.4 million reads per sample.

We found that though the general po pulation has limited genetic literacy, they are interested in being informed of their genetic risk status. They are generally positive about using genetic information in disease prevention but not about provision of this informa tion to employers and insurers. There is evidence of positive association between perceived risk and cancer screening behaviour such as uptake and mammography, particularly when risk is communicated by categorising into high, medium and low strata. Yet genetic risk feedback particularly that conveying small increases of risk has little or no effect on lifestyle changing behaviour. Also, personalised risk communication is effective in improving knowledge and risk perception of the population.

It is a personalised, communication portal which allows interactions over time, enabling participants to engage in the donation of their tissue samples and per sonal information for research purposes, as much or as little as they choose. The technical architecture of DC includes components that can securely encrypt sensitive data and allow participant consent choices to travel with their data and samples when shared with third parties. In addition to improving trans parency and public trust, this system is of benefit to researchers by streamli ning recruitment, and enabling efficient recontact of participants. The interface facilitates two way communication of information to stimulate a more engaged, informed and scientifically literate participant population whe re individuals can tailor and manage their own consent choices. To date, DC has mainly been developed in the context of biobanking, but it also has potential for use in other domains for a variety of purposes. In this paper we present dynamic consent and show how it can be used as a tool for translational research and personalised medicine.",2014
22191,"Introduction Many findings from NGS diagnostic techniques cannot be in terpreted yet, but may provide medically relevant information in the futu re. However, guidelines on recontacting former patients if new actionable information arises are lacking. Methods As a first step in developing such guidelines, we conducted a systematic literature search on recontacting in clinical genetics in PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and Google Scholar. Our search strategy identified 974 articles in all four databases. Fifty full text articles in English language met our inclusion criteria, and were inclu ded in the review. Results Most literature is from the US (48%), followed by Canada (22%) and Europe (22%). In the literature recontacting is usually not regarded a legal obligation in clinical genetics. Most authors do consider recontacting to be desirable. Many articles argue that the responsibility for recontacting should be shared with the patient. We found no national or in ternational guidelines, except for the 1999 ACMG policy statement on duty to recontact. Only four of the fifty articles described practical experiences with recontacting. These showed that patients were usually positive about the renewed contact. Conclusion Most authors consider recontacting to be desirable. The limited empirical evidence indicates that patients appreciate recontacting. Practical problems of implementing recontacting in clinical genetics are brought forward most often as argument contra imposing a duty to recontact. One of the challenges for the future will be to create ways to overcome these. Legal issues remain important. We therefore consider it important to develop guidelines on this topic for the NGS era.",2014
22192,"Data as well as biological sample international sharing is paramount in health research. While policy declarations from numerous research institu tions and funders encourage such sharing a number of difficulties and needs are identified in practice to Ã¢ÂÂmake it happenÃ¢ÂÂ. This movement in the con text of the availability of large scale sequencing technologies for studying human genomic variation is confronted with legal and ethical aspects re garding privacy, confidentiality, clinically useful information and the duties attached. Issues related to identifiability, consent process and regulation of access challenge the existing framework. The evolving legal framework regarding exchanges of biological samples (no unified legal EU framework for research) and personal data protection (EU Directive in revision) is challenged. Examples from various consortia and projects are analysed to enlighten the different facets into play, from the P3G consortium (Public population projects in genomics and society), the international consortium on cancer genomics, European infrastructures such as BBMRI (Biobanking and Biomolecular Resources Research Infrastructure) or ESGI (European sequencing and genotyping) and other EU projects. The focus will be on Charts, Codes and tools to foster sharing, especially hSERN (human samp le exchange regulation navigator) that gives information on theoretical and practical legal aspects for exchanging biological samples across borders and the BRIF initiative (Bioresource research impact factor) that aims at provi ding ways to recognise the efforts to make available quality bioresources and at measuring their use.

22193,"Personal genomic tests (PGT) for disease risk assessment, based on genome wide association study variants, have been offered directly to consumers (DTC) by several companies since 2007. Concerns regarding their potenti al adverse impact include, among others, lack of counselling, dubious test quality, unnecessary anxiety and medical interventions based on erroneous/ misinterpreted results. To mitigate worries professional education on PGT DTC has been advocated and the central gatekeeper role of family physicians has been highlighted. Relatively few studies have been published on awareness, involvement and attitudes of healthcare providers on DTC marketing of PGT and, to the best of our knowledge, none in Italy. A 2008 CDC survey showed that 42% of healthcare providers were aware of DTC PGT , that 42% of them had at least one patient asking questions about having such a test and 15% had at least one patient who brought test results in the past year. The preliminary results of a 2014 survey in the Emilia Romagna Region (Ita ly), involving solely general practitioners, show that slightly more than 20% of the respondents are aware of DTC PGT and that respectively 85% and 15 % of them feel unprepared or only partly prepared to answer questions about such tests. About 45 % of them have had at least one patient asking questions on purchasing or performed DTC PGT during 2013. These data are coherent with the limited number of Italian companies directly marketing PGT and underscore the critical need to enhance primary physiciansÃ¢ÂÂ infor mation on genomics tests provided outside of the clinical setting.",2014
22194,"Currently, the return of genetic research results to research participants is a hot topic of debate throughout the world, yet no consensus policy has emerged. Regarding genetic research, Japan has government guidelines, en titled Ethical Guidelines for Human Genome/Gene Analysis Research, which have been set by three ministries in March 2001. These guidelines, together with the preceding document formulated by the government in 2000, Fun damental Principles of Research on the Human Genome, set the principle that a research participant has the right to be informed of his/her genetics information resulting from the research. This means that Japan has taken a stance emphasizing the right of research participants to receive their results since 2000. In the recent revision of the 2001 government guidelines, ho wever, the stance of disclosure in principle was also retained, but the newly added stipulations resulted in researchersÃ¢ÂÂ discretion playing a significant ly larger role, due to the strong influence of the Act on the Protection of Personal Information. In this study, we have identified two potential ethical issues, which need to consider in the revised guidelines. One is that they do not actually require researchers to offer opportunities for participants to express these wishes and opinions. The other is that one of the exemptions, which show the situation that researchers do not have to disclose, considers only the promotion of research activity, but not the interests of research par ticipants. Based on these findings, we discuss their implications for interna tional research community. ABSTRACTS POSTERS ESHG 2014 | MILAN, ITALY | WWW. ESHG. ORG 342Back to inde x",2014

22197,"Familial AlzheimerÃ¢ÂÂs disease (FAD), despite representing a rare condition, is attracting a growing interest. In clinical practice, we noticed that individuals with a family history of AD show considerable interest for the availability of genetic tests for early detection of the disease. When informed about the availability of a genetic test for autosomal domi nant mutations (PSEN1, PSEN2, APP genes) some individuals decide to be tested, while other refuse. Those who refuse to take the test are primarily motivated by lack of efficacious therapies. However, both those who deci de to take the test and those who refuse it lament lack of clear information about the clinical development of the condition. Indeed, we found out that, albeit rare, FAD cases are poorly phenotyped. In particular, we performed a systematic review of studies describing the phenotypic features of FAD cases sustained by PSEN2 mutations resulting in largely incomplete and low quality data. Given the incomplete penetrance of some mutations, their variable phenotypic expressivity, and the lack of systematic and accurate phenotyping of FAD cases, the possibility of imple menting genetic counseling procedures is strongly limited. This may also affect the capacity of individuals to react and cope with the communication of the test result should they turn out to be mutation carriers. Available guidelines do not clearly address this issue and thus may not pro vide sufficient guidance for clinicians and counselors. Based also on experi ence in other contexts, we propose criteria to improve FAD cases phenoty ping aiming at enhancing the quality of genetic counseling activities.",2014

In our study, we evaluated the efficacy of the genetic counseling for families with affected children or relatives by a number of parameters, such as change in the conversance of patients and the impact of genetic counse ling on reproductive plans of the patients. The study was conducted in the outpatient department of the Research Centre of Medical Genetics (RCMG), the Russian Academy of Medical Sciences (RAMS), in 2007 2011. We inter viewed 226 respondents aged 17 to 67 years. The survey was conducted be fore and after genetic counseling. Questionnaires have been analyzed using Statistica 10.0 software. We found that the conversance of the risk of an af fected child birth after genetic counseling increased significantly (Wilcoxon test, p <0.05). So did conversance of patients about the possibility of pre natal diagnostics (ÃÂ ÃÂ² distribution, p <0.05). However, when assessing the extent to which the patients increased their understanding of the causes of hereditary diseases (that was assessed by a series of test questions), we did not detect any changes in conversance of patients before and after genetic counseling. We concluded that these issues deserve a special attention when conducting genetic counseling. Also, we found no significant changes in re productive plans of the patients after genetic counseling. Currently, there are many reasons that affect the reproductive plans of the family, in addition to an adequate understanding of the extent and meaning of genetic risk.",2014

In parallel with data sharing practices by clinicians and researchers, recent initiatives have been observed in which individuals are sharing personal genomic data. The involvement of individuals in such initiatives is facilitated by the increased accessibility of personal genomic data, offered by private test providers along with availability of online networks. Personal webpages and on line data sharing platforms such as Free the Data, Consent to Research and Ge nomes Unzipped are being utilized to host and share genotypes, electronic health records and/or family history uploaded by individuals. Although per sonal genomic data sharing initiatives vary in nature, the emphasis on the individualsÃ¢ÂÂ control on their data in order to benefit research and ultimate ly health care has seen as a key theme across these initiatives. In line with the growing practice of personal genomic data sharing, this paper aims to shed light on the potential challenges surrounding these initiatives. As in the course of these initiatives individuals are solicited to individually balance the risks and benefits of sharing their genomic data, their awareness of im plications of personal genomic data sharing for themselves and their family members is a necessity. Furthermore, given the sensitivity of genomic data and the controversies around their de identifiability, potential privacy risks and harms originating from unintended uses of data have to be taken into consideration.",2014

HRF genetic diagnosis is increasingly requested for patients with recurrent inflammatory episodes of unknown origin. More than 10 HRF genes are listed in the Infevers database. An external quality assessment (EQA) program for the primary tested HRF syndromes (FMF, CAPS, TRAPS, MKD) has been provided by the EMQN since 2009. Fifty laboratories, mostly from European countries, participate in the scheme. Data demonstrating improved genetic diagnosis for HRF since 2009 will be presented; genotype error rates have dropped dramatically compa red to a prior 3 year survey (2005 2008). Moreover, with low participation outside Europe, best practice guidelines for the genetic diagnosis of HRF have also been written by HRF genetic and clinical experts, addressing the scope of diagnosis and clinical significance of pathogenic, clinically deba ted, rare, novel or population specific variants. A simple interpretation chart concludes on the contribution of each variant type to the diagnosis of reces sive or dominant HRF disease. Guidelines also addressed minimal details and indication for referral, technical quality assurance measures, variant description nomenclature and recommendation for further genetic testing.

Genetic information is often considered as specific, among other biological information, because of its personal and family dimension. When a person is diagnosed with a serious genetic anomaly, the disclosure of this informa tion can be relevant for other family members when prevention measures or treatment exist. The transmission of this information raises legal issues for professionals: how to preserve confidentiality and privacy of personal me dical information? How to ensure the right to know of the relatives when the information to be disclosed can be of interest for their health? The French legislator tried, in 2004, to draw a balance between these principles by implementing the Ã¢ÂÂgenetic information procedure to family members. The lack of adoption of enforcement decrees made the law not applicable since a revision occurred in the new bioethics law (2011). This procedure tends to favor information of relatives by creating a primary legal obligation for the index subject to inform his family members. It also creates professional obligations notably in the ways this information has to be formalised and disclosed when the subject do not want to communicate it.

However, very few screening programs have been implemen ted around the world to date. In order to assess social desirability of carrier screening for CF, it is important to study views and attitudes of key stakehol ders, such as patients with CF and their family members. The aim of this study was to assess views of adult patients and the parents of children with CF regarding carrier screening for CF. Participants were re cruited from a register of patients at the University Hospital of Ghent. 134 questionnaires were distributed of which 112 were returned (response rate 83.5%). In overall, the attitudes towards carrier screening for CF were positive, with 80% of respondents thinking the procedure entails more ad vantages than disadvantages. Eighty five percent of the respondents belie ve that the screening should be routinely offered to all couples planning a pregnancy, while 72.9% were of the opinion that the procedure should also be provided prenatally. Regarding future pregnancies, 46.1% would them selves choose for preimplantation genetic diagnosis, 43.6% would prefer to conceive naturally followed by a prenatal diagnosis. Others were ready to accept the risk of having an affected child, or opt for an adoption, 5% each.",2014
22213,"Hereditary heart diseases are typically characterized by autosomal domi nant inheritance and delayed cardiac expression. Predictive genetic testing (PGT) is offered to asymptomatic relatives to allow targeted medical care with early therapeutics in order to reduce the risk of complications. Psy chological issues related to PGT are complex and have been poorly studied. To evaluate our practices regarding PGT for hereditary heart diseases and study the behavior of relatives after the first information consultation, of fering a waiting period before blood sampling. We retrospectively studied records from 304 consecutive relatives seen in our department and have requested PGT . Underlying diseases in the families were HCM (60%), DCM (17%), ARVC (15%), LQT (5%), Brugada syndrome (2%) and other (1%). There were 260 adults and 44 minors. At the time of the first consultation, the average age was 37 years, and 83 % of the relatives previously had a car diac checkup. After multidisciplinary consultation, 22 relatives (8%) drop ped out of procedure and 11 relatives (3%) performed blood sampling but did not come back to know their results. Blood sample was delayed for 70% of relatives and immediate for 30%. A total of 21 different genes were ana lyzed and most frequent ones were MYBPC3 (97), MYH7 (77), LMNA (37). A mutation was present in 36% of relatives and absent in 64%. We observed a high level of genetic uptake after initial consultation but a minority of relati ves decided to stop or delay the procedure. These results suggest the benefit of a waiting period before blood sampling. ABSTRACTS POSTERS ESHG 2014 | MILAN, ITALY | WWW. ESHG. ORG 346Back to inde x",2014
22214,"Aim: In preparation for the creating of Danish guidelines regarding predicti ve and presymptomatic genetic testing in minors, we have reviewed existing guidelines and policy papers as well as international conventions. Further more we have reviewed existing literature concerning the psychosocial im pact of testing children. Materials: Guidelines on the topic from four of the largest English speaking genetic associations were reviewed. The Convention on the Rights of the Child and the Convention on Human Rights and Biomedicine were also con sidered. Results: In the reviewed guidelines it is recommended to offer genetic te sting if the test result will be of medical benefit to the child. In some guideli nes emphasis is on immediate benefit. If there is no potential medical benefit it is recommended to defer genetic testing for adult onset disorders until minors are able to decide for themselves. Some guidelines suggest that psy chosocial factors in certain cases can justify genetic testing for adult onset disorders. Requests for genetic testing for childhood onset disorders can usually be met. Thorough genetic counseling and consideration of timing of the test is of importance in the decision making process. Discussion: There is a lack of knowledge about the psychosocial impact of testing children. The recommendations in the reviewed guidelines are based on the classic medical moral principles: Nonmaleficence, beneficence and respect for autonomy. The recommendations are in consistency with international conventions on the field, but statements within these conven tions can be subject to interpretation.

22219,"Background: The need to balance the autonomy of participants and their consent to participate in biomedical research with the fast pace of scientific enquiry is becoming difficult as the number of projects grows and pressure increases at national and international levels to link project resources to fa cilitate access and data sharing. Methods: We undertook a literature review from the perspective of longitu dinal cohort studies and biobanks. We examined existing policy statements, academic literature on re consent, and evidence from re consent exercises. Results: Guidance from policy bodies is vague, suggesting that re consent should be sought if changes are made to the original protocol or if new re search falls outside the scope of the original consent. StakeholdersÃ¢ÂÂ attitudes showed different approaches. Broad consent, with or without an oversight body is a popular alternative, while seeking re consent for every study was also mentioned by a minority. Several alternatives along this continuum have been suggested by commentators and as a result of empirical studies. Actual and potential research participants want re consent when a new use presents increased risks and is for a new unrelated condition, while com mentators also suggest re consent when the research is moving beyond exi sting use, such as for next generation sequencing. Conclusion: Practical difficulties, potential loss of participants and increased costs make re consent for every new study unpractical and in some cases unfeasible. There is a lack of studies investigating actual participants and their positions on re consent and research is needed to inform best practice guidelines for re consent in longitudinal studies.",2014
22220,"50 years ago the Smith Lemli Opitz Syndrome (SLOS, RSH syndrome) was described for the first time in three male patients by David W. Smith, Luc Lemli and John Opitz. It was a clinical description showing microcephaly and hypogenitalism. 30 years later Tint and colleagues found the underlying defect in cholesterol biosynthesis (1994). The gene was identified by a group in Innsbruck (Fitzky et al., 1998), first mutations in SLOS patients have been detected by the same group and also by Wassif et al. (1998). Hence SLOS is a metabolic and malformation disorder caused by mutations in the DHCR7 gene. This gene encodes the ÃÂ±7 sterolreductase. Now more than 130 mu tations are known and all reported patients are included in the DHCR7 da tabase (http://databases.lovd.nl/shared/genes/DHCR7). Mutation spectra are different in European populations. Time since establishment of common founder mutations (c.964 1G>C, p. Trp151* and p. Thr93Met) is long enough (about 100 and 200 generations) to explain frequencies (1:100 for c.964 1 G>C) by genetic drift (Witsch Baumgartner et al., 2007). There are modifiers of clinical severity of SLOS. Depending on SLOS patientÃÂ´s maternal variants apoE 2, 3 or 4 the severity vary significantly (Witsch Baumgartner et al., 2004). The fundamental problem of the disease is the lack of cholesterol during embryogenesis. Regarding therapies adding HMG CoA reductase in hibitor (simvastatin) might ameliorate the severity (Jira et al., 2000; Haas et al., 2007). After 50 years the pathophysiology of SLOS is still not as clear due to multiple functions of cholesterol. To help patients it is still necessary to continue research on SLOS.",2014
22221,"Split hand/foot malformation (SHFM) is a congenital limb defect affecting predominantly the central rays of the hands + feet. SHFM is genetically and clinically heterogeneous with inter and intra familial variability in the clini cal manifestations. Most cases are inherited in an autosomal dominant man ner and a causative genetic alteration is detected in approximately 50% of patients affected. SHFM3 accounts for 20% of cases and is caused by tandem microduplications at 10q24. We report 2 cases of recurrent 4 limb ectrodac tyly with phenotypically normal parents and 1 case of a female with SHFM3 and her difficult attempts at IVF due to an abnormally high number of af fected embryos. Case 1: A brother and sister presented with isolated 4 limb ectrodactyly. Microarray analysis showed a de novo 10q24.32 microdupli cation, which was 434 Kb in size. Case 2: A mother with a child with 4 limb ectrodactyly was 16.5 weeks pregnant when abnormalities of the hands and feet were identified on fetal ultrasound. Microarray analysis confirmed the 10q24.32 microduplication, previously identified in the affected sibling. Case 3: The proband was a mother with SHFM3 and a microduplication at 10q24.32, approximately 540 Kb in size. Preimplantation genetic diagnosis of 16 embryos identified the microduplication in greater than 80% of the embryos. We speculate that SHFM3 may represent a subtype of ectrodactyly that exhibits a higher chance of gonadal mosaicism. Genetic counselling in de novo cases should reflect this observation. Further research of the com plex inheritance of SHFM is essential to providing families with accurate counselling.",2014

22223,"p. A., Busto Arsizio, Italy. Chromosomal mosaicism in chorionic villi (CVS) can be either confined to the placenta (CPM) or generalized to the fetus (TFM). The probability of TFM depends mainly on timing and mechanism generating the mosaicism. Due to the variable distribution of the abnormal cell line, when a mosaic is detected in CVS a confirmatory amniocentesis should be performed to discriminate between CPM or TFM. We present a diagnostic experience on 52,673 CVS combining cytogenetic analysis of cytotrophoblast and mesenchyme and, in case of CVS mosaic, on amniocytes. A CV mosaicism was found in 1.81% of CVS. The stratification by category of chromosome abnormality indicate that mosaics involving 47,+mar or sex chromosome aneuploidies have the highest risk of TFM (35.8% and 31.6%, respectively) while autosomal triso mies and 46,der karyotypes have a lower risk (6.9% and 5.2%, respectively). We will present the risk of TFM stratified by type of chromosome abnor malities distinguishing mosaic (MA) and nonmosaic abnormalities (NMA). Genetic counselling is challenging in case of CVS mosaicism and the need for data to calculate a risk of fetal involvement is vital to refine a personali zed chromosome abnormality based strategy of investigation to reduce the need for follow up amniocentesis. While prenatal diagnosis is destined to become Ã¢ÂÂmolecularÃ¢ÂÂ with microarrays, NIPS and NGS, the large cytogenetic diagnostic experience on CVS presented in this study is helpful to evaluate limits and advantages of the new technologies that must be integrated in pretest and post test counseling.",2014

To date, health care providers have relied on modelled values to counsel pregnant women regarding their age related risks for common aneuploidy syndromes, particularly in younger maternal age categories. The goal of this study was to provide a contemporary update using actual data from a single laboratory to derive specific age related risks for common aneuploidies as well as significant non aneuploidy fetal genetic aberrations. QFQ banded karyotypes from prenatal samples analyzed at a single biome dical from 1994 2012 were analyzed. Selected for study, were samples in which the only indication for karyotype was either maternal age Ã¢ÂÂ¥ 35 or ma ternal anxiety (patients <35 years) with exclusion of additional risk factors, such as maternal serum markers or ultrasound anomalies. 129,263 karyotypes from villi and AF were analyzed. As expected, autosomal aneuploidies and 47,XXY show a statistically significant positive association with maternal age while MX shows a borderline negative association only for CVS. Risk of non aneuploid anomalies compromise a substantial share of chromosomal abnormalities in younger women. We present the rates of fetal aneuploidies and other significant chromosomal anomalies stratified by two periods of gestational age and, when applicable, by maternal age, which have been observed in real clinical practice. As standard prenatal screening strategies currently do not detect these non aneuploidy DNA ab errations, the data presented in this study is critical for informed patient decision making which should be a routine part of genetic counseling in the prenatal setting.

22226,"Genetic medicine is an area of health care that often deals with delivering profound and difficult information; it brings clinicians directly in contact with individuals and families who sometimes have to make very difficult and life changing decisions. Genetic counselling involves the skill of giving infor mation, advice and support to help guide patients through this process. Adjusting to information and assimilating new knowledge can have signi ficant implications for the life decisions patients make. It is now recognis ed as normal for the course of adjustment to involve a range of emotional responses including denial, sadness, anger and guilt before the stage of acceptance is reached. This process can take time, individuals can vary in presentation and sometimes they can get Ã¢ÂÂstuckÃ¢ÂÂ often resulting in unhelpful behavioural consequences and increasing distress. In order to be effective clinicians need to understand this process and be equipped to recognise and respond to emotional responses that may occur within routine consultati ons. This workshop looks specifically at the nature of guilt and shame in the context of genetic medicine. Drawing upon a cognitive behavioural model of emotion we will consider how the difficult and corrosive emotions of guilt and shame can be understood as an attempt by the individual to assimilate information and actions into their pre existing belief system.

We investigated the effect of rapid genetic counselling and testing (RGCT) on treatment decisions and psychosocial well being. Methods Newly diagnosed breast cancer pati ents from 12 Dutch hospitals with at least 10% risk of a BRCA1/2 muta tion were randomized to an intervention group (offer of RGCT) or a usual care control group (ratio 2:1). Study outcomes included uptake of direct bilateral mastectomy (BLM), cancer specific distress, anxiety, depression, and health related quality of life (HRQOL). Assessments took place at study entry, and at 6 and 12 months follow up. Results Between November 2008 and December 2010, we recruited 265 women. Based on intention to treat analyses, no significant group differences were observed in percentage of patients opting for a direct BLM (14.6% (RGCT group) versus 9.2% (control group); OR 2.31; CI 0.92 5.81; p,0.08).

The aim of this study is to evaluate the prevalence of these problems, and to investigate which method for detecting psychosocial problems is most optimal during counseling. Methods: Individuals undergoing genetic coun seling for cancer were invited to complete a questionnaire including the Psychosocial Aspects of Hereditary Cancer (PAHC) questionnaire, the Hos pital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and the Distress Thermometer (DT) prior to, or immediately following, their counseling session. Results: The most frequently reported problems of the 137 participants were on the PAHC domains Ã¢ÂÂliving with cancerÃ¢ÂÂ (84%), Ã¢ÂÂfamily issuesÃ¢ÂÂ (46%), Ã¢ÂÂhereditary predispositionÃ¢ÂÂ(45%), and Ã¢ÂÂchild related issuesÃ¢ÂÂ(42%). Partial correlations between the PAHC, the HADS and DT were low. Previous contact with a psy chosocial worker, and a previous cancer diagnosis were significantly asso ciated with higher distress on the HADS, but explained little variance (9%). No variables were associated with the DT . Previous contact with a psychoso cial worker, and having children were significantly associated with several PAHC domains, but explained a small percentage of the variance (2 14%). Conclusion: The large majority of counselees experience specific problems related to cancer genetic counseling. No variables were identified as impor tant predictors of distress or psychosocial problems.

While both groups expressed that they felt positive about the use of NIPT for pregnancies at known genetic risk, they had concerns about broadening its use in the routine antenatal setting, particularly relating to the early ti ming in pregnancy and the apparent ease of using the technology. Shared concerns included the difficulties of ensuring informed consent, potential misuse of the technology for non medical indications, and a diminished acceptance of disability in society. Patients articulated a strong sense of distinction from the general public, which included their use and perspec tives of the technology, based on their lived experience, prior knowledge of a genetic condition and sense of Ã¢ÂÂgeneticÃ¢ÂÂ responsibility. GCs discussed concerns about availability of necessary knowledge and time to appropria tely offer NIPT in stretched routine services to provide the counselling and support they felt patients required. These findings highlight the importance of discussing and considering the issues surrounding wider implementation of NIPT including differences between those with prior genetic risk and the general population.",2014
22234,"Objective: To study pregnant womenÃ¢ÂÂs current uptake of prenatal screening for Down syndrome, and future interest in non invasive prenatal testing (NIPT).Methods: Online survey on the Dutch pregnancy Fair website, completed by n,389 pregnant women. Results: Uptake of the combined test (33%) corresponded to the average uptake in the Netherlands. Most important reason to have this test was re assurance that the child is healthy (57%). Reasons to decline included: Ã¢ÂÂthe results are just a chanceÃ¢ÂÂ (49%), Ã¢ÂÂfear of miscarriage due to follow up invasi ve diagnosticsÃ¢ÂÂ (34%). 230 (59%) had heard of NIPT; 48% were interested in having NIPT , 24% were unsure, and 28% were uninterested. Safety (33%) and accuracy (30%) were considered most positive aspects, and 70% were willing to pay for it (average 150 euros). 41% expected that women would deliberate less before taking the test, 23% expected more women to feel obliged to take it. Testing for other diseases was considered positive, mostly because this could avoid suffering (75%). However, 38% expected that wo men cannot foresee the consequences of their choices, and acceptance of children with a handicap will reduce (35%). 42% found that women should be able to choose from a list of diseases, 25% preferred packages with diffe rent diseases to choose from, and 30% preferred a fixed list (no choice).Conclusion: The results suggest that more women will have prenatal scree ning if NIPT is to replace the combined test. However, challenges for coun selling are expected if NIPT is introduced, especially when widening the scope of testing. ABSTRACTS EMPAG TALKS ESHG 2014 | MILAN, ITALY | WWW. ESHG.

22235,"Fetal diagnostic testing for chromosomal abnormalities such as Down syn drome (DS) is frequently used in Sweden. Prior to testing expecting parents do not routinely receive information about the conditions being screened for. The aims were to assess why expecting parents choose to undergo CUB testing (combined ultrasound and biochemistry test), their perception of information, thoughts about invasive procedures, possible termination of pregnancy and knowledge about DS. Method: From November 2010 to March 2011, 105 pregnant women and 104 partners answered a questionnaire after completing the CUB test, at the Fetal Medicine Unit, Uppsala University Hospital. Results: The most common reason for choosing a CUB test is Ã¢ÂÂto get a con firmation on a healthy babyÃ¢ÂÂ or Ã¢ÂÂbecause you should do itÃ¢ÂÂ. A majority had not been given information on what it means to live with a child with DS and many requested more information. Internet is the most common source for information about DS. A substantial proportion of pregnant women and partners have little knowledge of the medical, cognitive and social conse quences of DS. Twenty four percent had not yet decided about invasive te sting if increased CUB risk and almost half had not decided what to do about the pregnancy if DS was diagnosed. Conclusions: A majority of expecting parents attending CUB test had not re ceived information about DS and requested more information. A substantial proportion of expecting parents have varying and in several aspects low le vels of knowledge about DS and its consequences. Many had not yet decided what to do if DS was diagnosed.",2014
22236,"Purpose: Much has been written about family provider interactions sur rounding the diagnosis of Down syndrome (DS) and substantial resources have been devoted to helping health care providers feel more prepared to deliver the diagnosis of DS. However reports of parents receiving inaccu rate information continue to appear in the literature. Moreover, anecdotal reports of parents feeling pushed to make unwanted choices, such as under going invasive testing or terminating a pregnancy following the diagnosis of DS, are becoming more common. In addition, limited attention has been devoted to understanding how family experiences vary from one country to another. Therefore, the purpose of this presentation is to compare family ex periences in four countries (Ireland, Portugal, United Kingdom, USA) where differences currently exist in terms of options for prenatal testing and opti ons for families following the diagnosis of DS. Method: 1185 parents of in dividuals with DS completed a survey which includes a variety of questions concerning family provider interactions surrounding the diagnosis. In addi tion, interviews were conducted with a subset of parents. Results: Findings suggest that 50% of the parents were dissatisfied with family provider in teractions and most health care providers are not following the recommen ded guidelines regarding how to inform parents. Additionally, important cultural differences were noted. Conclusion: Findings from this study will help in efforts to improve parental satisfaction with family provider interac tions surrounding the diagnosis of DS. In addition, they will help ensure that cultural context is considered during the informing process.",2014
22237,"Historically, distinct prenatal screening programmes are aimed at finding different types of conditions: 1) maternal/fetal diseases or markers re quiring intervention or adapted care in order to secure healthy pregnan cy outcomes for mother and child; 2) fetal disorders that the prospective parents may regard as a reason for abortion. Ethically, this is an important distinction. There is a widely shared consensus that for screening leading to no other possible interventions but abortion, prevention is a morally pro blematic category. This is why official documents define such screening in terms of what may be called the Ã¢ÂÂautonomy paradigmÃ¢ÂÂ, where the aim is to help individual women/couples make autonomous reproductive choices. This is also reflected in counseling guidelines. Whereas some degree of pro fessional directivity is morally acceptable (or even required) for the first type of prenatal screening, non directivity is regarded as absolutely essen tial for the second. However, this distinction is increasingly under threat. It was already blurred with the introduction of Ã¢ÂÂdual purposeÃ¢ÂÂ ultrasound screening, but it will only be further undermined with the present dynamics of genetic technologies. Think eg. of NIPT for both serious fetal disorders and for gene expression profiles that are predictive of pregnancy compli cations. The expanding scope of prenatal screening will also provide more options for fetal therapy. This presentation will consist of a systematic ex ploration of the ethical challenges involved in this blurring of frameworks and conclude with ethics guidance recommendations for the future field of Ã¢ÂÂprenatal personalized medicineÃ¢ÂÂ (Bianchi).",2014
22238,"This paper reviews the impact of a genetic disorder on family life, reflecting its mode of inheritance, and then examines the social impact of a specific sex linked disorder, hypohidrotic ectodermal dysplasia. The stigmatisation of HED affected males is as important in the accounts given by their women folk as the physical effects of the condition; this impacts on their feelings about transmission of the disorder to the next generation. Perspectives may also change over time, with grandmothers expressing more strongly their sense of guilt at having transmitted the condition, despite there being no question of moral culpability. We then consider the broader impact of stigma on reproductive decisions. They can be impacted by stigma both (i) within families where the practi cal effects of a specific genetic disorder are well known, and (ii) in couples faced by decisions in pregnancy with no prior expectation of a fetus affec ted by a genetic disorder. In the former case, any decision made has impli cations for the self esteem of affected family members. In the latter case, decisions about continuing or terminating the pregnancy may be affected by the parentsÃ¢ÂÂ remembered past and/or imagined future responses to en countering an affected individual. In this way, parentsÃ¢ÂÂ fantasies may shape their decisions. The scope for parental fantasies to influence decisions is greater when technology amplifies the uncertainty attained in genetic investigations or ultrasound imaging. How will parentsÃ¢ÂÂ fantasies of uncertainty play out in practice? What can genetics professionals do to promote respect for affected individuals?",2014
22239,"Introduction: The scope of uncertainty in genomic sequence information has no rival in health care delivery. We present data from adults participating in an NIH genome sequencing cohort study where perceptions of uncertainty are hypothesized to be key in predicting decisions to learn and act on geno mic health information. Methods: We conducted six moderated focus groups with 39 randomly selected ClinSeqÃÂ® participants, varying whether they had coronary heart disease and/or prior receipt of sequence results. We elicited perceptions of the uncertainties associated with genomic sequencing using writing prompts. Results: Participants perceived the uncertainty as a quality of the information. The majority of participants characterized uncertainty of sequencing information as Ã¢ÂÂchanging, fluid, developing, or ground breaking.Ã¢ÂÂ These responses led to anticipation of more optimistic future outcomes. Fewer participants described uncertainty as Ã¢ÂÂquestionable, less accurate, limited, or poorly understoodÃ¢ÂÂ. These perceptions seemed to undermine participantsÃ¢ÂÂ faith in the information, leading to feelings of disillusionment. Discussion: Our findings suggest that perceptions of uncertainty are related to epistemological beliefs and thus expectation of the information. Interven tions to promote realistic expectations of genomic sequencing may mitigate adverse responses to uncertainty. ABSTRACTS EMPAG TALKS ESHG 2014 | MILAN, ITALY | WWW. ESHG.

22240,"These last years, many studies investigate the clinical utility of whole exome sequencing as a diagnostic method. Clinical utility is most commonly esta blished on the basis of data that show the effectiveness or economic value of an innovation. Given that whole exome sequencing is a very new method, however, a multidimensional approach to clinical utility seems more appro priate, which also investigates its acceptability for patients . This paper presents how patients and their families assess the utility of whole exome sequencing, and the diagnosis it produces. Our case study is based on 20 in depth interviews with patients and their families, who are involved as participants in a research project which aims to assess the clini cal utility of whole exome sequencing as a diagnostic tool for children with hitherto unidentified developmental delay. The case study provides insight into why these patients and their families want a diagnosis, and how they value the diagnosis that they eventually get. Their evaluations reveal not just the acceptability of WES as a diagnostic tool, but provide insight into how diagnoses are evaluated with respect to their daily caring practice and social lifeworld. We will argue that this pro vides important input to an assessment of the clinical utility of WES, which may inform how WES is to become part of clinical routine, and how it should be accompanied by counseling.",2014
22241,"Results from genome wide association studies (GWAS) have identified com mon genomic variants that form an important component of the heritability of breast cancer risk. Data from Victorian high risk breast cancer families demonstrate that testing for these genetic factors identifies a significant aetiological group known as Ã¢ÂÂpolygenic familiesÃ¢ÂÂ and provides clinically im portant information. It is important to investigate lay and professional understandings of novel, complex genetic test information generated by SNP testing to identify the most effective ways for genetic health professionals to communicate this in formation to patients and the treating medical team. Our qualitative study aimed to assess patient and healthcare professio nalsÃ¢ÂÂ understandings of genomic variant data. This presentation focus ses upon womenÃ¢ÂÂs expereinces of receiving SNP results following their participation in a GWAS study: Variants In Practice study (VIP). Forty women attended an appointment at the familial cancer clinic, Peter Mac, Australia. Women had 1. previosuly been diagnosed with breast cancer 2. undergone BRCA1/2 mutation testing (no mutation found). Subsequently they were genotyped for 22 common genomic variants from which breast cancer risks were calculated.

22242,"Background: Genomic chromosomal microarray (CMA) testing for childhood investigations has increased diagnostic yields. However, CMAs also increase detection of incidental findings (IFs) and variants of unknown and uncertain clinical significance (VUS). Elucidating patient disclosure preferences may help clinicians anticipate the type of results about which patients want to be informed. Methods: A questionnaire, using hypothetical scenarios, was designed to investigate and compare the perspectives of parents, paediatricians and ge netic health professionals for result disclosure. Quantitative data were ana lysed using ANOVA and Kruskal Wallis tests. Open text data were analysed using content analysis. Results: 147 parents, 159 paediatricians and 69 genetic health professionals participated and at least 89% of respondents in each category certainly or probably favoured disclosure of VUS as well as variants of certain clinical significance, with the lowest percentage being amongst parents, who were less sure of their disclosure preferences. There was consensus among re spondent groups that knowledge of a variant of certain clinical significance would provide more practical and emotional utility compared to VUS. Parents demonstrated some different perspectives to health professionals; for example, they placed more emphasis on using knowledge of a VUS when considering future pregnancies (K. Wallis:p<0.001).Conclusion: This study, together with a previous study investigating the opi nions of a subset of these respondents for disclosure of IFs,(1) is the first Australian exploration of preferences for genomic result disclosure, with implications for clinical practice.(1) Turbitt E, et al.

Within two EU funded projects in oncology (CAGEKID and EUROTARGET), in order to gather researchersÃ¢ÂÂ and health care professionalsÃ¢ÂÂ views and experiences on providing results we distributed a questionnaire to attendees of genetics meetings in Europe in 2013.Of the 95 respondents, 88% work as researchers and/or clinicians in a field related to oncology and half (52%) use NGS in some aspect of their work; 56% of respondents state that they provide specific information about NGS to participants or patients before enrolling them in a study or using their samples for sequencing. The majority, 83% had never received requests from physicians or patients for access to NGS data to inform treatment decisions. Regarding feedback of results in a research setting, 54% or respondents think that results stemming from NGS studies should be provided to individual participants and 72% think that actionable incidental findings should be dis closed to participants. Finally, 53% of respondents think that specific measu res and/or limitations should be implemented for the sharing of NGS data/results with colleagues in the scientific community.

We explore influences on decision making. Methods: The study team used a community based participatory research approach. Parents of children in DBMD CTs were recruited for an online survey through Parent Project Muscular Dystrophy and clinics. Participants viewed a series of be nefit and worry statements and rated each statementÃ¢ÂÂs influence on decisi on making, and how much they expected and hoped/worried about each. Results: From the first 61 participants, CT decision making was influenced by potential altruistic and individual benefits: learning generalizable infor mation (97% slightly to strongly agree), CT resulting in a drug that works (82%), better future for other children (82%), improved quality of life for their child (82%), and parent doing everything to help their child (82%). CT worries most affecting decision making were: child bothered by side ef fects (39%), eligibility for another trial (36%), and child not liking the trial (29%). Expectation and hope ratings were strongly correlated with decisi on making influence ratings (r,0.5 to 0.8, p<0.01). Associations between expectations and altruistic decision making influences yielded the highest correlation values; conversely, associations between hopes and individual benefit influences yielded the highest values. Conclusions: Anticipated CT benefits influenced parentsÃ¢ÂÂ decision making more than worries. The rela tionships among hopes, expectations and decision making influences for al truistic versus individual benefits will be further explored, to inform a new conceptualization of opportunities and challenges during informed consent that extends beyond knowledge oriented concepts such as therapeutic mis conception.",2014

This qualitative study ex plored the impact of participation on 7 children with Morquio A syndrome and parents (5/9 eligible families) and parents of children with Sanfilippo A syndrome (4/6 eligible families). Face to face semi structured interviews were carried out, the interviews were transcribed and key themes identi fied through interpretative phenomenological analysis. The main questions explored were: motivations for taking part, impact on life, and views on the information received prior to the trial. Children described the key role their parents played in providing them with information and supporting them through medical procedures. They talked about what was Ã¢ÂÂgoodÃ¢ÂÂ (e.g. ma king new friends) and Ã¢ÂÂbadÃ¢ÂÂ (e.g. fear of needles) about taking part. Many parents felt there was no real choice as current management options are li mited. Some saw the trial drug as treatment rather than potential treatment. Most felt that too much complex information was given during the consent process, but discussions with the clinical trial team facilitated understan ding and provided emotional and practical support. Parents described ne gative impacts on employment and family life. Positive impacts include an improvement in their childÃ¢ÂÂs condition and a more optimistic outlook for the future. Overall, children and parents felt the advantages outweighed the disadvantages, and would recommend taking part in a similar trial to other children/families.

Semi structured interviews were conducted with genetic counselors and clinical geneticists (n,17), and parents (n,25) of children with one of three genetic conditions (cystic fibrosis, haemophilia and Duchenne muscular dystrophy). Inductive content and thematic analyses were used to compare genetic health professionalsÃ¢ÂÂ and parentsÃ¢ÂÂ accounts of the reasons parents want to know the carrier status of their healthy children. Genetic health professionals expressed views about parentsÃ¢ÂÂ reasons for requesting, including that parents primarily want carrier testing to reduce their own anxiety and be reassured. Several professionals indicated that some parents Ã¢ÂÂjust need to knowÃ¢ÂÂ, and others acknowledged that generally parents request testing with their childÃ¢ÂÂs best interests in mind. In contrast, parents stated they primarily wanted genetic testing in order to convey the information to their children. Parents felt that disclosing carrier status to their children would allow the children to make informed reproductive de cisions or prepare themselves for having an affected child. This mismatch in understanding between the genetic health professionals and parents of the reasons parents want carrier testing in their healthy children has implications for genetic counselling practice.",2014

In many countries, genetic counsellors are employed in specialist genetic centres. However, in Europe, the role and practice of genetic counsellors is at a critical stage of development: in 2014 genetic counsellors will have their first opportunity to formally register via the European Board of Medical Ge netics. The Board states that the genetic counsellor must fulfil a range of roles, including providing information and facilitating psychosocial adjust ment of the client. To examine the extent to which genetic counsellors fulfil the prescribed roles, we conducted a systematic review of the published relevant scientific evidence using the method described by the Centre for Reviews and Dissemination. We searched five relevant electronic databases (Medline, CINAHL, SocIndex, AMED and PsychInfo) using relevant search terms and handsearched four journals for research based papers published in English between 1 January 2000 and 30 June 2013. Of 419 potential pa pers identified initially, only seven satisfied the inclusion criteria for the review and all studies were conducted outside Europe. The findings indica te that where genetic counsellors are utilised in specialist genetic settings, they undertake a significant workload associated with direct patient care and this appears to be acceptable to patients. Genetic counsellors manage cases related to a wide range of conditions, predominantly where the dia gnosis has been clearly established. With the increasing burden on genetic counselling services, there is an argument for the increased use of genetic counsellors in countries where they are under utilised. However, further re search on the roles of genetic counsellors in Europe is required.",2014

This qualitative study aimed to identify elements of culturally competent genetic health service provision for this population group. Twelve semi structured interviews were conducted with genetic counsellors and clinical geneticists from around Australia who had experience delivering services to Indige nous Australians.

Interviews were audio recorded and transcribed with thematic analysis conducted on the data. The findings show that participants were reluctant to generalise the needs of Indigenous peoples. Some participants asserted that Indigenous peoples have needs that differ from the general populati on, while others felt that there were no collective cultural needs, instead advocating an individualized approach. However, being flexible and practi cal, taking time to build rapport, recognising different family structures and decision making processes, as well as other socio economic factors were all identified as important factors in participantsÃ¢ÂÂ interactions with Indigenous patients.

The silence that occurs about the IGC can be detrimental to the long term mental health and well being of parents and children. Methods: To fa cilitate better family communication about the IGC, we designed a therapeu tic intervention based on multi family discussion groups (MFDG) used in systemic family therapy. To inform the interventionÃ¢ÂÂs development, a series of focus groups for parents, children, young people and genetic counsellors were held. Findings: MFDG were considered important for facilitating fami ly communication. Families suggested MFDG should be held in welcoming environments that simultaneously facilitate involvement in group activities but also provide distraction from the emotionally challenging subject mat ter. MFDGs should be attended by families with similar IGC but not neces sarily the same so that they could relate to and learn from each othersÃ¢ÂÂ ex periences.

22255,"In the near future, testing of single or few genes is expected to be replaced by whole exome/genome sequencing (WE/GS). which raises controversies on communication and management of incidental findings. However, few stu dies have analyzed the perspectives of those expected to be more affected by WE/GS: patients undergoing genetic testing (GT). A semi structured in terview was submitted to patients undergoing clinical GT with the aim of exploring their attitudes toward communication of genetic alterations other than those specifically searched for. Eighty two patients, 22.8% females and 77.2% males, aged 18 83 years, were interviewed between June 2013 and mid february 2014. Only a minority (36.6%) stated they had heard of WE/ GS before. The majority of interviewed (58; 70.7%) stated they would like to be informed of any alteration; this answer was not influenced by previous knowledge, marital status, gender, education, and purpose of testing, while showed a significant correlation with having children: outof 48 with no children, 22 (75%) desired to know any alteration compared to 22 out of 32 (68%) having children (p,0.04). Although less aware (only 18% reported knowledge of WE/GS), younger people (18 35 years) were more likely to want to know any alteration (86% versus 70% and 60% in people aged 36 54 and 55 83, respectively). The main reason for choosing to be informed of any alterations was the willing to have a clear knowledge of own risks (89.7%), while helplessness and fear of an unpreventable disease were the main motivations for those willing to be informed only of preventable di seases.",2014
22256,"BackgroundThe ability to analyse the genetic code in ever greater detail means that the possibility of clinically relevant findings, that are unrelated to the original reason for a test, is increased.

22257,"Background: A large proportion of clinical geneticistsÃ¢ÂÂ workload includes investigations for children with developmental delay where the under lying cause often remains unknown. New diagnostic technologies provide hope for a diagnosis for many of these children. However, results generated through use of these technologies increases the complexity of communica tion and uncertainty during genetic consultations. To date there has been limited research into the process of paediatric genetic consultations. This project investigates the process and experiences for clinicians and parents during these consultations. Methods: This qualitative project investigated consultations across four Au stralian states. Theoretical framework: Symbolic Interactionism meaning is derived, created and modified through social interactions. Data: audio recorded consultations (n,32), parent pre consultation surveys (n,32), and post consultation interviews with parents (n,32) and clinicians (n,11).

Results: Overall, the content of the consultations was similar although clini cians appeared to have different Ã¢ÂÂstylesÃ¢ÂÂ of communicating and interacting with families. Parents largely understood the information and had reali stic expectations regarding diagnoses. Where expectations were not met, parents were often disappointed. Clinicians described many professional challenges working in this area, both practical and emotional, especially the frustration of frequently being unable to answer parentsÃ¢ÂÂ questions regar ding the cause of the childÃ¢ÂÂs delay.

22258,"Background: Doctors need to investigate if there is an indication for DNA testing and provide their patients with information. We aimed to gain in sight in discussion of cancer genetic topics by gastroenterologists and sur geons as part of an intervention study, comprising a checklist for doctors, intending to optimize referral to genetic counselling of patients visiting the Gastro Intestinal Oncology Centre Amsterdam. Insight into physiciansÃ¢ÂÂ per formance can improve referral and optimize patient understanding. Methods: Following a pre post design, both before and after introduction of the checklist, 40 consecutive, new patients completed a short questionnaire assessing the discussion of cancer genetic topics during the initial consul tation. Additionally, after introduction of the checklist, initial consultations were audiotaped for a qualitative analysis of the discussion of cancer genetic topics. Data on family history and referral was collected from medical files. Findings: Discussion of cancer in the family increased from 78% before, to 90% post intervention (p,0.11). However, doctors infrequently asked about second degree family members (pre: 50%; post: 65%; p,0.19) and age at which family members got cancer (pre: 57%; post: 70%; p,0.29). Qualita tive analysis of the audiotapes indicated the use of multi interpretable and vague questions. Discussion: Contrary to expectations, cancer in patientsÃ¢ÂÂ family members was discussed in most intake consultations. However, the suboptimal quali ty of the discussion hampers optimal referral for genetic counselling. Deve lopment of an alternative intervention might help better discussion of can cer genetic topics. Education for doctors is needed to improve knowledge and discussion of cancer genetic topics.",2014
22259,"Background: Should healthcare professionals (HCPs) have a responsibility to ensure patientsÃ¢ÂÂ relatives are aware of genetic risk? What kind of consent is required before genetic information is shared? And how might sharing information affect patient confidentiality? The UK has national guidelines regarding these matters. We explored HCPsÃ¢ÂÂ and patientsÃ¢ÂÂ views. Method: We conducted 13 HCP focus groups (n,60) and 31 patient inter views in the UK. Data were analysed thematically. Findings: HCPs and patients felt genetic information should ideally be confi dential to families, not individuals. Keeping individual confidentiality could constrain relativesÃ¢ÂÂ comprehension of risk and ability to make informed de cisions about testing. But familial confidentiality and sharing information was difficult for HCPs to put into practice, due to limited time and practical resources and concerns about disrupting family dynamics. Sharing informa tion across genetic services was also problematic, because of variations in how consent was documented and what it entailed, e.g. some genetic ser vices gave patients an explicit choice of whether HCPs could share informa tion with relatives, while others used an opt out system where permission to share was assumed. Few patients remembered consenting and the opti ons given. Conclusion: Sharing information and familial confidentiality were viewed positively by most participants, but not consistently put into practice by HCPs. We therefore show that guidelines are not yet fully integrated into cli nic. These issues will become more pertinent as increasing amounts of data about patientsÃ¢ÂÂ relatives are produced though genome wide testing.

22260,"Informed consent is the ethical and legal bedrock of clinical practice and research involving humans. This paper investigates consent in practice by exploring how professionals account for consent to microsatellite instability and immunohistochemical testing for features of Lynch Syndrome and bio banking for research purposes. Twenty eight semi structured interviews were undertaken with professio nals responsible for seeking consent. Thematic mapping was carried out on transcribed data, which led to the identification of themes for more detailed analysis. Data were examined from a rhetorical discourse analysis perspec tive, which involved micro examination of the discursive devices drawn on by participants in their talk. Two themes encompass the communicative difficulties that were described: Autonomy (enabling choice) and handling emotional responses in inter action. Challenges pertaining to enabling choice involve different forms of opposition to respecting the autonomy of the person giving consent, both within and beyond the individuals involved in communication. Issues con cerning handling emotional responses in interaction involve accounts of strong emotions both of those asked to consent and also of the professionals involved. These two themes were unevenly balanced between the settings with challenges of handling emotional responses almost entirely confined to bio bank settings. This is likely to reflect the contexts of current and previous family experiences. In both settings, enabling autonomy becomes complex when the professional is not involved in a face to face interaction with the person asked to give consent. This work brings an alternative perspective to accomplishing consent, as an interactive process involving complex moral negotiations within relationships.",2014
22261,"Objective: To assess the effectiveness of a telephone based peer delivered intervention, in reducing distress among female BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation carriers. The intervention consisted of trained peer volunteers contacting women multiple times over a four month period to provide informational, emotional and practical support. Methods: 337 participants completed the baseline questionnaire and those reporting interest in talking to other mutation carriers were randomized to either usual care group (UCG) (n , 102) or intervention group (IG) (n , 105). Two follow up questionnaires were completed: i) four months after rando mization (Time 2, intervention end for IG) and ii) two months later (Time 3). Outcomes included breast cancer anxiety (primary outcome), unmet infor mation needs, and cognitive appraisals about mutation testing. Results: Over the study period, there was a greater decrease in breast can cer anxiety in the IG than UCG (p<0.01) and at Time 2, the IGÃ¢ÂÂs mean breast cancer anxiety scores were significantly lower than the UCGÃ¢ÂÂs. There was a greater reduction in unmet information needs in the IG than UCG (p<0.01), with unmet needs lower in the IG than UCG at Time 2 (p<0.01). There was a greater reduction in cognitive appraisals stress in the IG than UCG (p<.01) with significantly lower scores found at Time 2 for the IG compared to UCG (p<.01). However cross sectional differences were not found at Time 3 for any outcome measure. Conclusion: The intervention is effective in reducing breast cancer related anxiety and unmet information needs in the short term. Identifying strate gies for prolonging intervention effects is warranted.",2014

Introduction In Victoria, Australia, following prenatal diagnosis of a fetal abnormality, women and their partners are commonly offered a choice about whether to have an abortion or continue their pregnancy. Objectives The PeTALS project aims to explore the psychosocial impact of prenatal diagnosis and identify professional and social supports utilised and needed at this time. Methods This study is being conducted at 3 sites including two tertiary me tropolitan hospitals and a private ultrasound clinic. A longitudinal case stu dy approach is being used to collect questionnaire and qualitative data from women at three different time points Ã¢ÂÂ 6 weeks post definitive diagnosis of fetal abnormality, 6 9 months later, and 2 years post diagnosis. Findings 39 women were interviewed at the first time point, regarding their experience of receiving a prenatal diagnosis (27 had various chromo somal aneuploidies, 6 had cardiac anomalies, 6 had other structural anoma lies), and choosing to have an abortion (n,33), or continue their pregnancy (n,6) . Women commonly experienced significant grief and overwhelming sadness; many described intense feelings of isolation from their partner, fa mily and friends. Women who had an abortion described feeling negatively Ã¢ÂÂjudgedÃ¢ÂÂ and reported that their partners also experienced significant emo tional impact. Conclusions Women describe variable and sometimes inadequate levels of follow up bereavement care and support. There is a need for increased support and counselling for couples following prenatal diagnosis. Providing prenatal testing and abortion in the absence of a full range of supportive options may be considered unethical; this is an important area for ongoing research.",2014

There is an increasing demand for prenatal or pre implantation diagnosis by couples in which one partner is a HD carrier and who want to avoid transmission of the disorder to their children. This exploratory qualitative study aims to gain insight into the decision making process regarding reproductive options by young HD car riers and their partners, and into the way prenatal testing is being experi enced. Materials and methods: Using thematic analysis, ten semi structured interviews were conducted in HD carriers aged between 18 and 30 years, to document their attitude on and experience with the decision making pro cess that preceded their request of a prenatal or pre implantation genetic diagnosis. Following topics were addressed: 1/ Which issues arose in the decision to have children?; 2/ Which issues arose in the decision to have prenatal testing (PD or PGD); 3/ How did you experience the actual proce dure ?; 4/ How do you see the future with your children? Results: For young HD carriers not to choose for prenatal testing is not an option, nor is refrai ning from offspring. With regard to the emotional impact, major differences in the lived experience of PD and PGD are reported: the prospect of a termi nation of pregnancy causes great distress in women. Conclusions: With this exploratory study we gain understanding in the complex psychological pro cess linked to procreative decision making of young HD carriers and their partners that opt for a prenatal or pre implantation diagnosis.",2014
22264,"The practice of fetal anomaly detection has progressed tremendously from the first diagnoses of anencephaly by x ray to modern 4 D imaging techni ques and chromosomal microarrays. Although these new technologies will increase the range of abnormalities that can be detected prenatally, the amount of uncertain findings will also increase. The current practice of fetal anomaly detection has largely developed as the result of rapid transfer of research developments to practice with limited prior ethical reflection. To date, although Ã¢ÂÂuncertaintyÃ¢ÂÂ is often cited as a potential drawback to more detailed genetic testing in the prenatal setting, there has been little study of the impact of uncertainty on the decision making process of patients. In order to gain insight into these processes and to better understand how to approach the ethical evaluation of new fetal anomaly detection technolo gies, a qualitative study was undertaken. In depth interviews of 26 partici pants who had received an uncertain prognosis in their pregnancies were conducted. These interviews identified a number of key themes including managing information, values and decisional context, and trust. The fin dings raised a number of questions, regarding for example the usefulness of the notion of autonomy as a primary ethical principle in the prenatal context where parents must make decisions based on unclear and often changing information. These findings have implications for how new fetal anomaly detection technologies are evaluated and put into practice to ensure that the maximum benefit is achieved with the minimum harm.",2014
22265,"Background: We implemented whole genome SNP array instead of conven tional karyotyping (CK) for prenatal diagnosis (PND). Array detects more clinically relevant anomalies and more genetic anomalies of yet unquan tified risk for neurodevelopmental disorders, so called susceptibility loci (SL). Using SNP array ensues the question whether pregnant couples want to know more and oversee the possible consequences. We explored whether pregnant couples at increased risk for aneuploidies were capable of infor med decision making when offered a choice between the clinical outcomes of a SNP array analyzed at 5 Mb resolution (comparable to CK) and a SNP ar ray analyzed at 0.5 Mb resolution with or without SL. Methods: Consenting pregnant couples (N,143) received genetic counseling by phone and filled out the Measure of Informed choice (MIC) designed for this study. Choices based on sufficient knowledge and congruent with attitude were considered informed. Results : The MIC had sufficient internal consistency (Knowledge ÃÂ±,.74; Attitude ÃÂ±,.80). Median MIC knowledge score was 5, range 0 7. We considered a score Ã¢ÂÂ¥5 on the MIC knowledge scale as sufficient. Based on this criterion, 66% of the couples had sufficient knowledge and thus made an informed decision. However, 82% found it difficult to reproduce know ledge about SL. Discussion: Our results show that the majority of couples were capable of making an informed choice. However, the most complicated possible outcome of array, SL, was least understood. More research is neces sary to assess what the psychological impact of SL is when couples have not well anticipated this possible outcome.",2014
22266,"Background: Genomic SNP array as a first tier prenatal cytogenetic test for all indications has been implemented in our laboratory. Array may also detect susceptibility loci (SL) for neurodevelopmental disorders, with an unquantifiable risk for the fetus. SL may psychologically challenge the coup le in their decision whether or not to continue their pregnancy. Since we implemented SNP array in September 2010, our policy was to disclose the presence of SL. We conducted this study to explore the psychological im pact of receiving a SL. Methods In our pretest counseling was no emphasis on the possibility of receiving a SL. Twelve pregnant couples whose fetus was affected with a SL were asked for participation postnatally. Two couples and six men refused participation. Consenting participants (N,13, four men and nine women) were interviewed by phone. The interview was structu red with a fixed set of questions. Results Receiving their SL was shocking to 10 out of 13 participants. Postnatally, all participants considered their child healthy without concern about the SL. They stressed the importance of a pre and posttest counseling and their wish for a choice regarding SL disclosure. Eleven participants indicated they wished to learn about their SL again. Conclusions Although our group is small, it is one of the first studies providing a preliminary insight into how couples experienced receiving a prenatal SL. Further studies have to be carried out in order to investigate the (dis)advantages of reporting SL in a prenatal setting, from medical as well as from psychological point of view.

22267,"Background: Array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) in pregnan cy allows a higher detection rate and shorter turnaround time compared to karyotyping. However, the test can also reveal findings that are (a) not related to the reason for which the test was done (b) relevant only much later in life, and (c) uncertain. Little empirical data exist on health care pro fessionalsÃ¢ÂÂ (HCPsÃ¢ÂÂ) views about these issues. Aims: To explore the views of UK HCPs about: the type of information that should be sought and disclosed; timing of disclosure (i.e. during pregnancy/after birth/when the information is medically actionable); and who should decide about these issues. Methods: Q methodology, which combines qualitative and quantitative ap proaches, was used to explore the views of 45 HCPs (Genetic health profes sionals, lab scientists, fetal medicine experts).Results: Preliminary data suggest that: HCPs either prioritise parental choices, or their own judgements about clinical relevance to determine dis closure. Most HCPs support aCGH testing in pregnancies for further investigations of abnormalities found on scans, but would not currently wish to offer it otherwise. Where aCGH uncovers adult onset predispositions, many argue that the se should be disclosed because (a) they might be relevant to one or other parent, and (b) they are not confident that systems can be set up to delay disclosure to nearer the time of clinical relevance. Conclusion: HCPs support the introduction of prenatal aCGH into clinical practice in certain circumstances, but are concerned that consent procedu res, education of professionals outside of genetics and national guidelines are not yet in place to address all the ethical issues.",2014

This long term perspective has provided some valuable insights into dealing with the challenges of the process and impact of predictive testing. This paper pre sents our recommended procedures, based on lessons learned, for various aspects of the process including pre result assessments, timing of test cli niciansÃ¢ÂÂ knowledge of result, testing of minors, testing of siblings, protocol flexibility and the therapeutic relationship versus duty of care, and follow up.

Predic tive testing by direct mutation analysis for individuals at risk of HD has been available since 1993. Internationally agreed guidelines for predictive testing have been published and recently updated but variability exists in how te sting is delivered between centres. Whilst a substantive literature exists on the impact of predictive testing, few studies have looked at how the predicti ve test counselling process is received by tested individuals. This evaluation study sought the views of individuals who had a predictive test for HD at our centre over a 5 year period (2007 2012). 44 of 100 eligible individuals completed and returned a questionnaire designed for the purpose of the study. Descriptive statistics were used to present the quantitative data and a thematic analysis was conduced on the free text comments.

22271,"Background: This qualitative study focuses on experiences of a sample of young female BRCA carriers who had predictive genetic testing before the age of 30 and explores their motivations for testing and implications of re ceiving a positive (bad news) result. Methods: Following appropriate informed consent procedures participants were recruited through the Cancer Genetics Service for Wales. Semi structu red interviews were conducted face to face with seven participants. Inter views were transcribed in full and analysed using thematic analysis. Results: The motives for testing and perceived advantages described by participants were similar to those identified in previous studies with older participants, such as increased awareness and knowledge, and feeling more in control. However some of the perceived disadvantages described by par ticipants were specific to young women. These included feeling pressured to make important life decisions earlier than they would have liked, for examp le decisions about when/if to have children, and about risk reducing sur gery. Participants also reported feeling abandoned or forgotten because of the loss of ongoing clinical contact or feeling Ã¢ÂÂstuck waitingÃ¢ÂÂ for screening to begin. None of the participants however, felt that these disadvantages were sufficient reason to regret having had the test at a young age. Conclusions: Findings in this small study suggest that having BRCA pre dictive testing can have positive outcomes for young women. However they should be encouraged during pre test counselling to explore the decisions and choices they may be faced with in the event of a bad news test results and may benefit from ongoing support/follow up.

In addition, the participants expectations and experience with participating at the LCS were discussed. They were also encouraged to expound upon any other issues important to them. The data were analyzed using content analysis as described by Knodel. Preliminary results indicate that the participants had experienced random and different information regarding risk reducing surgery.

Other themes as feelings of loneliness and fear of cancer development were also identified in this study.",2014
22273,"Purpose: About half of people from mutation carrying families do not undergo genetic counselling and/or testing to identify their mutation status and risk of colorectal cancer (CRC). We studied perceived CRC risk and qua litative analysis of reasons for declining in this group. Patients and MethodsWe studied 26 participants (mean age 43.1 years, 14 women) in the Australa sian Colorectal Cancer Family Registry who were relatives of mismatch re pair gene mutation carriers; who had not been diagnosed with any cancer at the time of recruitment and who had declined an invitation to attend genetic counselling and/or testing at the time of interview. Bounded estimates of perceived CRC risk over the next 10 years, understanding of genetic testing and CRC risk, reasons for declining testing and self reported colonoscopy screening were elicited during a face to face semi structured interview. Results: A sub group of decliners (31%) unconditionally rejected genetic te sting compared to conditional decliners who would consider genetic testing in the future. Mean perceived 10 year risk of CRC was 54% [95% CI 37, 71] in unconditional decliners, compared with the mean perceived 10 year risk of CRC of 20% [95% CI 5,36] in people who conditionally decline genetic testing. This difference remained after adjusting for potential confounding factors (age, gender and reported screening colonoscopy).Conclusions: The unconditional decliner group perceive themselves to be at 3.26 times higher risk than conditional decliners. Novel interventions in general practice clinics may improve genetic testing uptake and/or appro priate colonoscopy screening for this high risk and under serviced group.

Graetz; Mercy Hospital for Women, Melbourne, Australia. Microarrays have replaced conventional karyotyping for the detection of chromosomal imbalance for the large majority of cases in the prenatal set ting. Our clinic began to offer microarray in 2010. The test was initially re stricted to women found to carry a fetus with a structural abnormality on ul trasound, in accordance with studies that suggested an increase in detection rate of a chromosomal imbalance not detected by karyotype. More recent studies have examined offering microarray to all women undergoing invasi ve procedures for reasons such as advanced maternal age, increased risk on screening and parental anxiety. In our clinic, a large proportion of our clients are referred for increased risk counselling post screening. Within this group, many women undergoing invasive testing to exclude chromosome abnor malities have opted to have microarray with the view of greater detection of syndromes that have a significant clinical impact. Our counselling includes the risk of detecting a CNV of unknown or uncertain significance.

Feldman3; 1Department of Nursing, University of Haifa, Haifa, Israel, 2The Susanne Levy Gertner Oncogenetics Unit, Sheba Medical Center, Tel Aviv, Israel, 3The Danek Gertner Institute of Human Genetics, Sheba Medical Center, Tel Aviv, Israel. Aim: In 2006, the Israeli Ministry of Health issued directives to expand PGD to encompass hereditary breast cancer syndrome. This study aimed to de cipher the factors affecting PGD decisions among Israeli BRCA1/2 mutation carriers or a spouse of a carrier. Methods: We used a qualitative phenomenological approach. Participants were 19 Jewish Israeli women, who requested PGD for BRCA1/2 mutation detection for their future embryos, at the Sheba Medical Center. All women were either carriers (n,14) or spouses of a male carrier (n,5), of one of the three Ashkenazi founder mutations in BRCA1/2. Of carriers, six were diagnosed with breast cancer. All women are married, and all but three had at least one child. We invited the women to narrate what motivated their choice to opt for PGD. Thematic analysis was used to unveil experiences and preferences related to the issue. Results: Three significant factors were found to be associated with PGD: Pri or infertility treatment (n,12); The existence of frozen embryos after ferti lity preservation treatment, done before chemotherapy (n,5); and Family history of ovarian and/or early onset breast cancer (n,10). Although most women underwent PGD (n,16), the majority (n,12) ended by declining the selection process, primarily for clinical, bureaucratic and financial difficul ties. Discussion: This study details factors associated with the choice to undergo PGD, in order to prevent the passing on of the `bad` BRCA1/2 mutation. Alt hough, PGD for BRCA1/2 mutation is allowed in Israel, it is not funded by the Israeli healthcare insurance. This study was funded by the Israel Cancer Association grant. EP03 S Prenatal genetics service: the service usersÃ¢ÂÂ perspective C. Eddy, T . Homfray, S. Mansour, V. Tripathi; South West Thames Regional Genetics Service, St. Georges Hospital NHS Trust, London, United Kingdom. Prenatal Genetics is about to become yet more complex with the advent of array comparative genome hybridisation with some centers already having implemented this approach. Various research studies looking into the pro cess of the prenatal genetic diagnosis interaction highlight that cliniciansÃ¢ÂÂ and service usersÃ¢ÂÂ can have different goals, purposes and values regarding prenatal testing. Informed patient decision making requires that informa tion provision is responsive to patient interests. Clinical audit is one me thod to elucidate the needs of these service users. An advocate in the UK for this approach of information provision, support and care that is responsive to the current needs of service users is the national charity Antenatal Re sults and Choices (ARC), which provides non directive support to expectant and bereaved parents throughout and after the antenatal testing process. ARC provides guidance on the principles of good practice when supporting parents through a diagnosis of fetal abnormality. The South West Thames Regional Genetics service is responsible for a population of 2.2 million peop le and undertakes approximately 400 prenatal appointments annually. To assess the ongoing needs of our prenatal service users, a clinical audit was conducted through the use of a questionnaire which was sent to 150 fami lies. The responses were then corroborated with data from the clinical gene tic notes. The collated results were annonymised for the purpose of analysis. This retrospective clinical audit will present areas of good practice already in existence and others which may provide opportunities to improve patient experience with the advent of emerging new genetic technologies. EP04 M An easy test but a hard decision: non invasive prenatal testing and emerging ethical issues L. Goldsmith, H. Skirton, L. Jackson, A. OÃ¢ÂÂConnor; Plymouth University, Plymouth, United Kingdom. Non invasive prenatal testing (NIPT) using cell free fetal DNA in maternal serum can be used to test for specific genetic disorders. The aim of this stu dy, part of the RAPID project, was to explore ethical issues around NIPT for single gene disorders. We used a qualitative cross sectional design and re cruited carriers of four autosomal recessive conditions: cystic fibrosis, tha lassaemia, spinal muscular atrophy and sickle cell disease. Data were collec ted via focus groups or telephone interview and analysed thematically. Parents were overwhelmingly in favour of NIPT: those with deceased child ren were especially keen to reduce the chance of fetal loss, while many valued knowledge of fetal status in the first trimester. Obtaining written consent was considered important to emphasise the potential impact of the results on the pregnancy and to avoid possible routinisation of the test, as parents reflected that although the test was easy, subsequent decisions could be hard. Parents felt that giving the mother time to discuss the test with her partner was required before blood was taken. Where fathers decli ned carrier testing, participants felt that mothers should be able to request a test, but the father should be aware the result might convey potentially un wanted information about his carrier status if the fetus was affected. While many of the ethical issues echo those for invasive testing, due to the ease of non invasive testing, it is important that it does not become routine and that informed decision making by parents is supported by professionals. EP05 S The phenotype and genotype of Bartter syndrome in Maltese patients V. Said Conti1, V. Benoit2, S. Attard Montalto1, R. Parascandalo1, J. Torpiano1, P . Hilbert2, I. Borg3; 1Department of Paediatrics, Mater Dei Hospital, Msida, Malta, 2DÃÂ©partement de Biologie MolÃÂ©culaire,Institut de Pathologie et de GÃÂ©nÃÂ©tique, Gosselies, Belgium, 3Department of Medical Genetics, Mater Dei Hospital, Msida, Malta. We describe the clinical phenotype and genotype in a Maltese cohort with BartterÃ¢ÂÂs syndrome. Children with a genetic diagnosis of BartterÃ¢ÂÂs syndrome until December 2013 were included. Gender, gestation, birth weight, occipitofrontal circum ference (OFC), age at presentation,age and clinical phenotype at diagnosis, were documented. Three female and one male were identified with age range of 2 15 years. All pregnancies were complicated by polyhydramnios and prematurity. Median gestational age was 33 weeks. Birth weight ranged from 1.5kgs 2.1kgs. All OFC measurements were above P90. Two children were diagnosed clinically at birth, one child at 2 years and one at 6ÃÂ½ years. One child has severe spa stic diplegia from complications of prematurity and one child has delayed speech. All have a small triangular face, small chin and body weight along a low percentile. Two children have been diagnosed with nephrogenic Dia betes Insipidus. All have borderline low normal potassium levels, normal eGFR and parathyroid hormone, and bilateral nephrocalcinosis. Molecular genetic analysis in the coding region of the KCNJ1 gene revealed a homo zygous c.277T>G mutation in all patients; all parents are heterozygous for the same variation. A random sample of 100 Maltese and a 100 Belgian DNA samples, revealed the heterozygous state in 1 Maltese sample and none in the Belgian samples. To our knowledge the c.277T>G mutation is reported once, in a compound heterozygote Italian patient. It would appear that the c.277T>G variation is a Maltese mutation since it presents in the homozygous state in all patients. Some phenotypic features are shared by all patients. EP06 M Attitudes of pregnant women and male partners towards non invasive prenatal testing (NIPT) and widening the scope of prenatal screening R. V. van Schendel1, J. H. Kleinveld1, W. J. Dondorp2, E. Pajkrt3, D. R. M. Timmermans1, K. C. A. Holtkamp1, A. M. A. Lachmeijer1, L. Henneman1; 1VU University Medical Center, Amsterdam, Netherlands, 2Maastricht University, Maastricht, Netherlands, 3Academic Medical Center, Amsterdam, Netherlands. ABSTRACTS EMPAG POSTERS ESHG 2014 | MILAN, ITALY | WWW. ESHG. ORG 361Back to inde x Non invasive prenatal testing (NIPT) and its potential to test for multiple disorders has received much attention. This study explores womenÃ¢ÂÂs and menÃ¢ÂÂs attitudes towards NIPT , and their views on widening the scope of prenatal testing in a country with a low uptake of prenatal screening (the Netherlands). Five focus groups with low risk pregnant women (n,28), three focus groups with men (n,19) and 13 interviews with high and low risk pregnant women were conducted. Participants felt that current prena tal screening has great disadvantages such as uncertain results and risk of miscarriage from follow up diagnostics. Characteristics of NIPT (accurate, safe and early testing) could therefore diminish these disadvantages of pre natal screening and help lower the barrier for participation. This suggests that NIPT might allow couples to decide about prenatal testing based most ly on their will to test or not, rather than largely based on fear of miscar riage risk or the uncertainty of results. The lower barrier for participation was also seen as a downside that could lead to uncritical use or pressure to test. Widening the scope of prenatal testing was seen as beneficial for severe disorders, although it was perceived difficult to determine where to draw the line. Participants argued that there should be a limit to the scope of NIPT , avoiding testing for minor abnormalities. The findings suggest that NIPT could enable more conscious decision making for prenatal screening. However, to ensure voluntary participation, especially when testing for mul tiple disorders, safeguards on the basis of informed decision making will be of utmost importance. EP07 S Case Ilustrations of the utilization and uptake of NIPT counselling and management issues J. Kelley; Mercy Hospital for Women, Melbourne, Australia. Non invasive prenatal testing (NIPT) for aneuploidy using cell free DNA in maternal circulation has had a dramatic impact on prenatal screening and diagnosis. In Melbourne, Australia, NIPT is offered by several different ser vice providers with out of pocket costs ranging from $500 $1,200. Testing is largely performed in the USA and turn around times vary from 10 days to 3 weeks. Some centres provide clients with genetic counselling. At present, clients attending our public hospital may access NIPT as a first tier screening option or after first or second trimester screening. We have observed that many women who receive an increased risk result for Trisomy 21 will utilize NIPT before committing to an invasive test such as amniocentesis. Personal experiences that appear to influence this decision include IVF pregnancies, history of infertility, advanced maternal age, religious/spiritual beliefs and a desire to further clarify their risk. Counselling for this group of women requires significant time to explore the various pathways and possible out comes, and the limitations and benefits of each. Case examples will be used to illustrate our experiences with clients taking up NIPT , including management of false positive results, inappropriate use of NIPT and failure to achieve results. Decision making processes and coun selling issues arising from NIPT will be explored. EP08 M Monitoring of congenital anomalies in the population of the Republic of Moldova V . V . Egorov, N. I. Barbova, E. A. Halabudenco, M. S. Stratila; National Center of Human Reproduction and Medical Genetics, Chisinau, Moldova, Republic of. In the Republic of Moldova, the monitoring of the CA using since 1991, and from 2009 we are working to incorporate our registry in the EUROCAT . Were studied the prevalence and sharing of CA on the basis of genetic mo nitoring for the period from 2008 to 2012. The overall prevalence of the CA for the 5 year period amounted to 18.92 per 1000 newborns. The maximum frequency of the CA was noted in 2008 20.3 per 1000 births, the lowest in 2009 18.36 to 1000 newborns. Prenatal screening of pregnant women using non invasive and invasive diagnostic techniques has allowed to reduce the average frequency of the birth of children with CA for 7.2% to 17.56 per 1000 newborns. In the structure of the CA by prevalence leading place is occupied by CA of the musculoskeletal system (22.5 ÃÂ± 2.58%), multiple mal formations (22.02 ÃÂ± 2.98%) and the CA of the circulatory system (19.12 ÃÂ± 4.48%). The prevalence of individual nosological forms of CA (esophageal atresia, cleft lip/palate, omphalocele, Down syndrome) are consistent with those of the international register of EUROCAT . Results of questionnaire of 158 women given birth to children with CA showed that 85.6% of women do not take folic acid in the first trimester of pregnancy. 74.5% of the mothers drank alcohol during pregnancy. Influence of the teratogenic factors noted at 22.2% of cases. Monitoring data allow to plan and carry out preventive measures to reduce the birth rate of the children with CA in Moldova. EP09 SThe impact of the perceived severity of genetic conditions on the attitudes towards genetic testing and termination of pregnancy A. M. CiucÃÂ , R. Moldovan; BabeÃÂ Bolyai University, Cluj Napoca, Romania. Introduction: It is known that different factors (e.g. education, religion, severity of genetic conditions) may influence decisions regarding genetic testing and/or termination of pregnancy. Objective: The aim of the present study was to investigate the extent to which the perceived severity of various conditions moderates the decision to opt for genetic testing and/or termination of pregnancy. Methods: The study was conducted on adult couples from the general po pulation in Romania. Participants were asked to complete questionnaires assessing the perceived severity of 30 conditions, the attitudes towards ge netic testing and the attitudes towards termination of pregnancy. Results of the study are being analyzed and presented in detail. Discussion & Conclusions: This study was aimed at integrating these three concepts in order to have a better understanding of the factors associated with the decision to opt for genetic testing or terminate a pregnancy, in the general population. Implications of the impact of perceived severity of gene tic conditions on the decision to opt for genetic testing and termination of pregnancy are being discussed. EP10 M Development of Myriad Individualized Medicine Units N. Bosch, E. Iglesias, C. Peel, C. Perez, N. Angulo, C. Moretones, C. Zapatero, E. AlbiÃÂ±ana, F. Iglesias; Myriad Genetics, Madrid, Spain. Since its foundation 20 years ago, Myriad genetics has become a leading molecular diagnostic company dedicated to making a difference in patientÃ¢ÂÂs lives. Through the discovery and commercialization of transformative tests to asses a personÃ¢ÂÂs risk of developing disease, guide treatment decisions and assess risk of disease progression and recurrence. These test services achieve top quality assessment enabling top quality information for the pa tient based on test results. Myriad laboratory operates under the highest standards of lean efficiency allowing result reporting much faster than ave rage. In its aim to improve patientÃ¢ÂÂs quality of live and deliver top quality information to the patients, Myriad Spain has developed a plan to create Individualized Medicine Units (IMUs). These multidisciplinary units located into the health system offer professional cancer counseling services. Diffe rent professionals including nurses, geneticists, genetic counselors, onco logists and psychologists will provide genetic testing education to patients and medical specialists. Thus, IMUs will become single organization struc tures which will permit a degree of coherence in providing genetic tests to counseled individuals. With the creation of IMUs access to an integral ser vice with added value will benefit individuals affected of cancer as well as individuals at risk to develop it. IMUs are patient centered structures which intend to implement equal opportunity, help specialists to interpret genetic test results as well as to get genetic guided medical and preventive options closer to patients. EP11 S The disclosure of direct to consumer genetic testing: how to regulate them? S. Oliveri1,2, A. Gorini1,2, C. Lucchiari1,2, M. G. Hansson3, G. Pravettoni1,2; 1Interdisciplinary Research Center on Decision Making Processes IRIDe, Department of Health Sciences, University of Milan, Milan, Italy, 2Applied Research Unit for Cognitive and Psychological Science, IEO Istituto Europeo di Oncologia, Milan, Italy, 3Centre for Research Ethics & Bioethics CRB, University of Uppsala, Uppsala, Sweden. Direct to the consumer genetic test (DTC GT) service is an indisputable and increasing phenomenon which portray internet society. It lets hypothesize that common people search for more health information and more sense of responsibility on their health behaviors. Indeed, proponents of DTC GT ar gue that making consumers able to calculate the relative risk of developing certain diseases may result in improved compliance with health screening practices and more healthful lifestyle choices. The advertisements have a tendency to highlight these benefits and minimize any possible limitations. Moreover, consumers purchase these tests without the obligatory invol vement of the health care provider, leaving free interpretation and use of genetic data. Despite these aspects, no concrete evidence about the attitu des towards, knowledge and use of DTC GT tests by members of the gene ral population exist. Findings of previous researches indicate a low level of awareness of direct to consumer genetic testing impact, because of the hypothetical nature of many studies, use of not representative samples of the population and too little evidence from users. It is necessary to provide a theoretical framework of DTC tests use and to collect systematic data on ABSTRACTS EMPAG POSTERS ESHG 2014 | MILAN, ITALY | WWW. ESHG.

EP12 M From NICE guidance to clinical practice: the challenge of setting up a service for Familial Hypercholesterolaemia M. S. Watson; Wessex Clinical Genetics Service, Southampton, United Kingdom. In 2008 NICE published guidelines for the identification and management of Familial Hypercholesterolaemia (FH). A key priority was the identification of people with FH using DNA cascade testing. This led to a scoping exercise in how to implement this service in the south central region. This included who, where, when & what kind of service. More importantly who would pay? The Wessex FH Cascade Testing is about to be launched in April 2014, commissioned by 12 Clinical Commissioning Groups (CCGs) within the new NHS structure with pump priming by the South Cen tral Cardiovascular Network (SCCVN) and support from the British Heart Foundation (BHF) This is a narrative on how this was achieved, including the challenges of commissioning a new service and the opportunities affor ded and how this has impacted thus far on the Genetic Service as a whole. In March 2013, the Cardiovascular Disease Outcomes Strategy (CVDOS) spe cifically highlighted the need to improve the detection and management of people with Familial Hypercholesterolaemia (FH).Action 5: The NHS Commissioning Board will take the lead, working with the Chief Coroner as appropriate; to improve the processes for identifying inherited cardiac conditions. The National Clinical Director for Heart Disea se will work with all relevant stakeholders to develop and spread good prac tice in relation to FH and sudden cardiac death. EP13 S Developing genetic counselling in Portugal: education, practice and the growing of the profession ÃÂ. Mendes1,2, J. Sequeiros1,3, M. Paneque1,3; 1UnIGENe and Centre for Predictive and Preventive Genetics, Institute for Molecular and Cell Biology University of Porto (CGPP .IBMC UP), Porto, Portugal, 2Family, Health and Community research group, Department of Health Sciences University of Aveiro, Aveiro, Portugal, 3ICBAS University of Porto, Porto, Portugal. As high throughput genomic technologies became widespread and gene tic healthcare workload expands, there is a call for education and training professionals to translate this changing landscape into appropriate care as well as for the health education of general population. In that sense, genetic counsellors are fully skilled professionals that could play an important role on the provision of safe and ethically adequate practice. The first Portuguese genetic counsellors have completed their formal trai ning in 2012. The Portuguese course in genetic counselling is accredited by the European Board on Medical Genetics (EBMG), in accordance with the proposed standards for education and core competences for professional practice, and in line with the harmonizing efforts of professionalÃ¢ÂÂs educati on across different countries and healthcare settings. Moreover, a national association of genetic counselling professionals have been created. With this report we aim to provide evidence on the development of genetic counsel ling in Portugal, its educational program and current challenges on the esta blishment of the profession. A growing body of research focusing diverse settings of the genetic counsel ling provision has been undertaken recently in Portugal. This includes the professionalsÃ¢ÂÂ training needs for effective practice, quality issues of coun selling, or the set of constraints affecting service delivery. Emergent chal lenges to continue the development of genetic counselling in Portugal are the recognition of the genetic counsellor profession, the harmonization of practice at national level, and the development of a clinical and counselling supervision network. EP14 M Reaction of maternity generations to human genetics in Japan H. Moriya1, S. Izumi1, M. Mizoguchi2, S. Mori1, R. Inoue1, N. Terayama1, H. Jono1, R. Aoki3, K. Takahashi1, I. Inoue4; 1Tokai University, Kanagawa, Japan, 2Akita Red Cross Nursing College, Akita, Japan, 3Soka University, Tokyo, Japan, 4National Institute of Genetics, Shizuoka, Japan. Background:Demand for prenatal genetic testing has been increasing in general citizens, despite that they have less literacy on human genetics. This study aimed to educate human genetics to maternal generations and evaluate the reactions to the education and their understandings. Method: We recruited 10 mothers of pre school children who accepted the program. We designed a lecture program, followed by focus group interviews (,FGI), which were conducted twice. After having an event on genetics with child ren, further planning and operation were carried out together with the mo thers, then FGI were conducted again. Main theme of this program was to understand and accept a concept, Ã¢ÂÂeverybody is different therefore everybo dy is valuableÃ¢ÂÂ. The transcript data were qualitatively analyzed. The study protocol was approved by the ethical committee of the affiliated institution. Results: After series of genetic education, participants naturally accepted Ã¢ÂÂeverybody is differentÃ¢ÂÂ. Accordingly, some of them changed their attitude to have more confidence to themselves, and some have more tolerance to the children. Most importantly, participants start thinking that learning genetics is useful for children to stop bullying and discrimination, and want nearby friends to learn about it. Discussion: Through genetic education, negative images of heredity that originally participants possessed were drastically disappeared. Therefore, it is important to educate human genetics and to give messages to recognize human diversity simultaneously. EP15 S And if I announce a genetic rare disease,are there particular recommendations? That must I know? K. MÃ¢ÂÂBailara1, E. Toussaint2, D. Lacombe2; 1University, Bordeaux, France, 2Hospital, Bordeaux, France. For some people, the disease announce is a shock. This announcement is going to change the course of life of the patient and its perception of the future. We know that is not only the subject which is going to receive the im pact of the announcement but a whole family system. Numerous measures implemented have encouraged the improving how the disease is announced to the patient. Indeed, in our presentation, we shall see in what an announce ment of genetic rare disease is a particular announcement. We speak about: the representation of the disease rare genetics, the extreme rarity of these diseases, the absence of Ã¢ÂÂnameÃ¢ÂÂ for many, the notion of orphan disease, the consequences of the dysmorphology, the difficulty giving of the information. ItÃ¢ÂÂs essential that the doctors who announce the genetic rare diseases know what is has the work psychically for a patient, a family confronted with the genetic rare disease. It will be there a facilitator for the announcement and the care of the families. EP16 M Informing best practice in presymptomatic genetic testing for Huntington disease K. K. Barlow Stewart1, A. Howat1, J. Conaghan2; 1University of Sydney, Sydney, Australia, 2Hunter Genetics, Newcastle, Australia. Introduction: International guidelines for offering pre symptomatic gene tic testing for Huntington disease (HD) first developed in 1994 have been recently reviewed (MacLeod et al, 2012). In light of these recent recom mendations, the experience and views of clients who had undergone testing at an Australian HD genetics service operating since 1991 were explored. Method: Semi structured telephone interviews with 14 participants were transcribed, de identified and coded for thematic analysis using NVivo data management software. Results: Six main themes were identified: (1) moti vations for testing; (2) access to services; (3) information and client centred care; (4) perspectives on the guidelines; (5) support person role and im pact; and (6) the afterwards. Motivations for testing were similar to pre vious studies including reducing uncertainty, family planning and to inform risk status of existing children. Participants felt they were seen promptly by the service, that they were provided with sufficient information about testing, their care was client centred and their needs were met at the time of testing. Some participants wanted testing immediately, but understood the rationale in the guidelines for delaying testing until the second coun selling session. Involvement of a support person varied, and those who in volved their support person only at the results giving session described a greater emotional impact of the result on the support person. Some indivi duals reported a significant long term psychological impact after receiving a negative test result. Conclusion: Recommendations for practice include the involvement of support person/s from the initial session, and to provide long term follow up to all individuals undergoing pre symptomatic testing, regardless of result. EP17 S Myotonic dystrophy type 1 families: anticipation as a decision making behavior for presymptomatic DNA testing of asymptomic children A. Shopova1, S. Shopova2, S. Bichev3, A.

Myotonic dystrophy (dystrophia myotonica, DM) is the most frequently inherited neuromuscular disease of adult life. The classical DM, known as ABSTRACTS EMPAG POSTERS ESHG 2014 | MILAN, ITALY | WWW. ESHG. ORG 363Back to inde x Steinert disease or DM type1, is a multisystem disorder with an autosomal dominant inheritance associated with the presence of abnormal expansi on of CTG trinucleotide repeats in DMPK gene on chromosome 19q13.3. Anticipation is a well known phenomenon in DM1. The greater size of the expansion of CTG repeats is associated with earlier onset and more severe symptoms in the following successful generations. This study presents diffe rent decision making choices of parents for presymptomatic DNA testing of their asymptomatic children in DM1 families. This decisions are defined by the following medical and psychological aspects: genetically verified DM1 diagnosis in one of the parents, family history data for a relative with DM1 symptoms, making a choice about the asymptomatic sibling after receiving an information for affected fetus in second pregnancy of DM1 patient.

22274,"BACKGROUND: Approximately 15% of all clinically recognized pregnancies are spontaneously aborted and Ã¢ÂÂ¼60 70% of these are attributable to detec table chromosome abnormalities . Cytogenetic analysis is an important com ponent in the assessment of human malformation in early failed pregnancies. METHODS: A total of 32 patients with missed abortion between 7 11 weeks gestation underwent cytogenetic analysis of chorionic villi, using RÃ¢ÂÂbanding cytogenetic techniques. RESUL TS: Among 32 examined cases, 14 (43,75%) were with abnormal karyotype and rest of 18 (56,25%) were normal. Of the 14 cases with an abnormal karyotype, there were 3 structural abnormalities and 11 numerical aberrations. When analyzed by maternal age, the rate of abnormality for first trimester losses was 38,88% in women younger than 35 years, and 42,85% in those 35 years or older. CONCLUSIONS: A total of 43,75% of the cases with missed abortion had an abnormal karyotype and the percentage was a little higher at advanced maternal age. Karyotyping of spontaneous losses in the first trimester beginning with the patientÃ¢ÂÂs se cond loss provides clinically important etiologic information and decreases the number of evaluations necessary for recurrent pregnancy loss.",2014

Chromosomal abnormalities are a major cause (in 70 %) of miscarriages in the early stage of pregnancy and in the failure of an embryo implanta tion. Many aberrations are of maternal origin. The number of aberrations increases with the age of the woman.530 embryos were analysed from 299 patients with the use of aCGH within the scope of PGS, from that 256 embryos from 158 patients with the heart beat of fetus were used for the calculation of pregnancy rate. The results of IVF cycles of 247 patients withouth PGS was used as a control group. The group of women was further divided into the group A) women younger than 35 years and group B) women over the age of 35. 34,6 % of embryos with aberrations was found in the group A, and 48,1 % of embryos with aberra tions was found in the group B. Total pregnancy rate in both groups with PGS was 63 %. The pregnancy rate was 25,8 % in the group of women older than 35 years without PGS. The percentage of pregnancy rate increased to 68 % in group B. This represents an increase of 42,2 % for IVF success in the group B. The increase of aberrations is obvious after the age of 35, here are the chro mosomal aberrations a clear cause of the failure of IVF. It was confirmed that the exclusion of embryos with chromosomal aberrations can eliminate the effect of the age of woman on the success of IVF.",2014
22276,"Following confirmation of array cgh as first tier diagnostic test for indivi duals with intellectual/ developmental delay, multiple congenital anomalies and autism spectrum disorders there has been a lot of discussions regarding using this test for prenatal diagnosis. In different countries there has been different approach to this case. Considering the possibility on finding CNVs of unknown significance leading to counseling dilemmas the general trend has been to use this technique in cases of ambiguity identified in routine chromosomal karyotype or where a normal karyotype is reported in a sono graphic report of congenital anomalies. In the period of 24 months starting December 2011 till December 2013 we performed array CGH for 32 amnio tic or chorionic villi samples. From these 32 samples, 3were inconclusive and of the 29, 5 showed a significant CNV. 3 of the 5 had problems in their sonography and 2 were being studied for de novo markers. It appears that array CGH Is an instrumentAl tool in clarifying complicated karyotypes and a significant test for fetuses with abnormal sonography findings.",2014
22277,"Introduction: Male factor infertility comprises approximately 30 50% of all infertilities. A great proportion of these patients have spermatogenesis failure with a genetic cause. After Klinefelter syndrome, Y chromosomal mi crodeletions (YCM) in AZF regions are the most frequent cause of male in fertility. There are evidences that male factors can potentially affect fertiliza tion, human embryo development and viability and placental proliferation. According to the recent studies, there is a potential association between Y chromosome microdeletion and recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL). Screening for Y chromosomal microdeletion in AZF region in men with non obstructi ve infertility and spouses of women with RPL was the focus of this study. Material and Methods: This study was carried out with a total of 65 male samples which included 35 non obstructive infertile men, 15 males from couples with RPL and 15 fertile males as a control. Genomic DNA was extrac ted from blood lymphocytes. Screening of AZF deletion was performed by multiplex polymerase chain reaction using 19 sequence tagged sites (STS) sets of primers. Results: In 35 men with non obstructive infertility only 1 subject was detec ted to have Y chromosome microdeletions in SY254 and SY157 and SY255. Results showed no Y chromosome microdeletion in 15 males of couples with RPL and their controls. Conclusion: Amongst the various regions of AZF, often only microdeletion in the AZFc region could end up with fertility, thus mutation screening at the AZFc region is strongly recommended in males whose spouses have recur rent pregnancy loss after ruling out other RPL causes.",2014
22278,"A prospective cytogenetic and molecular study was conducted on 123 Sau di men with azoospermia to estimate the prevalence of common genetic abnormalities associated with male infertility. Routine cytogenetic studies were performed to screen for chromosomal abnormalities whereas multi plex PCR methods were employed to screen for submicroscopic microde letions of the AZFa, b and c regions located on the long arm of the Y chro mosome. Chromosomal abnormalities were detected in 21 patients (17%). Among the 21 patients with cytogenetic abnormalities, 15 (71%) had the KlinefelterÃ¢ÂÂs syndrome 47,XXY karyotype, 4 patients showed different large deletions of the long arm of the Y chromosome with or without 45,X cell line mosaicism, one patient showed low 47,XXY/46,XY mosaicism and one patient had a chromosomal translocation between chromosomes 2 and 5. The molecular studies revealed submicroscopic microdeletions of the Y chromosome in 3 (3%) of the 102 patients with a normal male karyotype. These Y chromosome microdeletions involved regions AZFc in all three ca ses and AZFb in two cases. Our studies revealed that the prevalence of chromosomal abnormalities in azoospermic Saudi patients is similar to that of major international studies. However, the prevalence of submicroscopic Y chromosome microdeletions in patients with a normal karyotype was noticeably lower than what have been reported internationally but consistent with a few studies performed in Arab countries including Saudi Arabia. Our findings therefore strengthen the assumption that other genetic and/or non genetic factors may play a major role in male infertility in Arab patients.",2014

Of 7719 dis orders with suspected Mendelian inheritance, more than 1000 are reces sive with an established molecular basis. Preconception genetic testing and counseling has led to significant declines in the incidence of Tay Sachs di sease and other several severe recessive diseases. And extension of precon ception screening to more severe disease genes has also been attempted in some developed countries. Here, we report a preconception carrier screen for 658 severe recessive childhood diseases in Chinese population. All the exons and their Ã¯Â¬Âanking sequences (ÃÂ±30bp) of 546 target genes were enriched by hybrid capture, se quenced by next generation sequencing (NGS). At a resultant 160x average target coverage, 93% of nucleotides had at least 20x coverage, and mutati on detection/genotyping had ~95% sensitivity and ~100% specificity for substitution, insertion/deletion, splicing, and gross deletion mutations and single nucleotide polymorphisms. In 199 DNA samples (91 males and 106 females), the average genomic car rier burden for severe pediatric recessive mutations was 1.47 and ranged from 0 to 6. The distribution of mutations among sequenced samples ap peared random. Among the 199 individuals,118(59 couples) had once or more times adverse pregnancy outcomes such as miscarriage. The carrier burden of these individuals was 1.89, which is higher than general popu lation. Preconception carrier screening by NGS is feasible to the general populati on, especially the individuals with adverse pregnancy outcomes.

Level II ultrasonography: micrognathia, low set ears, lower limb abnormalities. CGH Array was performed revealing a deletion syndrome of 10,6 Mb on chromosome 6 (locus 6q11q14.1). After termination the fetal pathology showed frontal hypertricosis, small nose, long filtrum, macrostomia, thin lips, micrognathia, and low set ears with abnormal lobes. Case 2: A 41 year old woman in her third pregnancy. During the second tri mester the pregnancy was complicated by intrauterine growth restriction and unilateral fetal club foot. A microdeletion of 496 kb at 17q21.21 was detected by CGH Array. This mutation has been reported in only a limited number of families and with a variable phenotype. After termination the physical examination of the fetus demonstrated high forehead, hyperthelo rism, bulbous nose, thin lips, pointed chin, low set simplified ears, campt odactyly, tales equinovarus, and reduced musculature in the lower limbs. Both deletions were shown to be de novo. Understanding the pathogenesis of fetal anomalies and correlations between the pre and post natal phe notype is difficult and limited because of a lack of prenatal data from ca ses reported after birth.

Aim: to investigate the prevalence and profile of CA among couples with deferent type of reproductive failures, as well as to assess the value of karyotyping in the routine work up of couples, referred for ART . Material and methods: The study included a total of 947 individu als with reproductive failure. They were divided into the following groups: (1) 273 couples with two or more spontaneous abortions; (2) 193 women and 208 men from couples with infertility +/ one or more unsuccessful IVF procedure. All patients were analyzed cytogenetically for detection of major chromosomal abnormalities. Results: Chromosomal abnormalities were found in 26 (2.74%) of all inve stigated individuals, 10 (2.08%) males and 16 (3.43%) females. The deter mined prevalence of CA was 4.76% among couples with recurrent aborti ons (4 times more frequently in women than in men) and 3.24% in indivi duals (more frequently men) with infertility. The most common type of CA in group (1) (92% of these cases) are balanced structural rearrangements, carried mainly (83%) by female; in group (2) Ã¢ÂÂ CA of sex chromosome (62% of these cases), more frequently (62%) in male. Conclusion: The results of current study demonstrate the significance of chromosomal pathology in etiology of reproductive failure and emphasise the need for thorough ge netic work up in couples referred for infertility.

Ge netic pathology is an important part of the general human pathology due to the increasing number of genetic diseases. The purpose of this study was to establishing a correlation between the presence of structural and numerical chromosomal abnormalities in one of the partners and their reproductive development. METHODS During the period from August 2007 to December 2011, 2195 pa tients with reproduction problems, who had received in our hospital, were investigated for this retrospective study, and the frequency of chromosomal abnormalities was calculated. The control group consists of 83 fertile coup les who had one or more children in history, was investigated by karyotype. RESULTS Of the 2195 patients investigated by classical cytogenetic techni ques 91.12% had normal karyotype and 8.88% had chromosomal abnorma lities, the most common chromosomal changes are polymorphisms. Nume rical chromosomal abnormalities were detected in the proportion of 0.65% in infertile men and 0.62% in infertile women in the study group. CONCLUSIONS: Recently a possible association between infertility and chro mosomal abnormalities have been reported with a significant statistically association. Our study shows that there is not association between chro mosomal abnormalities and infertility problems,but this study needs to be confirmed with further investigations on a larger control group to establish the role of chromosomal aberrations in the etiology of infertility.",2014

In the last years it was taken in consi deration the hypothesis that not only somatic chromosomal anomalies but also germ cells chromosomal aberrations could lead to reproductive failu re. Aim: In this study we used multicolor FISH probes for chromosome 13, 18, 21, X and Y to evaluate the aneuploidy incidence in sperm cells from infertile males. Methods: The study lot included 35 males with infertility and oligoasthe noteratozoospermia (OAT) and 20 males with normal fertility and normal semen characteristics for which the conventional cytogenetic investigation using peripheral blood revealed a normal karyotype. The fluorescent signals for these chromosomes, were analysed at least 10000 cells/patient. Results: The overall chromosome disomy and nulisomy in OAT group was higher than the one identified in the control group. By comparing the in cidence of the disomy in the OAT group, the highest incidence was the sex chromosome disomy, followed by the disomy of chromosomes 13, 21 (equal values) and then 18. The nulisomy incidence in the OAT group was higher for sex chromosomes, followed by the nulisomy of autosomes 13, then 21 and 18.Conclusion: During these days, for patients with OAT , intra cytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) is frequently used, and it is important to inform the patients that the use of spermatozoa for fertilization could be associated with an increased risk of aneuploidies in embryos.",2014

22290,"Introduction Down syndrome (DS or trisomy 21) is a genetic disease re sulting from the presence of an extra copy of chromosome 21. Although advanced maternal age represents the major risk factor for DS, most of DS children are born from women less than 30 years of age and is seems that different mechanisms are responsible for chromosome 21 nondisjunction in young women compared to older ones, each of them potentially affected by an impaired folate/Hcy metabolism. The objective of this study was to evalu ate the correlation between gene polymorphisms MTHFD G1958A and RFC1 G80A and the risk of Down syndrome. Materials and methods Our study included 26 women that gave birth to DS babies and 46 control mothers of healthy children.

22291,"Endometriosis, defined as the presence of endometrial tissue outside of the uterus, is an estrogen dependent chronic inflammatory condition as sociated with degrees of pelvic pain and infertility. Toll like receptors play a key role in immune response, by regulating inflammatory reactions and activating adaptive immune response to eliminate infectious pathogens and cancer debris. Polymorphisms in TLR4 have been shown to be associated with increased susceptibility to diseases such as inflammation and cancer. Ectodomain of TLR4 protein consists of 21 leucine rich repeats (LRRs) that are crucial for its dimerization and signaling. The aim of this study was to determine gene variations of TLR4 in patients with endometriosis. Sixty three blood samples were recruited from endometriosis patients re ferring to Royan Institute along 2012 13, who have been confirmed by lapa roscopic surgery. Ethical approval forms were obtained prior to the samples collection. The control group was consisted of fertile women who had no history of inflammatory disease or using any related drugs. DNA was extracted by kit, special primers were designed, the LRR coding region was amplified by PCR and products were analyzed by sequencing. among 63 patient, 6 of them had a heterozygote single nucleotide polymor phism (SNP) (rs120475167) G/A which changes aa E to K, and 4 patients had heterozygote SNP (rs120475108) G/A (aa R to K), and 2 patients had heterozygote SNP (rs120475032) G/A(aa D to N).According to our finding we suggest that the three aforementioned new SNPs in TLR4 gene can be associated with endometriosis.

22301,"Genomic imprinting is an epigenetic phenomenon, which is involved in re gulation of embryonic development and placental function. Previously we have reported that the multilocus methylation defects (MLMD) at imprinted genes may be among molecular processes, which are responsible for dys function of imprinted loci in pathology of early embryonic development. We hypothesize that MLMD at imprinted genes may cause karyotypically normal miscarriage, particularly among women experiencing recurrent miscarriage. Differential methylation of 51 imprinted genes were examined in first trimester spontaneous abortions (SA) from women who have re current (group RPL, from 9 (data of GoldenGate Methylation Cancer Panel) to 105 (Methylation specific PCR (MSP) SA) and single (group SPL, from 6 (data of GoldenGate Methylation Cancer Panel) to 114 (MSP) SA) pregnancy loss. Sixty induced abortions were investigated as a control group. All spon taneous and induced abortions had the normal karyotype. Our results provide evidence that MLMD at imprinted genes in the group RPL was more frequent than that in SPL (15x10 2 and 5.2x10 2, respectively, p<0.01) with predominance of somatic epimutations (10x10 2 and 3.9x10 2 respectively, p<0.01) and multiple hypomethylation (9x10 2 and 4.4x10 2 re spectively, p<0.01). Frequency of MLMD in both groups at maternal loci was higher than that at paternal one (12x10 2 and 6.4x10 2, respectively, p<0.05 for RPL; 3.6x10 2 and 1.4x10 2, respectively, p<0.01 for SPL). Therefore, the RPL is characterized by multilocus somatic hypomethylation of imprinted genes and MLMD at imprinted genes on maternal loci that associated with abnormal maintenance of maternal imprinting in somatic cells.",2014

This condition is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, but most cases result from new mutations in the gene. HOS is characterized by skeletal abnormalities of the hands and arms (upper limbs) and heart problems. The diagnosis of HOS can be esta blished clinically. Clinical signs include upper limbs malformations, anoma lous heart structure (eg. atrioseptal and ventriculoseptal defects or Fallot tetrada) and cardiac conduction disease, which can cause bradycardia or tachycardia. HOS can be confirmed through TBX5 gene mutation molecular genetic testing DNA sequence analysis or array comparative genomic hy bridization (array CGH). A case report of Holt Oram syndrome in 6 month girl is represented from Kaunas hospital of LUHS, when mother has been taking a valproic acid 500mg/day during pregnancy for epilepsy treatment. The antiepileptic drug valproic acid has teratogenic side effect and is a po tent inducer of neural tube defects and other abnormalities, such as car diac, skeletal and limb deffects. When valproic acid cannot be avoidened in pregnancy, the lowest possible effective dose should be prescribed. Also it is recommended to use folic acid to 5 mg/day.

HOXA10 gene has a well characterized role in uterine organogenesis during embryo nic development and functional endometrial differentiation and growth in adults. It is actively involved in cell proliferation through the regulation of hundreds of genes. To evaluate the expression profile of HOXA10 gene during menstrual cycle, endometrial tissues were collected from 21 healthy fertile women under going laparoscopy for tubal ligation surgery, in menstruation, proliferative and secretory phases. For this respect ethical approval and informed patient consent was gained for the use of tissue sample. Total RNA was extracted from tissues using TRIzol reagent and cDNA was subsequently synthesized. Quantitative expression analysis was performed using the real time PCR sy stem. Results showed stage dependent manner of HOXA10 gene expression in en dometrium tissues as notably increase of expression level in the secretory phase in comparison to the menstruation and proliferative phases. This finding suggests that HOXA10 gene may have an important role in re gulating endometrial cells proliferation and development in menstrual cycle and it is important for establishing conditions necessary for implantation. Up regulation of HOXA10 in secretory phase during the window of implan tation may be one of the potential molecular mechanisms of fertility .This gene can be noted as one of the candidate genes that its aberrant expression may contribute to the etiology of infertility and gynecological disorders.",2014

Hyperprolactinemia is seen in a group of infertile women .These women are treated for this problem because high amounts of prolactin can affect fertili ty by changing LH and FSH quantity. The increase in prolactin levels could be due to a disorder in the prolactin receptor, so investigating the geneome of this receptor which is located on chromosome 5 might be useful in finding the reason for this problem. In this study, the infertile women referred to Royan infertility institute, dia gnosed with idiopathic hyperprolactinemia whose pituitary MRI results were normal, were compared with the control group who were fertile wo men, for any changes in their prolactin receptor gene. The techniques used in this study were PCR SSCP and Sequencing .the DNA was extracted from the blood samples by salting out method and then amplified by the polyme rase chain reaction .The purified PCR products, were sequenced by the san ger sequencing technique in order to confirm the SSCP result. No change in any of the eleven exons of the prolactin receptor gene was detected neither in control group nor in the patients group, consequently it can be concluded that idiopathic hyperprolactinemia in the affected infertile women, is not in association with any change in the genome of the prolactin receptor.

The inhibitor of DNA binding family members (ID1,ID2,ID3,ID4) inhibit acti vity of basic helix loop helix transcription factor and have an important role in cell growth ,differentiation and angiogenesis. Due to the high proliferation and angiogenesis in the endometrial lining of the uterus during the menstrual cycle, it seems that this gene family may be involved in the occurrence characteristics of this tissue. This study focused on expression of ID gene family by real time PCR in 21 healthy fertile women undergoing tubal ligation surgery, between 20 45 years old to investigate the possible role of this gene family in endometrial tissue changes during three phases (menstrual ,proliferative , secretory) of menstrual cycle. For this respect ethical approval and informed patient con sent was gained for the use of tissue sample. Data revealed high levels of mRNA expression for ID1, ID2, ID3 and ID4 in proliferative phase. Also, all members of this gene family showed more si gnificant expression levels during the secretory phase than the proliferative phase of the menstrual cycle. These results suggest for the first time that ID gene family has a dynamic role in the proliferation and angiogenesis of endometrial cells. We propose that changes in expression pattern of this family can be reviewed in gyneco logic disorder and infertility that related to embryo implantation.",2014

In the present study the application of two genetic markers including rs11658369 and rs8066853 markers located in AIPL1 genetic region were genotyped and their application were investigated in prenatal diagnosis of the disease in the Iranian population. The markers were genotyped using newly designed specific primers by Tetra primer ARMS PCR in 150 unrelated healthy individuals in the Iranian population. Analysis of the genotyping data using GenPop program, indicated the pre sence of informative haplotypes (>5%) with strong linkage disequilibrium for the markers and the AIPL1 gene. The efficiency of these haplotypes as a suitable tool in prenatal diagnosis of LCA was evaluated in two Iranian families with one affected child with an already diagnosed W278X mutation in the AIPL1 gene, through an APEX microarry screening and sequencing analysis. The transmission of the normal and affected alleles form parents to their affected child and the fetus was confirmed by using the haplotypes obtained by genotyping of rs11658369 and rs8066853 markers. Interestin gly, in line with the mutation results, the genotyping data also confirmed the transmission of normal alleles to fetuses. The families now were given birth to children with normal vision as confirmed by ophthalmic diagnosis.

Analysis was conducted among 226 families with one miscarriage, 277 families with two miscarriages, 117 families with three miscarriages in history. The comparison group consisted of 201 families in history, which marked the birth of a healthy baby. Conducted under the EBM calculations showed that the presence of relatives in the pedigrees of families of women with reproductive losses is IP , 2,47 (CI 95% 1,62:3,75 ) . Among the male relatives of the families of miscarriage, this indicator was IP , 2,18 (CI 95% 1,27:3,59 ). In general, the odds ratio for relatives with re productive disorders, excluding sex pedigrees in groups with reproductive losses and in the comparison group was IP , 2,79 (CI 95% 1,95:3,98). Thus, in families with reproductive losses 2.5 times more relatives with reproduc tive disorders, compared with the families of the comparison group.

AF samples: when there is a need to for a rapid response in cases of ad vanced maternal age, clinical suspicion of fetal anomaly or in amniocentesis performed late (more than 20 weeks)2. CVS samples: in all cases, in conjunction with cytogenetic analysis of cy totrophoblast by direct preparation (STC) or to exclude maternal contami nation in chorionic villus DNA used in molecular studies. Over the last three years, we extended QF PCR analysis to recurrent miscarriages because tra ditional cytogenetic testing is labour intensive and has a signiÃ¯Â¬Âcant failure rate, especially when the sample quality is poor. In this case we investigate a greater number of chromosomes: 13, 15, 16, 18, 21, 22, X and Y, whose aneuploidies are the major cases of miscarriage. In this work we report a summary of our experience, using CE IVD QF PCR systems CY5 labelled. In prenatal diagnosis QF PCR system proved to be an effective and specific support to cytogenetic analysis, and a useful and re liable tool to diagnose aneuploidies in spontaneous miscarriages, reaching a pathologyÃ¢ÂÂs diagnosis in 45% of cases and weÃ¢ÂÂre considering to replace cytogenetic analysis with this molecular system.",2014
22322,"Background: as previous studies have mentioned that sperm DNA quali ty may be related to unexplained recurrent abortion, this association study was designed to evaluate the degree of sperm DNA fragmentation using the SCSA (Sperm Chromatin Structure Assay) on sperm from couples with un explained recurrent abortion compared to sperm from men of the general population without evidences of infertility, as control group. Method: After collection of ejaculated sperm from 60 couples with recurrent abortion and 30 couples with proven fertility, semen specimen were freezed by placing aliquots immediately under neat freezing conditions using liquid nitrogen. After thawing at approximately 37ÃÂ°C, sperm cells were stained with fluo rescent intercalating dye, Acridine orange, after exposure to acidic condi tions. Flow cytometry analysis was used to separate ssDNA as fragmented DNA from dsDNA as integrated DNA reported as DFI (DNA Fragmentation Index). Current references indicate that DFI more than 27% correlates with poor fertility potential. Results: In this study significant relationship between DFI over 27% of couples with recurrent pregnancy loss (43.3%) compared to normal group (13.3%) was observed (p<0.05). Discussion: The SCSA technique is considered to be the most time and cost effective, precise and repeatable technique for sperm DNA fragmentation assay. Due to the noticeable rate of abortion cases in iranian population, sperm DNA fragmentation analysis should be considered as a contributing factor in this incidence, as a screening test. Therefore treatment of DNA fragmentation may be important in reducing abortions.",2014
22323,"Recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL) is defined as the miscarriage of two or more consecutive pregnancies in the first or early second trimester of gestation. RPL may be associated with several factors including endocrine, anatomi cal, psychological, infectious, thrombotic, genetic, or immunological causes. Approximately 50% of cases remain unexplained, Thus, treatments are only marginally successful. The majority of the testing for RPL assesses the wo man, however, male factor is rarely discussed and has been poorly evaluated in RPL. The Y chromosome partial microdeletions including gr/gr microde letion have been associated as a risk factor for infertility. The aim of the pre sent study was to investigate whether Y chromosome gr/gr microdeletions was associated with RPL in a Iranian population. Methods: The subjects were 88 male partners of couples where the female partner had experienced t or more RPLs. Fifty proven fertile males from the general population were also analysed as a control group. DNA extracted from peripheral blood was tested for Y chromosome gr/gr microdeletion using a multiplex PCR. Results: gr/gr deletion was detected in 7 (8.64%) patients and 2(4.16%) fertile controls.

Sex chromosome structural abnormalities are frequently found in indivi duals with reproductive failure or disorders of sexual development. X chro mosome rearrangements are identified in patients with TurnerÃ¢ÂÂ syndrome, usually in a mosaic form. The most frequent structural abnormality in these cases is the X isochromosome for long arms, although a ring X chromosome or other variants can also be found. Additionally, other X rearrangements are detected in patients referred for reproductive failure, infertility or even in woman with no clinical indication, including X translocations, partial de letions or duplications. In balanced X autosome translocations, breakpoint position and replication behavior may influence phenotypic outcome. Rear rangements on the Y chromosome include: X Y translocations, Y autosome translocations, isochromosomes, rings, partial deletions and inversions. Di centric Y isochromosomes for the short arm or ring Y chromosomes are the most frequent abnormal Y chromosomes found in infertile patients and in Turner syndrome, in mosaic with 45,X cells. In all these cases, it is important to well characterize the derivative chromosomes in order to establish a good genotype phenotype correlation, to provide information about the role of different X/Y chromosome regions or loci in the clinical manifestations of patients. For this purpose, we have collected patients with different sex chromosome rearrangements detected with karyotyping: X autosome translocations (3); X isochromosome (3), X deletions (4); ring X (1); X inversion (1); Y autoso me translocations (4); Y isochromosome (1).

All such aberrations are not well characterized into syndromes; however, cause mal formation and mental retardation. We describe chromosomal pattern in 256 children presented with congenital malformation, growth and mental retardation. Peripheral blood samples were processed for conventional G banding analysis. Numerical and structural abnormalities are presented in the table below. A total of 106 children (41%) were detected predominantly with Down (65%) and rarely with Edward (3%) and Patau syndrome (1%). Among sex chromosomal abnormalities, Turner syndrome (12%) was high er than Klinefelter syndrome (1%). Down syndrome and Turner syndrome were of both classic and variant pattern. One child had both trisomy 21 and XXY pattern presenting Down syndrome and Klinefelter syndrome together, which might reflect a complex growth pattern at pubertal age. Structural abnormality was detected in 18% where autosomes were involved in 14% children. Phenotypic expression of these cases was not always straightfor ward for diagnosis of a typical syndrome and thus, a phenotype karyotype correlation was essential for understanding clinical management. The detail data on 256 children highlights the necessity of routine karyotyping for cli nical understanding, and also for genetic counseling of parents for introdu cing a preventive module.

22345,"Introduction: The relation between microdeletions in the Y chromosome and developing male infertility has been studied in several populations. The majority of published studies were designed according to the European Academy of Andrology (EAA) and European Molecular Genetics Quality Net work (EMQN) guidelines for the better detection of AZF (Azoospermic fac tor) microdeletions. However, there are several reports indicating that using the EAA and EMQN suggested sequence tagged site (STS) markers will re sult in false positive and false negative results at least in detection of AZFa microdeletions. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the accuracy of recommended STS markers for detection of AZFa microdeletion in Iranian patients with non obstructive azoospermia. Methods: A total of 100 Iranian non obstructive azoospermic infertile men and 100 proven fertile men were selected for the molecular study of Y chro mosome microdeletions in the AZFa region according to the EAA and EMQN guideline using sY84 and sY86 STS markers. In addition, the presence of sY176 and sY182 STS markers was investigated using multiplex polymerase chain reaction (M PCR).Results: Using sY84 and sY86 primers, we found only one patient who had AZFa microdeletion. However, with the use of sY176 and sY182 markers three new patients were detected with AZFa microdeletion. Conclusion: It seems that the primers and STS markers recommended by the EAA and EMQN guidelines may not apply to all populations and it is re commended to design a population based STS panel at least for the study of AZFa region for better detection of microdeletions.",2014

We developed qCarrier, an NGS based approach targeting +4000 known mutations in over 200 genes causing recessive diseases, for testing couples undergoing assisted reproductive treatments in order to reduce the odds of passing a recessive or X linked disorder to the offspring. In contrast to SNP genotyping platforms, NGS technologies are not limited to detecting previously known or certain types of mutations (i.e. point mu tations or small indels), and can efficiently detect a wider range of disease causing mutations. The qCarrier is based in sequence capture, followed by high throughput sequencing Bioinformatic analysis is keystone in the pro cess, as it combines algorithms optimized for the identification and annota tion of different types of mutations (point mutations, indels, copy number and balanced rearrangements).For analytical validation of the test, we obtained DNA from 57 unrelated in dividuals: 39 patients and 18 previously genotyped controls. The validation set was composed of 49 different known mutations, including 29 SNVs, 13 indels and 25 CNVs causing diseases such as cystic fibrosis, phenylketon uria, spinal muscular atrophy, hypothyroidism, thalassemia, or Duchenne muscular dystrophy. All but one (48/49) different mutations were correctly scored in the blinded study and only one deletion type mutation remained undetected. This information allowed us to finely tune the algorithm to re ach maximum sensitivity. All single nucleotide changes were validated and no known recessive mutations were called in the control samples. After initial deployment in the clinical setting we assessed the presence of disease causing recessive mutations in 52,1% of the analyzed samples (11/21).",2014

22349,"Introduction: Uterine leiomyomas are non cancerous tumors arising from the smooth muscle layer of the uterus that may grow as a single tumor or in clusters. Despite their benign nature, fibroids can cause a variety of health problems including, abnormal menstrual heavy bleeding, pelvic pressure and pain, pregnancy complications and reproductive problems. It has been suggested that mutations clustered in exon 2 of the MED12 gene, located on Xq13.1, are responsible for a majority of uterine leiomyomas. According to the role of ethnicity in developing fibroids, the aim of the present study was to investigate the frequency of MED12 exon 2 mutations in uterine leio myomas of Iranian patients. Methods: Genomic DNA was extracted from 50 fresh uterine leiomyomas tissue samples by a phenol chloroform method. PCR SSCP was used to de tect mutations in the MED12 exon 2 and the flanking intronic regions. Frag ments with altered banding patterns were sequenced on an ABI 3730XL automated DNA sequencer. Results: Five type of MED12 gene heterozygous mutations were detected in 24 (48%) of the leiomyomas samples including, 12 (24%) missense mutati ons, 5 (10%) in frame deletions, 4 (8%) single nucleotide variants affecting splicing,1 (2%) deletions/insertion deletions spanning the intron 1 exon 2 boundary resulting in exon skipping, and 2 (4%) frame shift deletions. No mutation was detected in normal myometrial tissue. Conclusion: Our study confirms the role of MED12 mutations in the patho genesis of uterine leiomyomas, regardless of ethnicity. Therefore the gene could be an appropriate therapeutic target for uterine leiomyomas.",2014
22350,"Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) is a complex genetic endocrine disor der among the women of reproductive age. Hyper androgenemia is one of the main clinical features of PCOS. Aromatase, the key enzyme for estrogen biosynthesis, is encoded by CYP19A1 which is comprised of an unusually large regulatory region including 10 tissue specific promoters. In human cells CYP19A1 is expressed in gonads via promoter PII. The aim of this study is to evaluate the acetylation and methylation levels of lysine 9 of histone 3 (H3K9ac and H3K9me2), in PII promoter region of CYP19A1 in granulosa cells of PCOS patients referred to Royan Institute for in vitro fertilization (IVF).Six women under ovulation induction treatments for IVF consisting of three PCOS patients and three controls (women without ovulation problems; non PCOS) groups were selected. For this respect, ethical approval form was filled before any experiment. We sequenced PII of CYP19A1 to confirm no genetic variations. After ovary puncture, follicular fluid was collected and granulosa cells were extracted via Sil Select Plus gradient. Specific histone modifications were quantified via chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) coupled with real time PCR. Our results clearly demonstrate that in PCOS patients, incorporation of H3K9ac in PII of CYP19A1 is significantly higher than non PCOS patients, whereas, the level of H3K9me2 in PCOS patients is decreased compared with the control group (p<0.05). For the first time our experiments suggest that epigenetic alterations via histone modification in PII promoter of CYP19A1 can play a critical role in the development of PCOS.",2014
22351,"High level of chromosomal mosaicism is observed during global epigenetic reprogramming in early human embryogenesis. Previously, we have shown a high incidence of epimutations at RB1 gene (16.4 ÃÂ10 2) in placental tis sues of aneuploid embryos with mosaicism. Moreover, hypermethylation of RB1 promoter was associated with smaller size of aneuploid clone. It was suggested that epimutations of RB1 are signs of global disturbance of epige netic landscape in aneuploid placenta. To attend this question we analyzed level of retrotransposon LINE 1 promoter DNA methylation in the extraem bryonic mesoderm and the cytotrophoblast cells of embryos with complete and mosaic aneuploid karyotype with (n , 14) and without (n ,20) RB1 promoter epimutation, euploid miscarriages (n , 17) and induced aborti ons with normal karyotype (n , 19). There were no differences of LINE 1 methylation between extraembryonic mesoderm and cytotrophoblast cells in all studied groups. DNA methylation index of LINE 1 was significantly higher in group of mosaic aneuploid embryos with RB1 epimutation (58%) in comparison with complete and mosaic aneuploid embryos without RB1 epimutation (53%), euploid miscarriages (42%), and induced abortions with normal karyotype (52.5%) (p<0.01). Thus, for the first time we have shown that epimutation of RB1 gene promoter is accompanied by hyper methylation of repeated genome sequences in first trimester miscarriages with aneuploidy.

We aimed to evaluate the expression of the adiponectin and its receptors (AdipoR1 and AdipoR2) genes in immature and mature PCOS rat model that were exposed prenatally to androgen excess. Methods: Four pregnant Wistar rats in the experimental group were treated by subcutaneous injection of 5 mg free testosterone on day 20 of pregnancy while the controls (n,4) received only 500 ml of solvent. Female pups (14 cases and 18 controls) of each mother were randomly divided into 3 groups and sacrificed at 3 stages of life: day 0 (new born, n,10), day10 (10 day old, n,10), and day 75 85(adult, n,12). RNAs were extracted from ovarian tis sues and relative expression levels for adiponectin and its receptors genes were measured using TaqMan Real Time PCR. Results: The expression levels of investigated genes were not significantly elevated in newborns (Adiponectin: 1.119, AdipoR1: 1.594, AdipoR2:1.112 fold), while a significant decrease was detected in 10 day old rats (Adi ponectin 0.292, AdipoR1 0.26, and AdipoR2 0.161 fold (pÃ¢ÂÂ¤0.05)). We also observed a marginally significant increase in adiponectin gene expression at puberty (2.682 fold, p,0.08).Conclusion: The results of this study showed that the expression of adi ponectin and its receptor genes is changed in prenatally androgenized rats. These changes may alter the normal expression of steroidogenesis regula tory genes and consequently impair the normal development of ovaries and follicles.",2014

Reciprocal CNVs as high confidence CNVs validated by qPCR. Functional analysis was performed by Gene Ontology (GO). About 60 CNVs was observed in each fetus. The frequency of reciprocal CNVs varied from 2 to 18. Analysis of CNVs by array CGH and qPCR showed that changes were not mostly integer multiples. Some of CNVs were shared bet ween both fetuses, some were found in the same tissues and some in diffe rent tissues. GO showed that altered genes are mostly involved in embryonic development. Tissues clustering according to CNVs revealed those from the same embryonic origin in some cases are close together in a cluster; ho wever, there were large disagreements with clustering of embryonic layers derivatives. According to distribution pattern of frequent CNVs their origin should be early development, some preimplantation and some postimplantatation. CNVs with low frequency seem to be occurred in later stages. Each organ inherits CNVs with a unique pattern regarding extensive cell mixing/migra tion in embryonic development.

We studied the distribution of 5 methylcytosine (5mC) and 5 hydroxyme thylcytosine (5hmC) in human spermatogenic cells from testicular biopsy and ejaculate samples. Among analyzed dividing cells several types were detected: mitotic diploid and polyploid spermatogonia and meiotic sper matocytes at the pachytene, diplotene and diakinese stages. Chromosomes were identified by QFH/AcD staining. Cytosine modifications were detected by indirect immunofluorescence. The distribution of 5mC in mitotic chromosomes from spermatogonia was band specific: R bands and pericentromeric heterochromatin of chromoso mes 1, 9 and 16 were enriched in 5mC. Pachytene chromosomes showed less obvious 5mC banding, with the most intensive DNA methylation in the peritelomeric regions. Diplotene and diakinese cells demonstrated high, but almost homogeneous DNA methylation with increased intensity of signal in chiasmas and heterochromatic regions. Mature spermatozoa contained 5mC. 5hmC was completely absent in mitotic and meiotic chromosomes of sper matogenic cells. Hydroxymethylation was identified in 8.8% of post meiotic (haploid) spermatid nuclei and in up to 13.89% of spermatozoa, suggesting that they are actively demethylated. Thus, mitotic chromosomes from spermatogonia and meiotic chromoso mes from spermatocytes demonstrate band specific methylation patters, but lack 5hmC. The presence of 5hmC in some post meiotic spermatids and spermatozoa suggests that genome of these cells undergoes active DNA de methylation.

Retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) is a complex disease affecting the deve lopment of retinal vasculature in premature infants. The International clas sification of ROP divides the development of the disorder into 5 stages. The environmental factors can influence the development of ROP , so the appro priate care may decrease its incidence. However, a genetic predisposition to ROP is suggested. Recently, mutations in genes FZD4, LRP5, TSPAN12, and NDP , were ide identified in 3 to 12% of the cases with ROP . Nowadays, our cohort consists of 11 premature newborns with different stages of ROP (sta ge 1 3) treated at the Clinic of Neonatology in Martin. We performed the se quence analysis of the coding exons of the three genes FZD4, TSPAN12 and NPD an identified rs61749246 (c.*2GÃÂT of the FZD4 gene) in 3 patients with ROP .

The rs61749246 (MAF , 0.008 in dSNP) is the polymorphisms of the second G after the TAA stop codon of the FZD4 gene. It has been shown, that there are preferred nucleotides around the stop codon necessary for efficient translational termination. We suggest that this SNP is involved in the pathogenesis of ROP , probably based on gene expression changes during the eye development. We will enlarge our cohort focusing on higher stages of ROP and develop in vitro translation assay for this SNP .",2014

According to the preliminary functional analysis, pathologic changes (caused by mutations of GJB2 and GJB6 genes) did not comprise spiral ganglion cells, which are crucial for the results of cochlear implantation. The aim of our study was to estimate the prevalence of genetically related HI among patients with cochlear implants (CI). We have analyzed 1218 pa tients diagnosed with congenital hearing loss who received CI. Search for mutations was performed by various molecular methods. Our results shows that genetic defects of various genes are the most common reason of HI among patients with cochlear implants.",2014
22362,"Non syndromic deafness is one of the most common sensory impairment in humans. Most forms of non syndromic deafness are associated with perma nent hearing loss caused by damage to structures in the inner ear. The se verity of hearing loss varies, can change over time and can occur at any age. The cause of non syndromic deafness is complex, with more than hundred genes so far identified; however, some of these genes have not been fully characterized. Different mutations in the same gene can be associated with different types of hearing loss All this aspects contribute to the complexity of the disease and markedly hamper DNA diagnostics. In this study we focused on gene KCNQ4, whose mutations lead to DFNA2, a subtype of autosomal dominant non syndromic deafness that is characte rized by progressive sensor neural hearing loss across all frequencies. The KCNQ4 gene encodes protein called potassium voltage gated channel KQT like protein 4, which is part of a protein family that forms channels to trans port positively charged potassium atoms between neighboring cells. In our work we analyzed 324 NSHL patients without mutations in Gjb2 gene, which is most prevalent disease gene. Up to now we found one new deletion in gene KCNQ4 in exon 10 that causes frame shift, some pathological muta tions and also several frequent polymorphisms.",2014
22363,"Keratoconus is a noninflammatory corneal thinning disorder and the major cause of cornea transplantations in the Western countries. Despite intensi ve biochemical and genetic investigations, its underlying cause(s) remains poorly understood. It has been suggested that mutations in VSX1 and SOD1 may contribute to disease presentation in some cases. Linkage analysis in an affected Irish pedigree ultimately in 2011 led to identification of a mutation in the seed region of MIR184 (+57C>T) as the putative cause of keratoconus in the pedigree. In a subsequent screening of 790 patients of European or Indian descent, two novel causative mutations (+3A>G, +8C>A) in MIR184 were identified. Notably, mutations in MIR184 have recently been reported in two pedigrees, each affected with ocular diseases that affect the cornea. MiRNA 184 is the most abundant miRNA of the cornea. Here, MIR184 was screened in 47 unrelated Iranians affected with keratoconus by direct San ger sequencing. Only one variant allele (+39G>T; rs41280052) was obser ved in one patient. The same variation has previously been observed in con trol and keratoconus affected individuals at similar frequencies, suggesting that it is not a cause of keratoconus. Although the sample size was small, it is evident that mutations in MIR184 are not a common cause of keratoconus among Iranian patients. They were not observed among the 94 chromoso mes of the patients screened.",2014
22364,"Keratoconus (KTCN) is a thinning and anterior protrusion of the cornea resulting in altered refractive powers, and loss of visual acuity. KTCN is a multifactorial disorder in which both environmental and genetic factors are involved. Among the environmental factors, frequent eye rubbing and contact lenses wearing are mentioned. Family form of the disease and the coexistence with other genetic disorders indicate genetic factor involve ment. Genetic studies have led to the identification of several loci on dif ferent chromosomes, linked to KTCN. However, only few reports indicated causative genes in these loci. Such examples are DOCK9, and MIR184. For most of the remaining KTCN loci, single genes were analyzed. Additionally, majority of previous reports concentrated on sequences variants in exons only. This leaves a gap in the studies of KTCN genetics. The aim of this project was to analyze the DNA sequence information avai lable in the databases of SNVs located within known KTCN loci. Previous studies in KTCN focused on protein coding sequences. We extended the ana lyzes to include miRNA genes located in analyzed loci to investigate another genetic factor toward assessment of KTCN complexity. Additionally, sequen cing of mitochondrial genome in KTCN patients from Polish population was performed and the data was incorporated into genetic analysis. The KTCN development does not depend on a single change in the gene, but on the accumulation of numerous sequence variants. The complexity of KTCN etiology causes the need to find appropriate approach to investigate this disease. Support: National Science Centre, Poland, grant no. 2011/03/N/NZ5/01470",2014

We examined 53 girls and 24 boys aged 4 17 yr from Rus sian population: 19(38 eyes) with high myopia, 44(88 eyes) with medium myopia, and 14(28 eyes) with emmetropia. The gene polymorphism was identified with PCR RFLP . We have found a higher proportion of carriers of VDR A( 3731)allele in the medium myopia group compared to the em metropia group (32% and 7%, respectively, OR,4,45, 95%CI 1,13 17,53, p,0,016). It is known that the variation of the A( 3731) allele frequency is significant between various populations, being the highest one in Africans (about 74%) and the lowest one in Caucasians (about 19%). The A( 3731) allele is an ancestral while the allele G( 3731) is mutant. Null hypothesis for explaining the mutant allele frequency raise in Caucasians is that this is a result of a random selection, for example, genetic drift during the period of human migration out of Africa. Alternative hypothesis is that the difference in the polymorphism variation is not random, being the result of natural selection. The latter may be true if the G( 3731) allele gives some benefits for survival outside Africa. We hypothesize that the vitamin D receptor is a key regulator of the eye growth, and G( 3731) allele gives more benefits in preventing against myopic eye growth. The increase in G( 3731) allele rates in non African populations might be explained by changing of ultraviolet radiation intensity.",2014

WS1 and WS3 are both caused by mutation in the PAX3 gene. The overall incidence is 1/42,000 to 1/50,000 people. Here we report on 12 patients with WS (24 eyes, 4 boys and 8 girls aged from 4 mn to 15 yr). The period of follow up supervision of the patients lasted from 6 mn to 15 yr. 7 patients had mothers with WS, the rest had parents without WS symptoms. Routine basic ophthalmic, pe diatric and audiological observation was performed for all patients. All of them suffered from congenital sensorineural deafness. Ophthalmic status of all patients included dystopia canthorum, epicanthus, heterochromia irides. 5 patients (10 eyes) suffered from congenital ptosis, converging strabismus with surgical correction. 10 children (20 eyes) had refraction anomaly as hypermetropia and astigmatism corrected with spectacles. 2 patients (4 eyes) had refraction anomaly with nystagmus.

Methods: Selecting pedigrees have been done with considering some clini cal criteria and homozygosity mapping with flanking STR markers following conventional sequencing were performed the effect of the novel identified alteration on RNA folding was assessed using the mfold program. Results: According to homozygosity mapping and confirmed clinical evi dences such as goiter, vestibular aqueduct enlargement and positive per chlorate discharge test, we report a novel alteration in the 3Ã¢ÂÂ²UTR of SLC26A4 gene led to PS. In addition, bioinformatics analysis showed that the intro duced altered allele destabilized RNA structures; although, the Dot matrix analysis of wild type and mutant form of selected sequence has not been showed any difference based on minimum free energy (Ã¢ÂÂG, 21.5). Conclusion: Our data suggest that identified variation might alter mRNA fol ding and it is conceivable that this new alteration can cause PS in the family under study.",2014

The molecular identities of the ge nes which are involved in ROP remain uncertain, although the evidence for a genetic component of this disease is strong. Bevacizumab, known as Avastin, is an angiogenesis inhibitor who belongs to the class of monoclonal antibo dies and it is considered as a possible treatment for patients diagnosed with cancers because it binds selectively to VEGF; some researchers have noticed impressive results in the field of severe ROP by testing it as an alternative remedy to the diode laser photocoagulation (the treatment of choice). The obtaining and characterization of eye drops based on polyurethane microp articles used as a drug delivery system for bevacizumab were the main aims of this research. The microparticles were synthesized using a polyaddition process coupled with a spontaneous emulsification. The microparticlesÃ¢ÂÂ so lutions were characterized by pH, size, and stability measurements; their irritation potential was evaluated on the mice skin by non invasive techni ques (tewametry, mexametry, and corneometry). A drug release study was performed by monitoring the degradation of these polyurethane micropar ticles for three weeks in two different media: simulated body fluid (SBF) and phosphate buffered saline (PBS); the influence of ultrasounds on the degradation of polyurethane microparticles was also evaluated. The re sults suggests the obtaining of a non irritating material, with good stability, which presents a very slow degradation, beneficial for drugs which require low release rates.",2014

Deletions of coding exons and chro mosomal translocations and more recently a deletion of an upstream regula tory region of PITX2 have been described. Our case is a girl aged 13 months who was referred in our Center for Rare Genetic Ophthalmologic Diseases (CARGO) because of unilateral eye anomalies and umbilical malformations, suggesting RS. The examination revealed posterior embryotoxon, irido cor neal adhesions and pupillary anomaly on the right eye. She had redundant periumbilical skin as well as anal anteposition. Sanger sequencing of PITX2 and FOXC1 was normal. CGHarray analysis revealed a de novo 4q25 deletion upstream of PITX2. The deletion involved the upstream non coding region of PITX2, similar to two previously reported RS patients (Volkmann et al. 2011, Reis et al. 2012). The conserved non coding elements upstream the gene were showed to be involved in regulation of pitx2/PITX2 expression in a zebrafish model (Volkmann et al. 2011). Disease causing mutations outside the coding regions have been reported in other diseases, such as deletions of the downstream regulatory region of PAX6 in aniridia (Lauderdale et al. 2000). The identification of this additional case highlights the importance of the loss of the upstream regulatory region in this disease and the impor tance of screening for this type of deletion in RS patients optimizing genetic counseling for this family.

USH is genetically and clinically heterogeneous. At least fifteen loci and eleven genes identified in USH. Us her syndrome is divided into three subtype: type I (USH1); type II (USH2); and type III (USH3). USH2 is the most common form of Usher syndrome, responsible for moderate to severe hearing deficits, retinitis pigmentosa started around or after puberty associated with normal vestibular respon ses. Three loci associated with USH2 have been reported: USH2A (USH2A ), USH2C (GPR98 ), and USH2D (WHRN ). Defects in GPR98 are the cause of Usher syndrome type 2C (USH2C). Here, we report on a consanguineous Iranian family with two affected individuals for whom we identified a no vel mutation in GPR98 (VLGRI ) gene. Methods: After performing homozy gosity mapping using microsatellite (STR) markers,we approached whole exome sequencing (WES) to detect the disease causing mutation of homo zygous regions. To confirm the identified homozygote variant in GPR98 , sanger sequencing has performed in all family members. Consequently we sequenced 100 normal control to ensure detected variant would not be a polymorphism. Results: We identified a new mutation in GPR98 segregating with USH2C in this family. The missense mutation c.10019T>G leading to p. Val3340Gly. Conclusion:This mutation is the second one, which has been reported for USH2C in Iranian population by our group.

Different mutations in these genes lead to the development of distinct cataract phenotypes. The aim of the study was to analyze the GJA3 gene in patients from Bashkortostan Republic affected with congenital cataract. Objective: DNA samples of 40 unrelated patients with isolated form of here ditary congenital cataract from Bashkortostan Republic were analyzed. Methodology: The analysis was performed by direct sequencing of coding regions of the GJA3 gene. Results: Three different nucleotide alterations were detected. In one pa tient of Tatar ethnic origin with zonular form of cataract the deletion ÃÂ.del1126_1139 was detected; one patient of Tatar ethnic origin with zo nular cataract and microcornea carried the missense mutation ÃÂ. 398 G>A (p.

By using next generation sequencing (NGS) in combination with bioinformatic analysis, we aimed to identify the disease causing mutation in a large adRP family of Gypsy origin. Methods: Targeted NGS of 4,813 genes associated with known clinical phenotypes was performed on APEX negative adRP patient using the Tru SightOne Sequencing Panel and MiSeq system of Illumina. Illumina Vari antStudio software was used to filter single nucleotide variants (SNVs) and insertions/deletions (indels). Results: We identified 9,330 SNVs and indels and after applying filtering criteria the numbers of remaining variants (in parentheses) were as fol lows: (i) exclude homozygous changes (5,857); (ii) exclude minor variant frequency <10% (5,846); (iii) keep nonsynonymous changes and splice va riants (2,666); (iv) keep if same variant presents in <1% of the general po pulation (608); (v) exclude dbSNP with minor allele frequency >1% (574); (vi) exclude if allele is present in at least one of 6,500 individuals of the Exo me Variant Server database (527); (vii) disease phenotype consistent with autosomal dominant retinal degeneration (11).

Hearing loss is the most common sensory disorder worldwide which affects 1 of every 500 newborns. At least 50% of cases can be attributed to gene tics, most often resulting in nonsyndromic deafness (70%), which is usually autosomal recessive (80%). Despite the heterogeinity, mutations in GJB2 at DFNB1 locus are the major cause of autosomal recessive nonsyndromic hearing loss (ARNSHL) in many populations, including Iran (20%). The fact that many loci are involved together with the heterogeneity of the status, ne cessitate studying further loci in various Iranian ethnic groups. In this study, after mutation screening of GJB2 and GJB6 , we used homozygosity mapping to identify regions of autozygosity by descent in 23 large pedigrees all ori ginating from a single province of Iran (South Khorasan), using STR markers for STR markers for 7 loci. In our study, four out of the 23 families showed GJB2 mutations. Interestingly heterogeinity within a family were observed, even in large consanguineous pedigrees. GJB6 deletions were not detected. One family showed linkage to DFNB3 and one family showed to be linked to DFNB7/11. The remaining did not show linkage to the studied loci. Our results once again emphasize the heterogeneity of HL among different Iranian ethnic groups .These results could provide further insight into the etiology of HL and may lead to better genetic diagnostics & counseling.",2014

NDI was suspected and molecu lar studies were performed to investigate these clinical problems. Results: Sequencing result showed a total deletion (11535 bp) in APVR2 gene (NG_009645.2:g.5303_16835del) on X chromosome accompanying 7 bp microhomology at the breakpoint. Following microarray analysis reconfir med this complete deletion of APVR2 preserving LCAM1 and ARHGAP4 gene. Conclusions: With sequencing and microarray analysis, we found the novel deletion in AVPR2 causing complete NDI. As shown in this study, molecular diagnosis has several advantages compared with conventional in vivo test. First, patients unable to conserve water may become critically dehydrated in water deprivation test. There are several contraindications of this test, especially in other causes of polydipsia and polyuria such as DM, hypoadre nalism, or CRF. Second, molecular studies can give more detailed informa tion that cannot be provided by conventional tests. In this patient, the sole deletion of APVR2 preserving LCAM1 and ARHGAP4 meant NDI excluding central type. In addition, since APVR2 is completely deleted, it can only be complete NDI, not partial type. Therefore, this study suggests that genetic testing is a safer and more useful laboratory tool than the physiologic test in diagnosing and subtyping NDI.",2014

Methods:74 children with AITD(lot 1), 98 children with IDDM(lot 2) and 80 healthy children were screened for CD. In patients with at least one positive serologic test for CD, intestinal biopsy was per formed. All children underwent HLA typing for DQ2/DQ8.Results:CD preva lence in lot 1 was 7%, in lot 2 was 6% and in control lot was 0%.All child ren diagnosed with CD presented DQ2/DQ8 haplotype.20% of the control subjects associated heterozygous DQ2 alleles. From 69 children with AITD/without CD,3 patients (4%) presented heterozygous DQ2 alleles. From 92 children with IDDM/without CD, 25 patients (27%) associated homo or heterozygous DQ2/DQ8alleles. There were significantly more cases with IDDM withoutCD but with predisposing haplotype for CD(27%) compared to the number of patients with AITD seronegative for CD and with DQ2/DQ8 alleles(4%) p<0,005.Conclusions: Recommending AITD and IDDM as selection parameters for CD screening in asymptomatic children is justified. HLA assessment cannot highlight a significant role of a certain allele in the pathogenesis of autoimmune comorbidity AITD/CD or IDDM/CD. DQ2 and DQ8 alleles are mandatory but insufficient for CD development. The inter vention of environmental factors is very important.

Conclusion The incidence of NPHS2 mutations in romanian children with NS is considerably lower than that among European childern (10 30%). WT1 mutation was present in girl with focal segmental glome rulosclerosis. Therefore screening of WT1 gene in all females with FSGS is necessary. Because NPHS2 R229Q gene mutation was found in all cases of CNS, a screening of this gene in children with CNS in the adjacent counties is required. Further studies with a larger number of patients are needed.

Genome wide association studies have idenÃÂ¬tified genetic variants influ encing the risk of COPD. The aim of this study was to investigate whether IREB2, CHRNA5, CHRNA3, FAM13A and HHIP polymorphisms would be as sociated with COPD susceptibility in Russian populations. Methods: six single nucleotide polymorphisms: rs13180 (IREB2), rs16969968 (CHRNA5), rs1051730, rs6495309 (CHRNA3), rs7671167 (FA M13A), rs13118928 (HHIP) were genotyped in a case control study (511 COPD patients and 508 controls from Russia). To estimate the strength of association, odds ratios were calculated and potential confounding variab les were tested by using logistic regression analysis. Results: Statistical analysis revealed that SNP rs13180 (IREB2) was asso ciated with COPD (P, 0.0004). Analysis showed an association of rs16969968 (CHRNA5) (P,0.0034) and rs1051730 (CHRNA3) (P,0.0015) in additi ve model and the A A G haplotype of rs16969968 (CHRNA5), rs1051730, rs6495309 (CHRNA3) genes polymorphisms (P, 0.0078) with COPD. The relationship between the rs13118928 (HHIP) (P,0.0017 for AG genotype) and COPD risk was found. Significant association with sever COPD were observed for rs13180 (P,0.0009), rs16969968 (P,0.0071), rs1051730 (P,0.0013), rs13118928 (P,0.003) polymorphisms. Early onset COPD (before 40 yrs) were associated with rs13180 (P,0.000001), rs16969968 (P,0.0001), rs1051730 (P,0.0004). The SNP rs13118928 near HHIP locus was significantly associated with pack years of smoking in COPD patients (P, 0.029).

C677T and A1298C polymorphysisms of MTHFR gene elevates plasma homocysteine levels, reduces plasma folic acid levels, and converts gene expression by altering methylation status in genome. These effects enable the MTHFR gene to be associated with multiple diseases such as cardiovascular diseases, cancers, and schizophrenia. The present study looked for a possible association between C677T and A1298C polymorphysisms of the MTHFR gene in diabetic neuropathy de velopment in diabetic patients and healthy volunteers. Thus a study group consisting of 103 diabetic peripheral neuropathy patients diagnosed via electrophysiological examination (ENMG) and a control group of 100 healthy was formed. C677T and A1298C polymorphysisms of MTHFR in the DNA samples were analyzed by pyrosequencing. MTHFR C677T genotype distribution was in study group CC: %43.7, CT: %42.7, TT: %13.6, and in the control group CC: %45.0, CT: 47.0, TT: %8.0 (p>0.05), MTHFR A1298C genotype distribution was in study group AA: %33.0, AC: %46.6, CC: %20.4 and in the control group AA: %43.0, AC: %44.0, CC: %13.0 (p>0.05). ÃÂÃÂ² test was used for statistical analysis and in the study group, the ratio of 2 or more mutant allele was found to be significantly higher compared to the control group (p,0.010). The data obtained from this study supports the view that the increase in the number of mutant alleles in MTHFR gene can increase diabetic neuropathy susceptibility in patients with diabetes.",2014

FMF predominantly affects populations surroun ding the Mediterranean basin including Armenians, Sephardic Jews, Arabs, Turks, Greeks and Italians. The MEFV gene mutations have been detected in the majority of FMF patients. MEFV gene is located on (16p13.3) comprises of 10 exons and encodes a protein of 781 amino acids called pyrin. Pyrin is expressed at high levels in granulocytes, monocytes and dendritic cells. Mutant pyrin cause dysfunction in the inflammasome complex and leads to excessive activation of IL 1ÃÂ². A total of 289 mutations and polymorphisms in the MEFV gene have been reported in Infevers database. Compared to other cities of Turkey, the high est prevalence of FMF is seen in Sivas city (Central Anatolia). Due to the most frequent mutations are M694V, E148Q, M680I (G/C) and V726A in Turkish FMF patients, we screened the mutations of these exons (2 and 10) of the MEFV gene using DNA sequencing method. During our MEFV gene mutation screening among FMF patients, we detected a novel nucleotide change Q97R (c.290A>G; p. Gln97Arg) at exon 2 of MEFV gene that cause of missense amino acid mutation in pyrin protein in a 22 years old female patient with typical FMF criteria. Turkish FMF patients have a unique mutation spectrum together with our novel Q97R mutation. It is very important to detect novel missense mutati ons in order to explain their crucial roles in FMF pathogenesis.",2014

This pathogenic bacterium plays a causative role in the development of chronic gastritis, peptic ulcers, and gastric ade nocarcinoma. There is increasing evidence that the genetic variability of H. pylori have a clinical importance. Several virulence factors of H. pylori have been described, such as cytotoxin associated gene (cagA) and vaculating cy totoxin (vacA). This study aimed to investigate the prevalence of the cagA and vacA genotypes of H. pylori from patients with upper gastrointestinal diseases and the relationship with clinical outcome in Uzbekistan. A total of 72 patients who underwent endoscopy were included in this study. DNA was isolated from gastroduodenal biopsy samples and the presence of cagA and vacA genotypes were determined by PCR. All patients were found to be H. pylori positive. The main virulence strain observed in our cohort was the cagA+ strain identified in 56 patients (77,8%). From the 52 patients with gastritis, 30(57,7%) harbored cagA+ strains and 12(42,3%) were infected with strains that lacked cagA. CagA positivity was observed in 26(86,7%) of patients with peptic ulcer pathology, whereas CagA negativity was ob served in 4(13,3%) of these patients. Four VacA genotypes were found: s1/ m1(25,8%), s1/m2(46,8%), s2/m1(14, 5%), s2/m2(12,9%). Comparative analysis of resulting genotypes showed a high percentage of s1/m2 with a distribution of 72,7% in patients with peptic ulcer pathology (P < 0.05).

22388,"INTRODUCTION: MicroRNA miR 137 is an important regulator of gene ex pression and functions as a tumor suppressor gene. Expression of miR 137 is downregulated in glioblastoma and colorectal cancer (CRC) due to CpG island methylation, however, the role of miR 137 methylation in gastric car cinogenesis remains largely unexplored. AIM &METHODS: The aim of our study was to characterize the epigenetic regulation of miR 137 in gastric carcinogenesis. We determined miR 137 CpG island methylation level in 81 pairs of primary gastric cancer tissues samples (T GC) and corresponding adjacent normal mucosa (N GC), 20 samples of normal gastric mucosa (N) and 23 gastric tissues from patients with chronic/atrophic gastritis ÃÂ± intestinal metaplasia (CG) using bisulfite pyrosequencing and compared to 29 colorectal cancers (T CRC) and corre sponding adjacent normal colonic mucosa (N CRC).RESULTS: We confirmed the higher methylation level of miR 137 promoter in T CRC tissues compared to adjacent normal colonic tissues (p,0.004). In similar fashion, but to a lesser extent, methylation of miR 137 promoter region was observed in T GC tissues compared to adjacent non cancerous tissues (N GC) (p,0.045). When compared to the normal mucosa from con trols and mucosa from patients with gastritis, we found gradual increase in miR 137 methylation (p<0.0001). In subgroup analyses of gastric cancer tissues, miR 137 methylation was more frequent in tumors localized in an trum compared to cardia and corpus (p,0.07).CONCLUSION: MiR 137 methylation is a frequent event in gastric carcino genesis. The gradual increase in miR 137 methylation, as demonstrated for normal mucosa, chronic gastritis and tumour tissues, may be an early event in gastric carcinogenesis.",2014

22390,"Worldwide prevalence of hyperandrogenism varied from 3% to 23%. This wide range of variation is assosiated with difficulties of differential diagno sis between polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and nonclassic congenital adrenal hyperplasia (NCAH). Molecular genetic analysis plays a significant role in this issue, because NCAH is a genetic disorder which developes due to mutations in the CYP21A2 gene. Therefore, our study aimed to investigate the prevalence of CYP21A2 muta tions in women with hyperandrogenism in Uzbekistan. Real time PCR using allele specific primers and TaqMan probes were used to detect eight most frequent CYP21A2 gene mutations in 361 Uzbek women with hyperandro genic symptoms. Our results showed that 11,7% of these women have mutations in the CYP21A2 gene. We found the following spectrum of mu tations: C1994T 71,4%, T999A 9,5%, A/C655G 7,2%, deletion of 8 bp(707 714GAGACTAC) 4,75%, G1683T 4,75% and C89T 2,4%. In the investigated group of women we did not find T1380A and C2108T mutations. C1994T mutation was found to be the most common mutation in our cohort. Women who harbored this mutation had abnormal menstrual cycle and recurrent miscarriages. In conclusion, genetic screening for CYP21A2 gene mutations by means of real time PCR is an effective method for differential diagnosis between polycystic ovary syndrome and nonclassic congenital adrenal hy perplasia at the patients with hyperandrogenic symptoms.",2014

Twin studies have revealed that genetic factors play an important role in physical activity levels. Although the underlying genetic factors are not clearly understood, studies have shown that the LEPR gene is among the candidate genes affecting physical activity level. In our study, we aimed to show the effect of LEPR gene mutations related with the physical activi ty in obese women. In addition, we evaluated the impact of LEPR gene on body composition parameters. Material and Methods: 66 overweight/ obese women were included in our study. Patients were categorized into 3 groups due to physical activity index levels. After the extraction of genomic DNA from buccal cells, LEPR gene regions were amplified by PCR and PCR products were sequenced. Physical activity levels and body composition parameters were calculated by using actical accelerometer and impedance meter, respectively. Results and Discussion: Three reported polymorphis ms, one in exon 6 and two others in intron 7 of the LEPR gene were detected. No relationship between physical activity levels and LEPR was observed. A correlation was found between resting metabolic rate and rs12405556 mu tation.

A bacterium, Helicobacter pylori, is the main cause of ulcers in this area. The genes that encode proinflammatory and anti inflammatory cytokines are good candidate markers of host susceptibility to gastroduodenal disease. The present study was performed to evaluate association and gene gene interaction of polymorphisms of cytokines genes IL1B (rs1143634), IL1RN (rs71941886), IL8 (rs4073), IL10 (rs1800872) and TNFA (rs1800629) for PUD in Volga Ural region of Russia. This study enrolled 264 patients with gastric and duodenal ulcers (112 in dividual were H.pylori infected), the control group included 277 unrelated individuals without gastro duodenal pathology with different ethnic origins (Russians, Tatars, Bashkirs). Genotyping was performed by PCR RFLP ana lysis. To investigate gene gene interactions, we employed generalized mul tifactor dimensionality reduction (GMDR) method. The analysis has revealed a strong association of C allele and CC genotype of the rs1143634 of the IL1B gene with PUD in Bashkirs (ÃÂ2,7,61, p,0,006; OR,2,87 ÃÂ¸ ÃÂ2,9,28, p,0,002; OR,4,49; 95%CI 1,78 11,35), confirmed by meta analysis.

Association with the disea se was obtained for the following genetic markers: MMP3 rs679620 (AA, OR,2,03 (95% CI: 1,19 3,47), p,0,008), ITGA4 rs1143674 (GG, OR,2,03 (1,27 3,26), p,0,003; allele G, OR,1,68 (1,24 2,27), p,0,001), ITGB5 rs1007856 (TT , OR,1,67 (1,10 2,54), p,0,015; allele T , OR,1,31 (1,02 1,70), p,0,037), ADAMDEC1 rs3765124 (AA, OR,1,76 (1,18 2,65), p,0,005; allele A, OR,1,31 (1,01 1,70), p,0,040), LIG1 rs20579 (CC, OR,1,95 1,26 3,02), p,0,002; allele C, OR,1,91 (1,29 2,81), p,0,001). The MMP3, ITGB5, ITGA4 and ADAMDEC1 genes are involved in the formation of extracellular matrix and collagen metabolism. These associations can be explained by the parti cipation of these genes in the formation of fibrotic changes in the renal tu bules and interstitium, which leads to progression of diabetic nephropathy and deterioration of the patient condition. The LIG1 gene is involved in DNA repair and recombination. Perhaps this gene is associated with type 1 dia betes through some basic metabolic pathway. Altogether, our results suggest that T1DM development is influenced by genes involved into fibrogenesis.",2014

Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is characterized by both insulin resistance (poor tissue insulin sensitivity) and impaired insulin secretion from the pancreatic ÃÂ² cell. Global prevalence of type 2 diabetes is increasing rapid ly. Substantial evidence suggests that T2D is a multifactorial disease with a strong genetic component. Nesfatin 1, derived from the nucleobindin2 (NUCB2) precursor, was recently implicated as a mediator of anorexia in the central nervous system. Plasma nesfatin 1 concentrations were found to be elevated in subjects with both Impaired Glucose Tolerance (IGT) and newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes (nT2DM) and to be related with several clinical parameters known to be associated with insulin resistance. The aim of the present study is to investigate the association of polymorphisms of promo ter of nucb2 gene in Iranian population. We performed a case control study consisted of 100 T2DM and 100 healthy individuals. Blood samples were obtained from subjects after informed con sent was achieved.

22402,"Introduction Liver inherited diseases are a group of genetically determined clinical entities that appear with an early chronic liver involvement. They include WilsonÃ¢ÂÂs disease (WD), hereditary haemochromatosis, and alpha 1 antitrypsin deficiency. In addition, cystic fibrosis may cause a severe liver involvement in a significant percentage of cases. Mutations in the genes HFE, SERPINA1, CFTR could modify the pathogenesis and clinical appearance of WilsonÃ¢ÂÂs disease. Aim To detect frequency of the most common mutations causing inherited liver disorders mentioned above in patients with WD sug gestive symptoms. Material and methods The study included 115 patients with WD suggestive symptoms and 295 unrelated healthy individuals. DNA analysis: both groups were tested for mutation C282Y and H63D in the gene HFE; F508del in the gene CFTR ; PIZ and PIS in the gene SERPINA1. Results Frequency of different alleles: allele F508del in WD patients 0.009, in con trol population 0.01 (p,0.446); PIZ in WD patients 0, in control group 0.018 (p,0.058); PIS in WD patients 0.019, in control group 0 (p,0.045); C282Y in WD patients 0.02, in control group 0.035 (p,0.475); H63D in WD patients 0.188, in control group 0.121 (p,0.019; OR,1.687). Con clusions 1) Alleles PIS and H63D were more frequent in patients with WD suggestive symptoms that could indicate its significance in more severe and better detectable liver disorder in case of WD. 2) But still the role of iron overload and alpha 1 antitrypsin deficiency in the pathogenesis of Wilson disease is not finally elucidated.",2014
22403,"Background: Presently, a number of young males affected by end stage renal disease (ESRD) of unknown causes have been registered for renal replacement therapy. Either genetic or environmental causes cannot be ex cluded. However, search for monogenic causes is challenging since genetic screening can give the information regarding the approach to other patientÃ¢ÂÂs family members such as carrier screening. X linked Alport syndrome (XLAS) is one of the suspected monogenic causes in young male patients. This par ticular syndrome is collagen IV related nephropathy caused by the mutation of COL4A5 on Xq22. Approximately 80% of XLAS leads to end stage renal di sease by the age of 40 with variable association with sensorineural hearing loss and ocular abnormalities. Objective: To characterize COL4A5 mutation in Thai male patients affected by ESRD of unknown causes and to develop the rapid and efficient molecular testing strategies for identifying XLAS in clinical practice. Methodology: DNA extraction was performed from pe ripheral blood leukocytes of Thai male patients, age 10 40 years, affected by ESRD of unidentifiable causes. Three common mutations of COL4A5, C1564S, L1649R, R1677Q, were detected using qPCR and melting curve ana lysis. Results: Twenty patients were recruited in the study. Of them, COL4A5 mutation was detected in four patients (20%). C1564S is the most prevalent ABSTRACTS PUBLISHED ABSTRACTS ESHG 2014 | MILAN, ITALY | WWW. ESHG. ORG 398Back to inde x in this group. Conclusion: XLAS is the hidden cause of ESRD in young male patients affected by ESRD.

22404,"Background: HHT affects approximately 1 in 5000 people and has been as sociated with mutations in ENG, ACVRL1 and SMAD4. Features of this disea se are epistaxis, telengectasia, a family history and visceral arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). International guidelines on the screening of patients with HHT were published in 2011.Method: Patients with HHT were identified using the Molecular Laboratory database at St MaryÃ¢ÂÂs Hospital, Manchester. Screening on mutation positive patients was audited against the International guidelines. Results: 54 patients were identified and 35 (65%) were found to have a mu tation in either ENG or ACVRL1. Pulmonary and cerebral AVM screening was undertaken in 92% and 62% of patients respectively. Screening for anaemia in those over 35 years was undertaken in 21%. 2/19 (11%) eligible pati ents were tested for SMAD4 mutations (both negative). AVMs occurred in 29% ENG and 21% ACVRL1 patients. Lung AVMs were more common in the ENG group (24% vs 7%). One cerebral AVM was identified and this occurred in the ENG group. Liver AVMs only occurred in the ACVRL1 group (21% vs 0%). Overall, AVMs occurred more frequently in women than in men (38% vs 7%).Conclusion: A consensus on screening for HHT patients is needed in the UK. It is globally accepted that screening for pulmonary AVMs and anaemia should be undertaken but cerebral screening is still controversial. SMAD4 mutations should be sought in those patients who are negative for ENG and ACVRL1. The breakdown of AVMs in this population adds further evidence to a genotype phenotype correlation in HHT .",2014

These mutations are found throughout the entire gene and cause a wide spectrum of clinical severity. Rare in Eu rope, PH1 is responsible for 13% of the end stage renal failure in the Tuni sian child. In the present work, we identified the double mutation c.32C>T (Pro11Leu) and c.731T>C (p. Ile244Thr) in AGXT gene in five unrelated Tu nisian families with PH1 disease. Our results provide evidence regarding the potential involvement of c.32C>T , originally described as common polymor phism, on the resulting phenotype. We also reported an extreme intrafami lial heterogeneity in clinical presentation of PH1. Despite the same genetic background, the outcome of the affected members differs widely. The signi ficant phenotypic heterogeneity observed within a same family, with a same genotype, suggests the existence of relevant modifier factors.",2014
22406,"3M syndrome is a rare autosomal recessive disease characterized by severe prenatal and postnatal growth retardation, facial dysmophism, unaffected intelligence and normal endocrine profile. Mutations are reported in three genes. CUL7 is the major gene responsible for the 3M syndrome accounting for 70% of cases. This work aims to establish the molecular diagnosis of 3M syndrome by detecting the presence of a founder mutation, previously reported among Maghrebian patients, in exon 24 of the gene CUL7 of five Tunisian patients with the typical features of the 3M syndrome. If the foun der mutation is not detected, the molecular diagnosis of hotspots in exons 4 and 19 of CUL7 gene will be performed. Following the extraction of genomic DNA from peripheral blood sample, after parental consent, we performed a PCR amplification step followed by analysis by direct sequencing of the co ding regions of exons 4, 18, 19, 24 and 25 of CUL7gene. Using these methods, we confirmed the presence of the founder mutation, del TG 4451 4452, in three of our patients . Furthermore, we did not detect either mutation or polymorphism in the five targeted exons of CUL7 gene in the index case of a second family that encloses two 3M patients. 3M syndrome is characterized by genetic heterogeneity that contrasts with the clinical homogeneity of the syndrome. We plan to complete the molecular diagnosis in the other exons of the major gene CUL7 before switching to the other two genes (OBSL1 and CCDC8) for cases of the family 02.",2014

The predisposition of AS disease is higher in HLA B*27 positive people than HLA B*27 negative ones. Also, there are some pa tients who have both AS disease and MEFV gene mutation. In our study, as sociation of MEFV gene mutations have been analysed in HLA B*27 positive and negative patients who diagnosed as AS, and HLA B*27 negative healthy controls. 80 patients including HLA B*27 positive 36 male and 14 female AS patients, HLA B*27 negative 11 female and 19 male AS patients have been studied in the research. 50 healthy controls including 17 female and 33 male HLA B*27 negative healthy individuals have been studied. HLA B*27 allele of both patient and control groups were determined by PCR SSP method. Pyrosequencing method was used for detection of MEFV gene mutations.

Mutations in the filaggrin gene (FLG), a key component of stratum corneum, have been identified as a strong pre disposing factor for allergic diseases. In this study, we have screened three FLG loss of function mutations (c.2282del4, p. Arg501X and p. Arg2447X) in AD patients and controls. The AD group consisted of 448 AD patients (177 Russians, 126 Tatars, 145 individuals of mixed ethnic background). The control group included 408 non atopic individuals (152 Russians, 109 Tatars and 147 individuals of mixed origin). Genomic DNA was isolated by phenol chloroform extraction. The genotyping of SNPs was performed by PCR RFLP . In our study the most prevalent FLG mutation was c.2282del4. The allelic frequency in AD patients was 6.61% in general group, 6.03% in Russians (p,2,3*10 4) and 9.35% in Tatars (p,1,6*10 5). In controls the frequency of c.2282del4 was significantly lower: 1.12% in total group, 0.97% in Russians and 0.46% in Tatars. Second mutation p. Arg501X in our groups was rarely found.

Fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva (FOP) is a rare autosomal dominant disease with a prevalence of approximately 1 in 2 million worldwide. FOP is characterized by the presence of malformations of the big toes and of postnatal progressive heterotopic endochondral osteogenesis, especially in the presence of exacerbating factors such as trauma, surgical intervention, lesion biopsy, and intramuscular injection. FOP has been associated with a specific mutation on ACVR1 (c.617G>A; p. Arg206His), which encodes a re ceptor for bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs). Our aim was to establish the molecular diagnosis by mutation screening of ACVR1. We report a male patient with progressive ossificans since childhood, showing calcification of the axial line with inability to perform flexion and extension of the scapular and pelvic girdle with neck stiffness. Surgical intervention in adolescence resulted in disease progression. At the moment, patient is bedridden and with partial jaw fixation. Mutation screening was performed by PCR ampli fication of all coding and flanking regions, followed by bidirectional direct sequencing. We have found one missense mutation in exon 6 (c.617G>A; p.

Leri Weill dyschondrosteosis (LWD; #MIM 127300) is an autosomal domi nant hereditary disease, which is characterized by short stature, mesome lic shortening of the limbs, and characteristic bilateral abnormality of the wrists known as Madelung deformity. LWD is caused by mutations in the Short Stature Homeobox gene (SHOX). The other diseases which are asso ciated with SHOX gene mutations are Langer Mesomelic Dysplasia (LMD, MIM #249700) and Turner syndrome as well as nonsyndromic idiopathic short stature (ISS). The SHOX gene is localized within the pseudoautosomal region 1 (PAR1) of the X and Y chromosomes. Both alleles of SHOX gene must be functional for normal growth. While heterozygous mutations of SHOX gene or its enhancer regions are responsible for both LWD and ISS syndromes, LMD is caused by homozygous or compound heterozygous mu tations in this gene. Herein, four LMD and one LWD siblings and their con sanguineous parents with LWD are presented. Mutation analysis revealed that the parents and one sibling were heterozygous, and the other 4 siblings were homozygous for the c.42delG (p. Q14QfsX15) in the SHOX gene.",2014

Background: This project aims at the development of assays for detection of mutations in structural proteins. Both intracellular (cytoskeleton and nucle oskeleton) and extracellular proteins (extracellular matrix) are considered, as well as non structural proteins which are closely functionally associated with these structural proteins. Mutations in the selected proteins are known to cause rare diseases (RD). The project resonates with current clinical need to improve diagnostics and prognostics of rare diseases as formulated in many running national and European programs (e.g. Czech National Action Plan for Rare Diseases, COST NANONET , ORPHANET , EURORDIS, ERNDIM, EUROCAT , ICBDSR, E rare ERA). Methods: The main detection method cho sen is the scanning high resolution melting analysis. The primers were desi gned for 65 subselected genes. The amplicons are succesively optimized to fit maximally two major PCR/HRM conditions for each gene. The following assays have been technically finalized on control DNA and both major te sted platforms (LightScanner 96 and LightCycler 480): LMNA, MYH7, DMD, ACTC1, MYH6, MYL2, MYL3, DES, MYLK2, MYH14, MYH9 and MYO6. LMNA, MYH7 and DMD is currently undergoing testing on positive patient and syn thetic DNA samples. Results: Female patient, 35 years old, with suspected Emery Dreifuss muscular dystrophy was scanned using the LMNA scHRM assay. The scanning revealed putative mutation in the exon 6 of the LMNA gene which was confirme by the Sanger sequencing. Additional reported cases with mutations in the DMD and MYH7 genes will follow.

We studied a case referred for unusual atrophic skin patches on the buttocks. Histopathology and electron microscopy demonstrated mar kedly abnormal elastic fibers. Consequent medical genetics evaluation led ultimately to the diagnosis of MASS phenotype, and to the discovery of an underlying FBN1 mutation.

Here in, we present a family with novel COL9A3 gene mutation. Case : The proband was a 12 year old boy born from non consanguineous parents. He was referred to the pediatric orthopedic clinic for the evaluation of intermittent knee pain that occurred from a few months. The radiogra phic phenotype of COL9 MED is that the epiphysis of the distal tibia, distal radius and distal ulnae showed lateral shortening, wedge shape and small, respectively. Direct sequencing of COL9 MED associated genes was perfor med and identified a novel mutation c.104G>A in exon 2 of COL9A3 , which resulted in p. Gly35Asp. The same mutation was observed in the probandÃ¢ÂÂs father. The molecular dynamics (MD) simulation of wild type and mutant model structure were performed using AMBER11 program and demon strated that the mutant type collagen was aggregated by themselves while wild type structure formed hydrogen bonds with its neighboring strand. In addition, the distances between the mutation site of the wild type and the mutant collagen are almost twice. The calculated energy state of the mutant is much lower, causing a self aggregation.

Mutations in the low density lipoprotein receptor related protein 5 (LRP5) gene cause rare syndromes characterized by altered bone mineral densi ty (BMD). LRP 5 is a transmembrane protein encoded by gene located in 6q25.1. LRP 5 protein takes part in a proliferation and differentiation of osteoblasts via Wnt signaling. The Wnt/b catenin signaling pathway stimu lates bone formation through a number of mechanisms such as stimulation of preosteoblast replication, induction of osteoblastogenesis, and inhibition of osteoblast and osteocyte apoptosis. LRP 5 is widely expressed in most human tissues, with greater amounts in the liver and pancreas. In bone, it is mainly expressed by the bone forming cells as osteoblasts, in the endosteal and trabecular bone surfaces. Common LRP5 variants were associated with the osteoporosis risk in males. The aim of this pilot study was to analyze occurrence of polymorphic variant c.2074G>A (p.

Therefore, the present study aimed to investigate the potential influence of the PROGINS haplotype on the SLE onset and clinical manife stations. Materials and methods: The PROGINS Alu insertion polymorphism was investigated in 122 Caucasian lupus patients and 105 healthy controls by PCR RFLP analysis. Results: PROGINS variant allele (Alu ins) was found in 15.20% of the participants. No significant differences in the genotype fre quencies of progesterone receptor PROGINS polymorphism in patients and controls were observed, although the prevalence of Alu ins/Alu ins genotype was more common in controls than in patients (4.76% vs. 0.82%, p,0.182).

Osteoprotegerin (OPG) is a recently discovered member of the TNF receptor superfamily that acts as important paracrine regulator of bone remodeling. In the present study, we screened rs2073618 polymorphism in the OPG exon 1. Study group included 200 post menopausal women diagnosed as osteoporotic by clinicians based on clinical features and radiological evidence. Control group included 200 post menopausal non osteoporotic women. Genotyping for the presence of rs2073618 polymorphism was performed using the Custom TaqmanÃÂ®SNP Genotyping assays. The frequencies of investigated genotypes for rs2073618 polymorphism in the group of patients with osteoporosis were as follows: GG (21.0%), GA (56.5%), CC (22.5%), the distribution in control groups was: GG (24.0%), GA (56.0%), CC (20.0%). Hardy Weinberg equilibrium was te sted for each group of participants using ÃÂ2 test. All statistical analyses were performed with SPSS 16.0. No differences in genotype or allele frequencies in OPG gene rs2073618 polymorphism between patients with osteoporo sis and control subjects were found (ÃÂ2,0.69, p,0.405; ÃÂ2,0.61, p,0.436). Further studies are necessary for obtaining of more reliable results on the larger population for clarification molecular mechanisms with practical use in everyday practice.

22441,"Trichothiodystrophy (TTD) is rare autosomal recessive disease that affects DNA repair mechanism. TTD demonstrate great variability in severity and clinical involvement of different tissues and organs skin and hair, bones, gonads, brain. Several attempts are made to classify TTD, according photo sensitivity, age of onset and, more recently, genetic findings. We report on a female patient with severe form of TTD. She is the first child in a family. The baby was delivered in 33 week of pregnancy and had low birthweight and poor accommodation during perinatal period due to the breeding and swallowing difficulties. Ichtiosis was present from the begin ning, ranging from dry skin, scaling to freckling in different parts of the body. Photosensitivity was not clinically evident. Trichorexis and dystrophic nails were present, as well as typical facial appearance. Short stature and develop mental milestones were noticed after the second year. Axial osteosclerosis started from her fifth year initially discovered with X ray and densitometry, afterwards progressing rapidly and at the age of 9 year she experienced pro found walking difficulties. DNA repair synthesis was moderately affected. A heterozygous mutation in ERCC2 gene was found Y339X, 1017C>G and R722W, 2164C>T .Patients with TTD have altered production of transcription factor II, due to the mutation in one of the three subunits: ERCC2, ERCC3 and GTF2H5. Osseous anomalies were seen in 20% of TTD cases and are often undescri bed. Although reported to give a severe clinical presentation, disease spe cific causative allele R722W was rarely associated with the appearance of osteosclerosis.",2014

It divides on several types the main of which are lamellar ichthyosis (LI) and nonbullous congenital ichthyosiform ery throderma (NCIE), although phenotypic overlap within the same patient or among patients from the same family. Mutation in several genes can lead to both LI and NCIE. We analyzed DNA samples from 11 patients with LI and 8 patients with NCIE on mutations in Alox12B gene. We found mutations in DNA from 11 patients (6 with LI and 5 with NCIE). One mutation Ala597Glu in exon 14 occurs on 11 chromosomes in 8 families: 3 in homozygous state and 5 in heterozygous state.

We aimed to study mutations in CR TAP , LEPRE1, PPIB and SERPINF1 genes in OI patients. We examined 78 pa tients with OI and 100 healthy controls corresponding by age, gender, ethni city and place of residence. We sequenced the coding and exon flanking regi ons of CRTAP , LEPRE1, PPIB and SERPINF1 genes. We identified two distinct heterozygous mutations, undescribed before. For the first time previously unreported splicing mutation c.1724+4G>A in LEPRE1 gene was identified in one patient from Tatar population and the ÃÂ.913C>G (p.

22445,"Congenital joint dislocations are caused by structural abnormalities in joint development. The differential diagnosis is broad and involves recessive Larsen syndrome, diastrophic dysplasia, gPAPP deficieny and some others. Molecular studies have revealed several gene defects in proteoglycan bio synthetic pathway and have highlighted the importance of proteoglycans in the joint development. Loss of function mutations have been identified in the chondroitin sulfate synthase 1 (CHSY1; MIM 608183) gene which encodes a key protein in glycosaminoglycans biosynthesis and a secreted FRINGE enzyme required for NOTCH signalling to cause Temtamy Preaxial Brachydactyly syndrome (TPBS, MIM 605282). Congenital joint dislocations have not been reported in association with CHSY1 gene mutations so far. We here present the first clinical report on two siblings with TPBS carrying a novel homozygous CHSY1 mutation in whom one of the sibs had bilate ral complete anterior knee and unilateral hip dislocations in addition.

PNPLA1 has recently been identified as one of the eight genes (ALOX12B, ALOXE3, CERS3, CYP4F22, NIPAL4 or TGM1) in which mutations can cause autosomal recessive congenital ichthyosis (ARCI), although only two fami lies harbouring such mutations (both of North African origin) have been identified. In a study of ALOX12B, ALOXE3, CYP4F22, NIPAL4 and TGM1 performed in 17 ARCI families in Galicia (NW Spain), about 80% of these families had mutant TGM1 or ALOXE3, while no mutations of NIPAL4, CYP4F22 or ALO X12B were found. In 2012 a new locus of ARCI mutations, in PNPLA1, was published and we accordingly investigated the prevalence of PNPLA1 mutations in our series of 18 ARCI families, which constitute 95% of the 19 Galician ARCI families identified to date. Four Galician families known to have no deleterious mu tations of ALOX12B, ALOXE3, CYP4F22, NIPAL4 or TGM1 were studied. The potential pathogenic effect of the variant identified was evaluated using the programs Align GVGD, MAPP , PolyPhen and SIFT . One consanguineous fami ly was found to harbour the missense substitution c.100G>A (p. Ala34Thr), located in the catalytic domain of PNPLA1. Cosegregation analysis indica ting the deleterious nature of this variant was supported by the bioinfor matic predictions. We have identified the third known ARCI family with PNPLA1 mutations, and the first of European ancestry. Although mutant PNPLA1 was found in about 6% of our Galician ARCI series, the small number of Galician ARCI families prevents us from generalizing this figure.

22447,"The ATP binding cassette transporter A1, ABCA1, is a ROR Alpha target gene that participates in the removal of cholesterol from lipid laden ma crophages, a crucial anti atherogenic mechanism. Statins are currently the most efficacious therapy for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia and car diovascular diseases. Some studies have shown that statins decrease ABCA1 expression and choleterol efflux from human macrophages. However, other studies have reported no change, or even a modest increase in this variables. In this study our aim was to investigate the ABCA1 expression and apolipo protein AI (apoAI) mediated cholesterol efflux after simvastatin treatment in THP 1 macrophages. Cholesterol is one known ligand of ROR Alpha and is important in cardiovascular diseases like atherosclerosis. Thus, we further explored the effect of simvastatin on activation of the ROR Alpha in human macrophages by studying the influence of cellular cholesterol efflux. We ob served that simvastatin repressed the expression of ABCA1 gene, and that this repression was partially prevented by ROR Alpha ligands (especially by SR1001). Furthermore, ligand induced activation of ROR Alpha by CPG 52608 and SR 1001 increased apoAI mediated cholesterol efflux in THP 1 macrophages. In conclusion, activation of ROR Alpha not only increased AB CA1 expression and cholesterol efflux in the absence of simvastatin, but also restored these functions in the presence of simvastatin. With the demon stration of the ABCA1 that involve in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis might be controlled by an inducible transcription factor, this study offers a potential therapeutic treatment for the disease.",2014
22448,"Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is an irreversible and progressive dila tation of the abdominal aorta. Known risk factors for AAA include smoking, male sex, increasing age, and family history, but no genetic markers have clearly been shown to be responsible for this pathology. In order to assess the potential role of genetic rearrangements in the pa thogenesis of AAA, we analyzed a cohort of 50 patients who had undergone surgical repair of AAA. DNA from peripheral blood and AAA wall specimens of each patient was analyzed by CGH array. A common deletion region on chromosome Xp22 was found in about half of AAA wall specimens and never in the corresponding peripheral blood. In order to demarcate the bounda ries of the identified deleted region, a real time PCR was performed on some genes located within the deleted region: SHOX, CRFL2 and DHRSX. Specifi cally, samples deleted for SHOX, CLRF2 and DHRSX genes represented 41.8, 28 and 32.5% respectively. These results allowed us to identify for the first time a common deletion region on chromosome Xp22 link to abdominal aortic aneurysm using CGH array technology. Future characterization of the involved genes within the deleted region may contribute to define the molecular mechanisms involved in the structural alteration of vascular wall tissue and predisposing to abdo minal aortic dilatation.",2014

Maria Nuova Istituto di Ricovero e Cura a Carattere Scientifico, Reggio Emilia, Italy. Bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) is a common congenital heart defect, occurring in 0,5% to 2% of the population. Its clinical presentation is heterogeneous, but associated dilatation of the ascending aorta is often present. Familial studies showed that BAV with or without thoracic aortic aneurysm (TAA) segregates in an autosomal dominant manner with incomplete penetran ce and variable expression, likely underlying a single common gene defect. Even if mutations in NOTCH1 and rarely in GATA5 and TGFBR2 have been linked to BAV+/ TAA, its molecular basis in most families remains unknown. Mutations in ACTA2 have been reported as major cause of familiar TAA (up to 14%), with associated BAV in some individuals. We recruited 20 patients who underwent surgery for BAV and TAA to inve stigate the possible role of ACTA2 mutations in their phenotype, to evaluate possible common clinical signs correlating with the cardiovascular patho logy, to determine the prevalence of familiarity of BAV+/ TAA (performing echocardiography in first degree relatives).We did not identify ACTA2 mutations in our probands, nor common clinical signs possibly related to their heart disease. Furthermore, we found that the phenotype BAV+/ TAA segregates in 25% of our families, in accordance to literature data. Although our cohort is small, we conclude that ACTA2 does not seem to contribute significantly to the common phenotype of BAV+/ TAA, and that cardiac ultrasound screening is important in probandsÃ¢ÂÂ re latives.",2014

Here, we report dysmorphic features of two unrelated Tunisian; BRAF mutated children and discuss dif ficulties of genetic counselling in our environment. The first case (P1) and second case are 7 years old girls born to distant consanguineous parents from Bir Ali Ben Khalifa and no consanguineous parents from Sidi Bouzid, respectively. Pregnancies were complicated by hydroamniosis. P1 had a con genital severe valvular pulmonic stenosis detected immediately after birth, treated 4 years later but with a failed valve repair. P2 had hypertrophic car diomyopathy detected 6 months after birth without any familial history of congenital heart diseases.

22451,"Background: Cardiac channelopathies are responsible for approximately 15% of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) and 9% of intrauterine fetal demise (IUFD). Recently, mutations in two genes encoding the calcium bin ding protein calmodulin (CALM1 and 2), have been associated with recur rent cardiac arrest in infants with Long QT Syndrome, Catecholaminergic Polymorphic Ventricular Tachycardia and Idiopathic Ventricular Fibrilla tion. Calmodulin mutations disrupt Ca2+ signalling in the heart, affecting membrane ion channelsÃ¢ÂÂ function and kinase mediated signal transduction. Given the life threatening arrhythmias described in infants, it seemed logi cal to expect that calmodulin could play a role in SIDS and in IUFD. Methods: Genomic DNA was extracted from frozen tissue. All three genes encoding calmodulin (CALM1 2 3) were analysed with Sanger sequencing in a cohort of SIDS cases (n,46) and in a population of IUFD (n,44; gesta tional age at death >,20 weeks) classified as Ã¢ÂÂunexplainedÃ¢ÂÂ after a post mortem evaluation. Results: Mutational analysis of the 3 CALM genes did not identify any pa thogenic variant. In addition, the CALM3 rs115265989 polymorphism (NM_005184.2:c.267G>A) was identified in one Black IUFD case, and is pre sent in 1% of subjects of the Exome Sequencing Project Black population. Conclusions: Surprisingly, even though calmodulin mutations have been de scribed in severe and early onset cardiac arrhythmic syndromes, no genetic variants were identified in our SIDS and IUFD populations. These data sug gest that calmodulin mutations are not a major cause of SIDS and IUFD. Pos sible explanations include a combination of rarity of calmodulin mutations and small sample size of the population analysed.",2014

Recently mitochondrial DNA mutations have been associated with cardiomyopathies. Mitochondria are the major site of energy produc tion in the cell. Thus it is reasonable to assume that energy dependant tissu es such as heart, brain, skeletal muscle and endocrine system are affected by mitochondrial dysfunction. Many mitochondrial diseases arise form defects of the mitochondrial respiratory chain. mitochondrial disorders have ma ternal inheritance pattern. The mtDNA mutation rate is much higher than nuclear DNA due to lack of a repair mechanism and also having no intron. Recent studies have reported maternally inherited, non x linked HCMs are associated with defects in mitochondrial oxidative metabolism. Methods: In this study we screened 52 Iranian hypertrophic cardiomyopathyÃ¢ÂÂs pati ents for mitochondrial DNA deletions. Results: Mitochondrial DNA deletions were detected by PCR using 6 paired primers. Five different deletions were found in 29 patients (55.8%). Eighteen patients (34.4%) showed 8.5 kb deletion. Twelve (23%) patients had 9 kb deletion. Seven patients (13.4%) had a 7.3 kb deletion. Eight patients (15.5%) had 4977 bp common deletion between nt8161 nt13640, and 11 patients had 7.4 kb deletion. Multiple de letions have been found in 11 patients (21.1%). Conclusion: Mitochondrial DNA deletions may occur as a result of aging; on the other hand mt deletions may affect myocardium and lead to secondary hypertrophy.

Introduction: Ischaemic stroke is one of the leading causes of disability and death in Romania. Platelets play a key role in generating the protective he mostatic plug that prevents blood loss at sites of vascular injury. The identi fication of functional prothrombotic polymorphisms during the past decade encouraged the study of common polymorphisms affecting platelet glycopro teins (GP) in stroke. The aim of the present study is to evaluate the relation ship between PIA/PIA2 Glycoprotein IIIa gene polymorphism and ischemic stroke in a Northern Romanian population group and to determine whether it has an influence on the risk of cerebral events. This is a cross sectional, randomized, case control study for the evaluation of PIA/PIA2 Glycoprote in IIIa gene polymorphism alleles frequency among patients with ischemic stroke. Material and method: The study included 131 patients diagnosed with ische mic stroke (neurological and CT scan examination), and 110 healthy unrela ted controls. PIA/PIA2 Glycoprotein IIIa genotyping was carried out using PCR RFLP technique. The amplification of the relevant gene fragment was subjected to restriction enzyme digestion, followed by gel electrophoresis. Results: Molecular analysis did not reveal an increased frequency of A1A2 mutant genotype in the study group compared to the control group (p , 1.000, OR , 0,951, CI , 0.504 1.797).Conclusions: We found no significant differences in distribution of the PIA/PIA2 Glycoprotein IIIa gene polymorphism between ischemic stroke patients and controls.",2014

Significantly (P<0,05) higher frequency of IL8 781T allele carriers in case group (81,6%) comparing to control (70,1%) was revealed. 781C allele carriers have 2 fold increased AIS development risk (OR,1,886; 95% CI: 1,041 3,417). Significantly (P<0,05) higher fre quency of IL10 gene 592C allele carriers was observed in patients with AIS (98,2%) comparing to control (90,7%). AIS development risk in such indi viduals is 5 fold increased (OR,5,71; 95% CI: 1.48 22.11). These genotypes may result in aberrant initial inflammatory ischemia response. Genotype role in post stroke improvement (state severity assessed using RANKIN scale on 3rd and 14th treatment day) was evaluated. 592C allele homozy gotes have more than 2 fold higher improvement chances during the first fortnight of treatment (OR,2,76; 95% CI: 1.26 6.07). Pro inflammatory cy tokines induce expression of inflammation specific molecules, and cerebral infarction zone expands. High levels of anti inflammatory IL 10 may pre vent from this outspread.

Protein C, Protein S, antiphospholipid antibodies, lupus anticoagulant, Factor V Leiden mutation, F2G20210A and F12C46T were normal. Results: The results showed a heterozygous pattern of AT Cambridge mutation. However, sequencing analysis revealed a new genetic variant within exon 6 of the SERPINC1 gene, A13264T . This variant is a synonymous mutation and causes a codon change (GCA ÃÂ GCT) but does not alter the sequence of the gene product of residue Ala382. Conclusions: This new synonymous mutation Ala382Ala was not detected in 100 healthy control subjects, suggesting that it is a rare nucleotide variation.

Aim study was to evaluated the presence of cow`s milk allergy among cystic fibrosis children. Methods: In one year, sixty seven children with cystic fibrosis, aged 1month 3 years (19 infants), followed in our center were observed for CMPA. Cow`s milk allergy was suspected in the presence of specific clinical manifestation( gastrointestinal symptoms, cutaneous signs, respiratory features), in cases with a suggestive medical history( failure to thrive, colics etc). In addition CMPA specific IgE( ÃÂ± andÃÂ² lactoglobulin, casein) and diagnostic elimination test + food challenge test. Results: Among infants, CMPA was diagnosed in 47.36% (9 patients) of children, predominantly in pancreatic insufficient children (77% CF infant with pancreatic insufficiency). Toddlers (1 3 years) were diagnosed in a smaller percent, only 16.6 %( 8 children) proved to have CMPA, although in more than 35% of toddlers, a positive history for CMPA diagnosis was found. Cystic fibrosis patients with pancreatic insufficiency associated more frequently CMPA(88.23%) than cystic fibrosis patients pancreatic sufficient. The prevalence of cow`s milk allergy was important, cumulating a 25.37% of CF patients. Conclusion: Cow`s milk allergy was frequently found in CF children, espe cially associated with pancreatic insufficiency.

Whole exome sequencing (WES) has been recently introduced as an alternative approach to search for alleles underlying Mendelian disorders and has been successfully applied for gene/mutation discovery. In this study, we used WES to identify the pathogenic mutations responsible for NSHL in three families (NSHL6, 11, and 12), with a recessive inheritance pattern and at least two affected siblings. A total of 9 individuals were subjected to WES using the SeqCapEZ Exome capture kit (Roche) and the HiSeq 2000 sequencer (Illumi na). In particular, the NSHL6 patients were compound heterozygous for two novel mutations within the TMPRSS3 gene (DFNB8/10 locus). Both variants segregate with post lingual, bilateral, high frequency NSHL and affect evo lutionary conserved amino acids located within the TMPRSS3 catalytic do main. In the NSHL11 family, two novel missense variants were found in the heterozygous state in OTOGL, a gene that was only recently associated with NSHL (otogelin like protein, DFNB84 locus).

Here we present a no vel mutation in the MUT gene of a 3 years Old Iranian girl with metabolic acidosis. The patient had history of recurrent attacks of severe metabolic acidosis. Tandem mass spectroscopy showed elevated propionyl carnitine (C3) and the urine organic acid analysis confirmed the diagnosis of MMA. She was screened for mutations in the MUT gene. A novel C to G nucleotide change was found in position 3 of the acceptor splice site in intron 12. The hetero zygosity of both parents was confirmed. In order to demonstrate the possible effect of this nucleotide change, an Insilico analysis was done using CBS prediction site (http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/SignalP). This analysis suggested that the reported nucleotide change can create abnormal splicing pattern. To confirm abnormal splicing from the mutant allele, total RNA was ex tracted from patientsÃ¢ÂÂ father peripheral blood. cDNA synthesis was done. Appropriate primers were designed to amplify fragments from the region representing normal and aberrant variants of mRNA. Amplified products were sequenced.

Beside this, we present our results and the utility of this method for rapid diagnosis and monitoring steps for galacto semia and alkaptonuria. The level of excretion of the metabolites in these three IEM has been well within the range of NMR detection. In the critical care setting, IEM that were not diagnosed through the neonatal screening should be considered as cause of acute neurologic, hepatic/ renal decline, rapid diagnosis being essential.

Our results allow to suggest that mutations in lyso somal proteins genes promote alpha synuclein aggregation in LSD.",2014
22500,"Introduction:Glycogen storage disease(GSD) is a metabolism disorder re sulting in glycogen accumulation in hepatocytes and in development of the secondary mitochondrial disfunction. Aim:to evaluate functional activity of lymphocytes mitochondria in children with genetically diagnosed GSD of Ia and Ib type. Materials and methods:23 patients with GSD were examined,9 of them with Ia type,14 with Ib type.34 nominally healthy children composed the control group. The functional activity of mitochondria was estimated by succinatedehydrogenase(SDH) activity, which was identified in the general lymphocytes population, in T lymphocytes,B lymphocytes and Nk cells by flow cytometry method(FC500).Results:In patients with GSD of Ia type there were determined mutations:ÃÂ.247ÃÂ¡>T , c.883C>T of G6PC gene. In patients with Ib GSD, mutations of the gene SLC37A4:ÃÂ.1042_1043delCT , c.345insG, c.411G>A,c.413G>A,c.528delG, as well as mutations non reported before:c.1016G>T(in 3 patients),c.817G>A(in 1 patient) were identified. In all children with I type GSD,decrease of SDH activity in the ge neral lymphocytes population in comparison with the norm was revealed(p<0,02,Kolmogorov Smirnov test).In patients with Ib type, characterized by more severe disease course, there was detected greater decrease of mitochondria functional activity than in children with Ia type(p<0,05).SDH activity analysis in lymphocytes population showed 40% decrease in B cells and 18 % in T lf regarding the norm, with 20 % SDH activity increase in Nk cells and NkT lymphocytes compared with the norm. Conclusions:Disfunctions of mitochondrial apparatus, more prominent in patients with Ib type, were revealed in patients with Ia and Ib GSD. SDH lymphocytes activity analysis may be used as additional diagnostic criterion for evaluation of the condition severity of children with GSD.",2014
22501,"A. Y. Demetevler Oncology Training and Researc, Ankara, Turkey. Acute myeloid leukemia (AML), phenotypically and genotypically is a quite heterogeneous disease. A patient who applied to hematology polyclinic of our hospital with various complaints was diagnosed with AML. Following this, in genetic analyses that were performed, t(8;21) and FLT3 ITD were found as positive. Additionally, in chromosome analysis trisomy 8 was ob served. After remission was ensured in the patient, allogenic stem cell trans plantation was made. By performing t(8;21), FLT3, and trisomy 8 analyses of the patient within regular intervals, it is aimed to provide prior information about relapse and minimal residual disease. In this patient, our follow up parameter for minimal residual disease with RT PCR was t(8;21). FLT3 ITD was our follow up parameter with conventional PCR. Additionally in our pa tient, the chimerism follow up was done in capillary electrophoresis by the analysis of short tandem repeats (STR). From the aspect of MRD follow up, concordant results were obtained from both conventional PCR and RT PCR and also from the capillary electrophoresis. From these three methods the one which has the highest sensitivity is RT PCR, then in the second place ca pillary electrophoresis comes and after that conventional PCR comes. From the point of laboratory since the sensitivities of the methods are different, studying with several methods for the follow up of minimal residual disease might be required. Additionally with this case, it is attempted to emphasize the importance of examination of all chromosomal anomalies along with known gene mutations in newly diagnosed AML patients from the aspect of diagnosis, follow up and prognosis of the patients.",2014
22502,"B cell non Hodgkin lymphomas (B NHL) are generally considered as aggres sive malignancies which originate from of the transformed B cell. BIOMED 2 multiplex PCR has been suggested as a gold standard method for the detec tion of monoclonality in the immune cell system in hemato malignancies and lymphoproliferative disorders. Molecular clonality (assays?) were per forms based on the patterns of gene rearrangements in the immunoglobu lin chains loci. During B cell malignancies, immunoglobulin recombinant constructions are produced exclusively, and are applied as diagnostic bio markers in B NHL. Here, we used the BIOMED 2 protocol to reveal the dia gnostic value of immunoglobulin light chains (IgÃÂº, IgÃÂ») and incomplete IGH D J monoclonal gene rearrangements on FFPE samples. The study was per formed on 70 patients with B NHL which were previously assessed for IGH monoclonality and failure to clarify rearrangements. Our results revealed positive clonality in 62 out of 70 (~89%) cases in the IgÃÂº and IgÃÂ» analysis. The samples with positive clonality included 41.4% for IgÃÂ» and 47.2% for IgÃÂº. However, our investigation on FFPE tissue revealed that EuroClonality BIOMED 2 protocols could be considered as a valuable and reliable method for clonality detection especially in failure of the IGH analysis. In general, clonal Ig gene rearrangement assays are applicable for the diagnosis of lym phoproliferative disorders and are a distinguishable method for differentia ting between malignant and benign lymphoma disorders. Furthermore, we are able to implement the BIOMED 2 protocol as a routine diagnostic tool for hemato malignancies.",2014

Lymphomas are mostly characterized as clonal prolifÃÂ¬erations of specific tumour cells. Routinely, the detection of malignant lymphomas are largely evaluated by their morphological features, immunohistochemistry and flow cytometric imÃÂ¬munophenotyping. However, these conventional methods cannot be relied upon to distinguish between certain types of lymphomas. BIOMED 2 multiplex PCR has been suggested as a gold standard method for differentiating between malignant and benign lymphoma disorders. Here, we used BIOMED 2 protocols to determine the clonality of IGH gene arran gement in patients with lymphoma. PCR amplification was performed on FFPE of 50 patients with B cell lymphoma, which consisted of 11 cases of with HLs, 25 cases of B NHLs and 14 cases of B LPD (lymphoproliferative disorders) with an unknown subtype. Positive clonality was detected in 76% of patients with B NHLs, with 24% of the cases illustrating clonality showing a polyclonal pattern. In B HLs, 63% of the cases showed clonality and 36% of the cases showed polyclonality. In addition, positive clonality was observed in 42.8% of cases with B LPD, with clonality not observed in 57% of cases in any of the immunoglobulin gene family (FR1, FR2, FR3. In the DLBCL groups, clonality was detected 75% of the cases. Patients which were diagnosed with FL and MALTs showed 100% clonality for complete IGH. However, our investigation on FFPE tissue revealed that EuroClonality BIOMED 2 protocols could be considered as a valuable and reliable method for clonality detection, especially in IGH analysis.

It expresses multiple systemic complications with both structural and functional defects as a part of the clinical manifestation. Me chanism of immune changes occurring in Down Syndrome is complex and include extra gene copy of chromosome 21 and secondary dysregulation of numerous intercellular interactions. Recent studies suggest a role of IL 17 proinflammatory cytokine located on 6p12 chromosome in the pathogene sis of autoimmune diseases. Here we aimed to analyze IL17A gene expressi on in peripheral white cells and interleukin 17A intracellular expression on CD4+ T cells. The research was carried out on the group of 58 children aged 6 to 12 including the group of 30 children with Down Syndrome (the simp le trisomy of chromosome 21 only) and the reference group of 28 healthy children. We evaluated gene IL17A expression using real time PCR and in tracellular IL 17A analyzed by flow cytometry. We revealed significantly de creased gene expression on white cells and significantly decreased expres sion on IL 17A levels on CD4+ T cells in Down Syndrome. Our data indicate that decreased IL 17A expression may play significant role in etiology of autoimmune diseases in Down Syndrome. Moreover, we demonstrated that in Down Syndrome the other gene located outside the extra chromosome 21 is also affected.",2014

Genetic defects have been identified in the majority but not all ca ses. Lack of a familial marker impairs counseling and appropriate treatment strategy, also allowing misdiagnosing. We describe the example of a consanguineous family in which three children died of complications associated with FHL directed therapies, which turned out to be undue in the light of the recently defined diagnosis. Given the incomplete fitting of the clinical pictures with FHL diagnostic cri teria, and lack of mutations in the FHL related genes, whole exome sequen cing of constitutional DNA of both consanguineous parents was performed. The novel c. A773G p. Y258C mutation was identified in both carrier parents and confirmed by Sanger sequencing, which showed it at the homozygous state in one affected child. The diagnosis of FHL, made elsewhere in the early Ã¢ÂÂ80s based on the clinical picture only, drove the decision to treat the child with an aggressive approach including chemotherapy. Recurrence of the disease and the fatal outcome of the initial case supported the choice of an aggressive therapeutic approach in this family. Identification of homozy gous mutation of the FAS ligand gene allowed to redefine the diagnosis, from FHL with unknown genetic defect to FASLG. Definition of genetic diagnosis of congenital immune deficiencies may have not only counselling but also therapeutic implications and should be thus pursued, even retrospectively. Exome sequencing could be a valid tool to help defining genetic bases of difficult clinical pictures.",2014
22506,"The von Willebrand factor circulates in plasma in a complex with coagula tion factor VIII joined by noncovalent bonds. This interaction prevents en zymatic degradation of factor VIII (FVIII) and ensures its transport to the place of the fibrin clot formation. The factor VIII is transformed to factor VIIIa (activated) and acts as a co factor for Factor IX activated (FIXa), which will continue activating next step in the blood clotting cascade. Because of their close relationship, decreasing activity of one or another factor may be affected, or they may also affect the other. The late generates a clinical dia gnosis not very accurate, sometimes for Haemophilia A or von Willebrand disease. We report here a Colombian family that suffers the two diseases according to clinical diagnosis. However, the lack of a genetic study to verify and contrast the diagnosis made by health institutions which is based on phenotype only, can lead to a wrong classification of von Willebrand disease as a type of mild Haemophilia. The aim of this study was to confirm the clini cal diagnosis in this family by molecular analysis. To achieve this, we identify the presence of the most common inversions of FVIII gene in introns 22 and 1 by LD PCR and a general scan of the gene for frameshift mutations or stop codons through three family generations. The use of molecular techniques to confirm the clinical diagnosis for bleeding disorders will improve adequa te treatment and patient prognosis in Colombia.",2014
22507,"Aim: HashimotoÃ¢ÂÂs thyroiditis (HT) is the most prevalent autoimmune thy roid disorder caused by an interaction between genes and environmental triggers. Intra thyroid lymphocytic infiltration may lead to progressive de struction of thyroid tissue and consequently hypothyroidism. Many studies in other populations have shown association between vitamin D receptor (VDR) gene polymorphisms and various autoimmune diseases, including HT . Methods: The study included 44 female patients (mean age ÃÂ± standard deviation 38ÃÂ±5.4) with HashimotoÃ¢ÂÂs thyroiditis and 32 healthy controls of age , sex and geographically matched adult without personal history of autoimmune and endocrine diseases. Genomic DNA was isolated from pe ripheral blood EDTA, and target VDR gene was genotyped by PCR RFLP technique after VDR FokI (rs2228570), VDR TaqI (rs731236) and VDR ApaI (rs7975232) restriction enzymes digestion. Results: We use Arlequin 3.5 integrated software for population genetics data analysis and found signi ficant difference in the genotype distribution of VDR FokI polymorphism between HT patients and controls (P,0,00465). For ApaI and TaqI we found the higher frequency of variant allele but not significantly different compa red to control women (p>0,05), which is consistent with previous studies. Conclussion: The current first and preliminary results identified the asso ciation between VDR FokI gene polymorphism and HashimotoÃ¢ÂÂs thyroiditis in the Serbian population. Results need to be supported by further investi gations that define haplotypes patterns for VDR gene polymorphisms in a larger group of HT patients of both sexes.",2014
22508,"A 30 year old Caucasian man presented with significant iron overload (fer ritin 3287, transferrin saturation 87%) and was found to be homozygous for the C282Y HFE mutation. He concomitantly had mild microcytic anemia, and was found to have a missense mutation in HBA2 (c.242T>G). This mutation is known to produce an unstable hemoglobin (called Hemoglobin Ann Arbor) and cause mild, chronic hemolytic anemia in the heterozygous state. The patientÃ¢ÂÂs mother also carries the Ann Arbor mutation. Interestingly, she is a C282Y/H63D HFE compound heterozygote. However, at age 55, she showed no signs of hemochromatosis (ferritin 197, transferrin saturation 40%,).Severe iron overload has been reported as a complication of specific erythroid disorders (including sideroblastosis and porphyrias) in the context of HFE homozygosity (and questionably C282Y/H63D compound heterozygosity). However, to our knowledge, no cases of HFE mutations in combination with alpha globin mutations or deletions have been reported. We propose that the instablility of hemoglobin Ann Arbor leads to increased erythropoetic activity and enhanced iron absorption, which predisposed this C282Y HFE homozygote to atypically early onset hemochromatosis. The motherÃ¢ÂÂs normal iron profile is consistent with the weakly penetrant C282Y/H63D genotype, however it is noteworthy that in contrast to her C282Y ho mozygous son, HFE compound heterozygosity in combination with the Ann Arbor mutation did not result in early onset hemochromatosis in this indi vidual.

22511,"Interleukin 1 (IL1) is a pro inflammatory cytokine involved in a wide range of physiological processes, including a central role in the regulation of acute and chronic inflammation. The biological effects of IL1 (IL1ÃÂ± and IL1ÃÂ²) are realized upon binding of the cytokine to the membrane bound IL1 type I receptor (IL1RI). The biological activity of IL1 is dependent on the expres sion level of its membrane bound receptors. The aim of this study was to determine if there is an association between single nucleotide polymorphis ms (SNPs) in the IL1RI receptor gene with the expression level of membra ne bound IL1RI on subpopulations of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and on serum levels of soluble IL1 receptors (sIL1RI) in healthy individuals. Serum levels of sIL1RI were determined via ELISA. Expressi on levels of membrane bound IL1RI were determined by flow cytometry and genotyping was carried out using PCR RFLP . This study did not reveal any association between the serum levels of sIL1RI and the SNPs examined. Healthy individuals with genotype GG in SNP rs3917225 and genotype CC in SNP rs2234650 in IL1RI displayed increased levels of membrane bound IL1RI on intact CD14 + cells. Individuals with genotype TT in SNP rs2234650 showed a lower percentage of cells expressing IL1RI in populations of in tact CD14 + monocytes and in a population of CD14+ monocytes from mock stimulated cultures of PBMCs. In summary, this study found that polymor phisms in the IL1 type I receptor gene can influence the expression level of membrane bound receptors on immunocompetent cells.",2014

Relative mRNA and prote in expressions were quantified by quantitative real time PCR and Western blotting, respectively. Trypan blue assay was performed to assess tumor cell proliferation after siRNA transfection. The cytotoxic effect of siRNAs on leukemic cells was measured using MTT assay. Apoptosis was also detected by the annexin V/PI double staining method. siRNAs clearly lowered both Mcl 1 and survivin expression levels in a time dependent manner, resulting in marked inhibition of cell survival and proliferation. Furthermore, siRNA co transfection significantly enhanced the extent of HL 60 apoptotic cells relative to single transfection.

Viral entry into CD4 + T cells is mediated by the interaction with a cellular chemokine receptor, the most common of which are CCR5 and CXCR4 (1). Cells of persons homozygous for the CCR5 gene variant ÃÂ32 (CCR5ÃÂ32/ÃÂ32) are naturally resistant to infection with CCR5 tropic HIV strains (R5 HIV) because of the lack of functional CCR5 cell surface expres sion (2). Our data based on the general population in Czech Republic show a frequency of approximately 20% heterozygous persons. Four homozygous persons bearing ÃÂ32 mutation (CCR5ÃÂ32/ÃÂ32) were identified out of 709 individuals tested.

Despite pro gress on the elucidation of driver mutations and genes for CLL malignancy, the precise pathways responsible for the heterogeneous evolution of CLL are currently unknown. MicroRNAs are small non coding RNAs that function in regulation of gene expression. Aberrant microRNA expression has been linked to CLL, affec ting major oncogenic pathways. We have explored microRNA expression in a well annotated cohort of 97 CLL patient cases by small RNA sequencing. Data were analyzed using our in house SMARTAR pipeline. In addition, DNA (whole exome sequencing, WES and whole genome sequencing, WGS) and messenger RNA sequencing (mRNAseq) data was obtained for 88 cases. In tegration of mRNA and small RNA sequencing data reveals differential ex pression of several microRNAs with CLL related targets. An interesting can didate is miR 150, implicated in hematopoietic differentiation. We found an anti correlation in expression levels of miR 150 and its targets, suggesting that deregulation of the miR 150 pathway could be implicated in disease evolution of CLL. Moreover, GES and WES data are used to study the effect of SNVs and CNVs on microRNA expression and processing. Interestingly, expression levels of microRNA pairs within clusters are correlated, suggesting that structural variations in the CLL genome might indeed comprise the loss of microRNAs located in this region.",2014

Distinction is complicated since infections; viral in particu lar, can trigger genetic HLH. HLH has overlapping clinical symptoms with visceral leishmaniasis (VL) and may remain under recognized because of difficulties in diagnosis and rapidly fatal outcome. Genetic HLH triggered by VL has not been described. One year old girl from a consanguineous family diagnosed as VL by showing Leishmania amastigots in bone marrow aspi rates (BMA). Symptoms also fulfilling HLH diagnostic criteria were resolved by therapy for VL initially but reappeared subsequently despite clearance of amastigots in BMA. HLH2004 protocol therapy achieved remission however recurrence observed afterwards. Mutation analysis in HLH genes revealed homozygous 627delT frameshift mutation in exon 8 of UNC13D gene lea ding to frameshift and premature termination of translation 40 amino acids downstream. Parents were heterozygous for this single nucleotide deletion. Stem cell donor was not available. Until she died at age four, remissions were followed by HLH reactivations and/or five central nervous system relapses under continuous protocol therapy. In conclusion, HLH developed in VL may have genetic etiology and VL may trigger underlying genetic HLH, which may make diagnosis and therapy even more complicated and mortality rate very high. Awareness created among clinicians might thereafter have impor tant public health impact in lifesavings, disease surveillance and eradicati on especially in endemic tropical and subtropical countries.

22522,"Hemophilia A, resulting from coagulation factor VIII deficiency is caused by a large variety of disease causing mutations in FVIII gene and point mutati ons are the most prevalent and deleterious mutation. Active form of factor VIII includes A1/A2/A3 C1 C2 domains. Each domain plays a critical role in FVIII function and structure. The A3 domain near the phospholipid mem brane is in close association with the C1 and C2 domains. Many moderate hemophilia phenotypes are caused by missense mutations that alter the binding of FVIII to VWF. These mutations are clustered within the C1 and C2 domain. In this study two novel point mutations were investigated form a patient with serum factor VIII level less than 1% and a moderate bleeding phe notype. He has no history of bleeding diathesis and/or coagulation factor transfusion in recent 5 years. Entire coding region and exon intron boun daries were investigated using direct sequencing method. Two novel point mutations (c.5359G>A and c.6521A>G) were detected which lead to amino acid substitution E1787K and H2174R respectively. These nucleotide varia tions also present in patientÃ¢ÂÂs mother in heterozygote state in Cis. In silico analysis with SIFT , Polyphen 2, PANTER and I Mutant 2 soft wares showed moderate effect of these mutations on protein structure and function that could explain the moderate phenotype of disease. According to the finding it seems using bioinformatics in silico analysis of the novel mutation could help to predict functional effect of nucleotide alte ration especially in milder clinical presentation.

The Vel antigen is present on red blood cells (RBCs) from all hu mans except rare Vel negative individuals who can form antibodies to Vel in response to transfusion or pregnancy. These antibodies may cause seve re hemolytic reactions in blood recipients. We combined SNP profiling and transcriptional network modeling to link the Vel negative phenotype to SMIM1, located in a 97 kb haplotype block on chromosome 1p36. This gene encodes a previously undiscovered, evolutionarily conserved transmembra ne protein expressed on RBCs. Notably, 35 of 35 Vel negative individuals were homozygous for a frameshift deletion of 17 bp in exon 3. Functional studies using antibodies raised against SMIM1 peptides confirmed a null phenotype in RBC membranes, and SMIM1 overexpression induced Vel ex pression. Genotype screening estimated that ~1 of 17 Swedish blood donors is a heterozygous deletion carrier and ~1 of 1,200 is a homozygous deleti on knockout and enabled identification of Vel negative donors. Our results establish SMIM1 as a new erythroid gene and Vel as a new blood group sy stem. (Nature Genetics 2013; 45(5):537 541)",2014

The array Comparative Genomic Hybridization technology (aCGH) is inten sively used in research and clinical diagnosis for the detection and identi fication of genome rearrangements in patients with different physical/intel lectual development anomalies. The aim of our study was to apply the aCGH technology in evaluation with high resolution of the entire genome in pediatric patients with developmen tal delay (DD), intellectual disabilities (ID) and dysmorphic features (DF) for identifying the genetic causes responsible for the clinical observation. Twenty patients with DD, ID and DF from Romania, aged between 4 months and 14 years, were included in high resolution aCGH analysis with Nimble Gen ISCA Plus 3x1.4M Platform (Roche). All patients were previously as sessed by conventional cytogenetic analysis. The aCGH analysis detected clinically relevant chromosomal abnormalities in seven of the patients analyzed, as follows: micro deletions ranging between 2.5 Kb 6 Mb, associated with Pitt Hop kins syndrome (18q21.2), obesity, ID/DF (6q16.1 q16.2 q16.3), DiGeorge syndrome (22q11.2); micro duplications ranging between 12.5 Kb 1.9 Mb, associated with ID (17q23.2), the Potocki Lupski rare syndrome (17p12 11.2) and autism (Xp22.11); a 30 MB duplication (8q13.3 q22.3), leading to the identification and exact characterisation of a marker chromosome indicated by conventional cyto genetic analysis. Genomic anomalies identified and characterized by aCGH provided accurate diagnosis of unidentified or unexplained diseases suspected to have a gene tic cause, contributing to appropriate clinical management of the affected patients. Our study demonstrated that aCGH technology can play a very important role in identification and characterization of cryptic and/or complex chro mosomal rearrangements, being a valuable tool in postnatal diagnosis.",2014

Only few of these genes are published causative in more than one family, while the rest are identified in a single family that are characterized, disclosing the high heterogeneity of the genetic basis. MRT4 was published in 2007 in an examination of a large consanguineous family with four affected members. The linked region at 1p21.1 1p13.3 was 6.6 megabase commencing 78 genes.

Many cohorts have established the significance of genomic imba lances in intellectual/developmental delay, multiple congenital anomalies and autism spectrum disorders. Most of these studies have been conducted in Western populations and have predicted an overall detection of 15 20% when using whole genome arrays. We have performed 1000 array CGH studies in the past three years. 280 of these cases have been referred for ID/DD, MCA or ASD. We detected a patho genic CNV in 45 of these cases, with an overall detection rate of 16%. Con sidering that 13 of the cases with CNVs were referred following aberrations detected in cytogenetic analysis and for confirmation of these abnormali ties, the rate of detection among unselected cases is 12% (32/263). As this is to the best of our knowledge among the first case series of pa tients from Middle Eastern populations, we would like to postulate the si gnificance of consanguinity in the possible detection rate of genomic imba lances. First, there is an increased possibility of homozygosity for CNVs as a result of consanguinity, as detected in one of our cases with homozygous deletion of GRID2 gene.

These deletions have also been associated with obesity. A ~550 kb deletion is commonly reported; and a smaller deletion of an adjacent region on 16p11.2 has also been found in patients with overlapping clinical fea tures. The phenotypic spectrum of rearrangements in this genomic region remains to be fully characterized. Methods: We describe two new unrelated cases with 16p11.2 microdeletions diagnosed by whole genome oligonu cleotide array CGH. We also compare the phenotype of our patients with other cases described in the literature. Results: One patient, referred to our clinic with moderate developmental delay, significant behavioral problems and unspecific dysmorphisms, has the Ã¢ÂÂtypicalÃ¢ÂÂ ~550 kb deletion. There is a known family history of learning disabilities. However it was not possible to test his relatives because he was placed in institutional care.

We investigated the presence of submicroscopic chromoso mal abnormalities by MLPA and aCGH in 50 patients with idiopathic ID that were selected in three institutions of the state of SÃÂ£o Paulo Brazil, after clinical and laboratorial evaluation. All 50 individuals with ID were inve stigated by MLPA with the kits P036 E1, P070 B1 (subtelomeric rearran gements) and P245 A2 (microdeletion syndromes). The P036 E1 identified one subtelomeric deletion in 4p16.3 (1/50) (2%), confirmed by P070 B1. While the P245 A2 detected two alterations (2/50) (4%), the deletion al ready identified 4p16.3 and one microduplication in region 22q11.2.

Whole genome screening using array CGH follows in cases of negative results or as an alteration size specification (4x180K). Afterwards, FISH is usually used for both methods confirmation. Since 2007 to 2013, 1030 patients were examined. Chromosomal aberrati ons were detected in 124 patients (12%). Using MLPA, 931 patients were examined and alterations were found in 90 cases (9.7%) 43 subtelome ric changes (P036, P070), 14 DiGeorge syndrome (P250) and 33 another changes including 4 Williams Beuren syndrome, 3 Slavotinek syndrome, 3 cases of 1q21 microduplication syndrome (P245, P297). There were exami ned 99 patients by array CGH and chromosomal aberrations were obser ved in 32 patients (35.5%). These findings can be devided into pathogenic (11), benign (3) and variation of unknown significance (18). According to the origin, we found 6 de novo cases, 6 cases with familial origin and 20 cases of unknown significance. World databases of patients (e.i.

We present an economic evaluation conducted in a retrospective cohort of patients with undiagnosed learning disability and developmental delay referred consecutively to the regional clinical genetics service at GuyÃ¢ÂÂs and St ThomasÃ¢ÂÂ NHS Foundation Trust. We compare the use of array CGH as a first line diagnostic tool versus as a second line diagnostic tool following karyotype analysis from a clinical genetics service perspec tive. Data were extracted for 848 patients in the first line test arm and 742 patients in the second line test arm. The mean incremental cost of testing patients was ÃÂ£241.56 which means that using array CGH as a first line was cost saving. The mean incremental gain in the percentage diagnoses was 0.39% which meant that an additional 0.39 patients would gain a diagnosis for every 100 patients tested. We calculated both the incremental cost effec tiveness ratio and the net monetary benefit and found the first line testing strategy to dominate the second line testing strategy. Sensitivity analyses conducted support these conclusions. Based on these findings, we estimate that moving to a first line testing strategy will have saved in excess of ÃÂ£3 million based on 14,000 patients tested whilst also improving the number of diagnoses identified at GuyÃ¢ÂÂs and St ThomasÃ¢ÂÂ NHS Foundation Trust.",2014

Pathologically, it is the formation of amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles in the brain. The most common form of AD is Late onset AD (LOAD), and is usually sporadic. Although several susceptibility genes for AD have been reported, by far the strongest genetic risk factor for LOAD is Apolipoprotein E that located on chromosome 19q13.2 and univer sally recognized as a major disease susceptibility gene for LOAD. APOE has three common alleles, APOE 2, APOE 3, APOE 4. In this study we examined association of the APOE gene polymorphism (rs121918398) with Alzhei mer disease in Iran northern population. Methods: Study included 50 patients with AD and 50 healthy volunteers. An informed consent was obtained from all participants. Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood leukocyte.

Several studies show that Val66Met polymorphism is implicated in cognitive impairment, depression, intracel lular trafficking, reduced hippocampal volume etc. Materials and methods: In this study 202 patients with AD and 97 healthy controls, matched to the patients by age, gender and ethnicity (NC) were included. Genotypes were determined using TaqMan assay (Applied Biosystems). Statistical analysis was done using Plink toolset and chi square test. Results and discussion: The Val66Met polymorphism showed significant difference in allele frequency distribution between the AD and NC group. The common Val allele was more frequent among AD patients, while the rare Met allele was associated with decreased risk of AD (P,0.01, OR,0.58), When the sample was analysed in sub groups according to the age of onset, significant association was found in the early onset group (EOAD) (P, 0.01, OR, 0.51), but not in the group with late onset (LOAD) (P, 0.07, OR, 0.62).

Most familial cases are recessive and genetic studies have demonstrated mutations in several riboflavin transpor ter encoding genes (i.e. SLC52A3 [hRFT2], SLC52A2 [hRFT3] and SLC52A1 [hRFT1]) and the UBQLN1 gene. Objective. To describe the phenotypic and genotypic characteristics of an Ita lian family with autosomal dominant BVVLS. Patients and methods. The proband is a 16 years old girl affected by BVVLS since she was 3. A second case in the family is the probandÃ¢ÂÂs maternal aunt, who was diagnosed with BVVLS at age of 27; however, deafness and bulbar weakness had started during adolescence. No other family members are af fected. DNA was extracted from blood of the proband and several relatives. A scree ning for patogenic mutations in riboflavin transporter genes and UBQLN1 was performed. Results. No pathogenic mutations in all three riboflavin transporter genes were detected. We found that the proband was bearing a heterozygous sub stitution E54D in exon 1 of the UBQLN1 gene, previously suggested to be implicated in the disease. This polymorphism was also present in a healthy adult family member. Conclusions. We identified a rare BVVLS family with an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance with incomplete penetrance and variability of age at onset. The UBQLN1 gene might represent a genetic risk factor for this rare motor neuron disease.",2014

FOXP1 haploinsufficiency has been reported in about 10 patients with specific facial features, global developmental delay, intellectual disability, and speech impairment, where expressive skills are more severely affected than receptive skills. Case description We report on a 2 year old Caucasian boy, born at term with relative macrocephaly. He de veloped neonatal cholestasis for which an extensive etiological assessment was performed, including JAG1 (Alagille syndrome) and ABCB4 (PFIC3) gene analysis. Ductular paucity was objectified with progressive improvement and genetic work up was normal. Progressively, global developmental delay was observed. He had axial hypotonia, dyskinetic movements and is still not able to walk. Expressive language has not yet been acquired, though recep tive language appears more advanced. Growth is normal. He has frequent respiratory tract infections, bronchial hyperreactivity and gastro esopha geal reflux. Facial features include prominent and broad forehead, bilateral palpebral ptosis, broad nasal tip and arched palate. Hypoplastic nails are also observed. Chromosome molecular analysis using CytoScan HD array (Affymetrix) revealed a de novo ~120kb heterozygous interstitial deletion at 3p13 covering exons 7 to 11 of the FOXP1 gene. Conclusion Global de velopmental delay, expressive language delay, relative macrocephaly and specific facial features are associated with FOXP1.

Heterozygous glucocerebrosidase (GBA) gene mutations are a common risk factor for Parkinson Disease (PD). GBA mutation carriers display cognitive and neuropsychiatric disorders more frequently than PD patients without GBA mutations. We describe a male patient carrying two GBA in cis mutations and affected by a severe early onset parkinsonism associated with behavior disorders and cognitive decline. The patient had been presenting apathy and memory loss since the age of 33. One year later he developed a bradykinetic parkinsonism partially re sponsive to levodopa therapy. SPECT study showed mild striatal presynaptic dopaminergic dysfunction. The neuropsychological assessment performed at 34 years of age showed deficits in all tested skills with worse perfor mances in executive function and attention and relative sparing of visuospa tial abilities; Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) score was 26/30. At 37 years of age MMSE score was 22/30. Brain MRI showed diffuse and symmetric brain atrophy with major involve ment of the temporomesial lobes and the cerebellar vermis. Testing of PARK2, LRRK2, DJ1 and IT15 genes was normal. GBA molecular analysis detected two in cis mutations in exon 10 (L444P and A456P) inhe rited from the father. These mutations are probably due to a recombination event between GBA gene and its pseudogene. Clinical and neuropsychological examination of the father and family history were unremarkable. Reports on GBA mutation carriers with parkinsonism may contribute to defining the cognitive phenotype of these patients, the possible genotype phenotype correlations and the clinical markers that may be useful in iden tifying candidate subjects for GBA genetic testing.",2014

In Ã¢ÂÂpureÃ¢ÂÂ HSP , lower limb spasticity and progressive weakness are observed. Ã¢ÂÂComplicatedÃ¢ÂÂ HSP additionally include neurological and non neurological symptoms. HSP can be inherited in autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive, or X linked man ner. Thirty two loci and 23 genes are associated with autosomal recessive form of HSP (ARHSP). One patient was selected for whole exome sequen cing (WES) from each of six ARHSP families from Turkey. After determining candidate variations, segregation analyses were performed in the families to confirm that the variation can be responsible for the HSP phenotype. In two of the families mutations were identified in known HSP genes. First mu tation is the c.4321C>T (p. A1394X) variation in Spastizin gene (SPG15) in family H61. Spastizin is the second most common causative gene for ARHSP with thin carpus callosum that is also observed in our patient. The other mu tation is c.325_326insTGTC insertion in ALS2 gene in family H59. ALS2 gene is responsible for juvenile amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (JALS) and infantile onset hereditary spastic paraplegia (IAHSP). Four families were found to be negative for mutations in known HSP genes. In two of the families, novel HSP candidate genes were identified and segregation with the disease was shown in the families.

Huntington disease is caused by a dominantly transmitted CAG repeat ex pansion mutation that is believed to confer a toxic gain of function on the mutant protein. Huntington disease patients with two mutant alleles are very rare. In other poly(CAG) diseases such as the dominant ataxias, inhe ritance of two mutant alleles causes a phenotype more severe than in he terozygotes. We identified a homozygous female patient, 89 years old and compared clinical features with those of a group of heterozygotes. The age of onset was within the range expected for heterozygotes with same CAG repeat lengths. However, she showed a rather different clinical course with emotional instability and behavioral disorders. Cerebral magnetic resonance imaging showed no evident atrophy, notably not in the cerebral cortex or the striatum. Clinical examination revealed she had chorea predominating on the upper limbs and the trunk. She was partially unable to control the speed and the force of her movements and mild dysarthria was noted. Se vere memory deficits associated with a severe frontal deficit were found, all symptoms suggesting Huntington disease. Mutation analysis revealed two HTT alleles with CAG repeats of 43 and 45. This suggests that although ho mozygosity for the Huntington disease mutation does not lower the age at onset of symptoms, it affects the disease phenotype and progression. These data, once confirmed in a larger series of patients, will point to the possibi lity that the mechanisms underlying age at onset and disease progression in Huntington disease may differ.",2014

Pathophysiology of disease involves several tissues; indeed it has been shown that there is a broad toxic effect of mHTT in the peripheral tissue of patients with HD. In this study we compared gene expression profiles of HD fibroblasts and matched controls using microar ray technology. We used RT PCR to test the consistency of the microarray data and we found four genes up regulated in HD patients with respect to control individuals. The genes appear to be involved in different pathways that have been shown to be perturbed even in HD models and patients.

22582,"Introduction: Today, A role for vitamin D and itÃ¢ÂÂs receptor (VDR) in ParkinsonÃ¢ÂÂs disease (PD) has been proposed. Several studies concerning the association between the VDR gene polymorphism and PD have been published. In this study, firstly we determined the correlation between 25 hydroxy vitamin D (25 OHD) and severity of PD then accessed frequency of FokI polymorphism in PD patients and healthy Iranian population. Methods: The severity of PD was evaluated by using Hoehn & Yahr (HR) stages and Unified ParkinsonÃ¢ÂÂs Disease Rating Stage (UPDRS) Part III. Af ter amplification of DNA samples from 62 unrelated normal individuals and 60 PD patients by PCR, polymorphism was genotyped by RFLP according to FokI site. Results: Our study revealed that 25OHD level in patients with PD was not as sociated with HR stage and UPDRS scores . The most frequency of genotype in PD group and normal individuals was FF (51.7%) and Ff (51.6%), respec tively. Protection against the development of PD was applied when F allele be present, but it was not significant (OR, 0.7, 95%CI: 0.44 1.28, p,0.29). In contrast, insignificant susceptibility to PD (OR, 1.3, 95%CI: 0.437 1.283, p,0.29) was associated to f allele. Conclusion: Our finding does not show correlation between vitamin D and HR stage and UPDRS scores during the early disease stages of PD in Iranian patients. Furthermore, after genotypes analysis, no significant association was seen for FokI polymorphism with Parkinson . Further studies are nee ded to reveal the main role of vitamin D and VDR gene in PD progression.",2014

The incidence of PD differs by race and ethnicity, is greater in men than women, and increases markedly with age. One of the well known ge nes involved in PD development, is alpha synuclein (SNCA) gene and seve ral polymorphisms in this gene have been identified to be associated with PD susceptibility. In this study, we investigated the association of four SNPs (rs2301134, rs2301135, rs356221, rs11931074) in the promoter region and 3ÃÂ´UTR of the SNCA gene, with ParkinsonÃ¢ÂÂs disease in Iranian population. A total of 960 subjects (480 PD patients and 480 normal healthy controls) were included and genotyped for all four polymorphism. The method used for genotyping was tetra primer ARMS PCR. We found significant differences in genotype distributions of rs11931074 variant in patients compared to controls (odds ratio , 7.6970, 95% CI , 5.7514 10.3006, p , <0.0000001).

Although originally thought not to be hereditary, recent studies have identified several genes that are responsible for the manifestation of the disease. Clarification of the molecular basis of disease would allow more accurate diagnosis of the disease and would also help in treatment and prevention. The aim of our work was to study the effect of hypericin, a substance isolated from the plant Hypericum perforatum L., on expression modulation in genes involved in the pathogenesis of ParkinsonÃ¢ÂÂs disease. Experiments were carried out on the A549 (alveolar adenocarcinoma), 42 MG BA (glioma) and MSC (mesen chymal stem) cell lines using microarray and qPCR. Our results show that hypericin can modulate expression of more with ParkinsonÃ¢ÂÂs disease asso ciated genes. We focused on 8 genes, which play main roles in ParkinsonÃ¢ÂÂs disease pathway. We detected prolonged changes in expression of DDC, LRRK2, CYCS and short term changes of other genes during 96 hours of mo nitoring. Our results may help in understanding the molecular mechanism of hypericin action in various neurodegenerative diseases as ParkinsonÃ¢ÂÂs and AlzheimerÃ¢ÂÂs disease.

It is sub grouped according to the anatomy of the anterior chamber angle into two main forms: Primary Open Angle Glaucoma (POAG) and Primary Angle Closure Glaucoma (PACG). POAG is the more predominant form of glaucoma in Europeans, Africans, and possibly most populations. PACG is most pre valent in countries of the far East; 80% of PACG affected individuals live in Asia. PACG is characterized by a narrow iridocorneal angle which obstructs normal aqueous humor outflow and causes increased Intraocular Pressure (IOP). Although epidemiological studies have suggested a genetic basis for PACG, a causative gene for the disease has not been identified. A relatively large pedigree with at least nine members diagnosed with PACG or PACG suspect all of whom presented with a closed iridocorneal angle, was introduced to us. Manifestation of PACG in multiple family members sug gested a strong genetic contribution for the disease in the family. With the objective of identifying a causative gene, whole exome sequencing was per formed on three affected members of the family. Output data were analyzed with appropriate softwares. After filtering against existing SNP databases, 72 novel, non synonymous variants common among the three patients were identified. The variations were distributed in 68 genes.

Idiopathic basal ganglia calcification (IBGC), also known as Ã¢ÂÂFahr disease (FD)Ã¢ÂÂ, is a rare neurological disease characterized by symmetric and bila teral calcifications mostly located in the basal ganglia, but often involving also the thalami, the cerebellar hemispheres and subcortical white matter. Familial IBCG (fIBGC) is genetically heterogenous and typically transmitted in an autosomal dominant fashion, sometimes displaying anticipation. In a recent study SLC20A2 gene mutations were found to be responsible for 40% of the IBGC families studied. We describe a novel SLC20A2 variant in exon 9 (G1618A), consisting in a gly to arg substitution at position 540 of the pro tein highly conserved consensus region, in two family members clinically diagnosed with IBGC. This variant was not found in 200 unrelated Italian controls. The index case was a 67 year old male patient who presented with a mild parkinsonism and a more relevant reduction in spontaneous speech, which evolved steadily over a few years to an almost complete inability to communicate. The probandÃ¢ÂÂs daughter developed symptomatic epilepsy at 19 years of age as the only clinical manifestation of IBCG, suggesting an anticipation of the disease over generations and striking intrafamilial phe notypic heterogeneity, as previously observed. This is the first SLC20A2 mu tation associated to fIBGC reported in the Italian population.

Metals are crucial for synaptic transmission, enzyme activity, proteins fol ding/conformation. Copper, zinc, iron and manganese are all localized to various subcellular compartments and their regulation is controlled by a diverse range of co factors and chaperones. Loss of homeostasis of some of these elements is present in neurological disorders including Alzheimer, Parkinson and Huntington diseases, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and Fried reich Ataxia. Metals are also key factors for ATP generation and to control oxidative damage in mitochondria. We selected a cohort of spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA, n,20) and Ataxia Te langectasia (A T , n,20) patients, and we measured copper, zinc, iron, man ganese and selenium levels in their blood samples, using atomic absorption spectrometry. We found a significantly reduced manganese levels in SCA patients and in creased copper levels in A T patients compared to controls (p<0.01). Cu and Mn have essential roles in mitochondria: the former is a component of com plex IV; manganese has a central role in maintaining antioxidant enzyme function and it is the superoxide dismutase co factor (MnSOD; SOD2).We evaluated in patients vs. controls LCLs mRNA levels of catalase CAT , glutathione peroxidase GPX1 and SOD2, enzymes involved in antioxidative response. We found SOD2 and CAT up regulation in A T patients and a SOD2 down regulation in SCA patients. We considered SOD enzymes activity and showed a reduction of MnSOD activity in SCA LCLs, whereas Cu/ZnSOD activity was halved in A T LCLs.

After C9ORF72 and SOD1, mutati ons TARDBP gene are the most frequent cause of disease in FALS families. TARDBP encodes transactive response DNA binding protein 43 (TDP 43). In addition to its prominent role in ALS, TDP 43 is important because of its potential involvement in the etiology of various neurodegenerative diseases. TDP 43 is a major component of aggregates of misfolded proteins in neu rons of ALS, frontotemporal dementia, AlzheimerÃ¢ÂÂs and ParkinsonÃ¢ÂÂs disease patients.

The coding exons of the gene were sequenced by the Sanger protocol. A single missense muta tion was observed in exon 6 in one FALS patient; no putative disease causing variation was found among the SALS patients.

In this research we studied on the depolymerization of alpha synuclein firbils under induction of fibrillation inhibitory compounds include Curcumin, Cuminaldehyde and Baicalein by using fluorescent labeled alpha synuclein protein. Our result shows that these compounds induce depolimerization of alpha synuclein fibrils that is highly related to their cytotoxicity. Some studies on alpha synuclein fi brillation revealed that intermediate aggregates include oligomeric species may play a greater role than amyloid fibrils in dopaminergic cell death.

Genetic mapping has identified at least 52 different HSP loci, designated SPG (Spastic Paraplegia) 1 through 52. We studied An Iranian family with autosomal recessive HSP with three affected and four unaffected siblings of two consangeous parents. Clinical, neurophysiologic, and neuroradiologic studies were undertaken. Genetic linkage analyses were carried out with polymorphic DNA markers. The candidate gene within the linked region was sequenced in order to verify the observation. Homozygou sity mapping showed linkage to 8q24. As a result the first candidate gene for screening was SPG8 also known as KIAA0196 because this gene is located in the linked region and is one of HSP related genes. The KIAA019 contains 29 exons. Precise screenings of all 29 exons of the gene with their boundaries were carried out using sequencing but all patients were negative for SPG8 mutations. In conclusion, these data confirm the presence of another SPG gene on chromosome 8q24 related to autosomal recessive HSP .",2014

We aimed to assess the main, haplotypic and GxE effect of ESR1 (rs9340799, rs2077647) and OXTR genes (rs4686302) on personality traits variation. We recruited 1018 healthy individuals (68% women) of Caucasian origin (Russians 409, Tatars 290, Bashkir 130, Udmurts 189) from Russia (mean age: 19.81ÃÂ±2.65 years) without any history of psychopathologies subjected to personality assessment (TCI 125). Genotyping of SNPs was performed using PCR RFLP . Statistical analysis was conducted with PLINK v.1.07, Ha ploview 4.1 followed by correction for multiple testing under FDR procedu re. Subsequent haplotype analysis revealed an association of ESR1 A*C ha plotype (rs9340799, rs2077647, DÃ¢ÂÂ,0.76) and A*T haplotype (PFDR,0.008) with high and low self transcendence (ST) (PFDR,0.042), respectively, in Bashkir group. GxE analysis revealed the model ESR1*ethnicity explained variations in ST (PFDR,0.036) and self directedness (SD) (PFDR,0.036). Accordingly, Udmurts carrying rs9340799 G allele demonstrated de creased SD and Bashkirs with rs2077647 C allele reported increased ST . Moreover, association of OXTR rs4686302 A allele and lower Persistence (PFDR,0.031) was observed only in non smoking group. Additionally, OXTR rs4686302* ethnicity model determined variations in SD (PFDR,0.021): Russian individuals with rs4686302 A allele scored higher on this trait. Re ported findings suggest that ethnicity and Ã¢ÂÂsmoking statusÃ¢ÂÂ modulate the association between ESR1 and OXTR gene polymorphisms and personality traits. Thus, ESR1 and OXTR genes might be responsible for mental health and neuroprotection, since character traits (ST and SD) are predictive for personality disorders development.

Eight genetic loci for ARHSP TCC have been iden tified: SPG11, SPG15, SPG21, SPG32, SPG35, SPG46, SPG47 and most recently SPG54. DDHD2 gene, encoding one of the three intracellular phospholipases A1, has been recently identified as cause of the SPG54 form, characterized by intellectual disability, developmental delay and onset in childhood. We identified two compound heterozygous mutations in the DDHD2 gene by using whole exome sequencing in a non consanguineous family with ARHSP TCC. The family includes two affected sibling and unaffected parents. The co ding region of one patient was enriched and captured by SureSelect Human All Exon V4, and exome sequencing was performed using the Hiseq2000 instrument. BWA and GATK software packages were used to align sequence reads to the reference. The data were then imported into Gem.app, a web based database and analysis tool for next generation sequencing data. Exo me sequencing data revealed two compound heterozygous point mutations in the index case in the DDHD2 gene: the novel c.307T>C and the already described c.1978G>C. Both mutations were validated by Sanger sequencing and they were confirmed in the second affected brothers. In conclusion, we report the first Italian patients with two compound he terozygous point mutations in the DDHD2 gene. This finding enlarges the clinical spectrum related to DDHD 2 mutations, providing to determine the worldwide distribution and the diverse clinical features of SPG54 form.",2014

We have analyzed 500 patients coming from Southern Italy, refer red to our centre with a suspected diagnosis of CMT . Firstly, all patients have been screened for the 17p.11.2 duplication. The non duplicated cases were further investigated for point mutations in the GJB1, MPZ and PMP22 genes. Among the 500 unrelated CMT patients, 209 of them (41.8%) harbored the CMT1 duplication. A subsequent mutation analysis of GJB1, MPZ, and PMP22 genes in 291 CMT patients, revealed 26 different mutations in 48 cases: 14 in GJB1, 7 in MPZ, 5 in PMP22. Out of 14 GJB1 missense mutations identified in 16 patients, seven are novel (Ser49Phe, Ala88Val, Ser128Leu, Leu131 Arg, Val148Phe, Phe153Leu and Arg164Leu). Out of 7 mutations in the MPZ gene identified in 27 patients, two are novel (Trp57X and Gly93Arg). Note worthy, in 14 patients from Apulia the known Val102fs mutation has been detected, whereas seven patients from Sicily carried the known Ser78Leu mutation, confirming our previous results of a founder effect for the Ser78 Leu. Finally, in the PMP22 gene we detected two novel variants (Ala35Tyr and Pro122Leu). In conclusion, our data confirm that the duplication is the most common genetic cause of the CMT , followed by mutations in GJB1 and MPZ. Furthermore, this study recommends that for the patients from Apulia and Sicily the diagnostic test, after the exclusion of the duplication, might be start from MPZ gene.",2014

DTNBP1 is the gene encoding Dysbindin or Dystrobrevin binding protein. DTNBP1 is established as a genes associated with certain psychotic disor ders. Genetic variations of DTNBP1 have been found in association of Schi zophrenia, Major Depressive Disorder, Bipolar Disorder, Substance induced Psychosis and certain cognitive properties. Functional studies have conclu ded that reduction of expression is the likely mechanism of effect of DTN BP 1 in pathophysiology of mental conditions. Moreover, due to dysbindin protein functions in neurotransmission, dysfunction mechanisms have been postulated in cognitive and psychotic conditions. In an EWAS on methylome of post mortem brain of major psychoses pati ents, hypermethylation of an intron, promoter and an upstream region of DTNBP1 gene was found to be FDR significant in association with bipolar disorder. Furthermore, variation of DTNBP1 mRNA levels in post mortem cerebellum has been shown to be concordant with it in peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) of the individual in expression profiling studies. In ad dition, the expression reduction of DTNBP1 has been demonstrated in PBL of psychotic patients. Here, we investigated DTNBP1 promoter methylation variation in psycho tic bipolar disorder patients. Preliminarily, methylation level of a promoter CGI of DTNBP1 gene in 46 cases against 85 age and sex matched controls was measured with Quantitative Methylation Specific High Resolution Melting(MS HRM).

We explore the clinical spectrum, neu roimaging, and gene involvement in the first MLC patients described from Egypt. Patients: Six patients were enrolled from three unrelated families. Patient inclusion criteria were macrocephaly, developmental delay, normal urinary organic acids, and brain imaging of diffuse cerebral white matter involvement. Direct sequencing of the MLC1 gene in patientsÃ¢ÂÂ families and GliaCAM in one questionable case was performed. Results: Clinical hetero geneity, both intra and interfamilial, was clearly evident. Developmental delays ranged from globally severe or moderate to mild delay in achieving walking or speech. Head circumference above the ninety seventh percenti le was a constant feature. Neuroimaging featured variability in white mat ter involvement and subcortical cysts. However, findings of posterior fossa changes and brain stem atrophy were frequently (66.6%) identified in these Egyptian patients. Discrepancy between severe brain involvement and nor mal mental functions was evident, particularly in patients from the third family. MLC1 mutations were confirmed in all patients. Deletion/insertion mutation in exon 11 (c.908 918delinsGCA, p. Val303 Gly fsX96) was recur rent in two families, whereas a missense mutation in exon 10 (c.880 C > T , p.

Limb girdle muscular dys trophy (LGMD) is heterogeneous group of disorders affecting the voluntary muscles, mainly around the pelvic and shoulder. Mutations in different ge nes can cause different types of LGMD. To date, at least 15 different genes have been identified as LGMD causative genes. Because, there are many genes for this group of disorders, mutation screening of all these genes is cumbersome and costly. Linkage analysis can be used for selection of the appropriate candidate gene. An Iranian family with four sibling affected with LGMD was identified. Genome wide SNP genotyping was carried out on DNAs of three affected and one unaffected individuals using Human CNV370 Quadv3_C BeadChips. Subsequently, homozygous regions common to affected individuals and absent in the unaffected sibling were sought. Di sease status in the family linked to a homozygous region on chromosomes 2. The DYSF gene that associates with LGMD type 2B was positioned within the linked region. DYSF encodes dysferlin, a protein believed to be involved in the maturation of new muscle fibers and in repairing damage to muscle cells. Sequencing of DYSF exons in the proband of the Iranian revealed a novel insertion deletion that is the likely cause of LGMD in the family.

The MH crisis is induced by exposure of the predisposed patients to halogenated volatile anaesthetics. Molecular genetic testing indicates that mutations in RYR1 are identified in up to 80% cases of MHS. More than 400 mutations in RYR1 have been associated with MHS. Most of the RYR1 mutations are private. Almost all MHS causative mutations are missense; however, an in frame deletion of a single amino acid in the central region of RYR1 and a single nucleotide de letion at the extreme C terminal end of the protein have also been reported. Large sized genomic deletion of 6 520 bp was identified as the first genomic rearrangement in the RYR1 gene. Here we report the detection of large sized deletion in the C terminal end of the RYR1 in the MHS confirmed individual. At first, the deletion of exons 90 and 94 was identified using MLPA.

Methods Forty consecutive patients diagnosed by genetic testing were included in this study. The age of onset was defined as the time of the patientÃ¢ÂÂs initial recognition of symptoms and disease duration was represented by the time taken from onset of symptoms to genetic diagnosis. The severity of sym ptoms was assessed by nine ADL milestones. Rate of disease progression was expressed as a number, differences of ADL scores between at onset and diagnosis/disease duration. Results The median age at onset and diagnosis was 44.5 and 52.5 years, respectively. The median disease duration was 5.00 years, median rate of disease progression was 0.2 score/year and median number of CAG repeats in the AR gene was 44. The number of CAG repeats showed significant inverse correlations with the age of onset of muscle wea kness and the age of onset of any symptoms. Interestingly, a statistically si gnificant correlation between rate of disease progression and age at onset was observed while an inverse correlation between rate of disease progres sion and disease duration was noticed. Discussion This study reaffirms the inverse correlation between the age at disease onset and the number of CAG repeats. It is of note that the rate of disease progression is influenced by age at disease onset in Korean SBMA patients.",2014

Most prominent phenotypic characteristics, mentioned in litera ture review are severe speech delay, language delay, a characteristic facies, hypotonia, developmental delay, and social anxiety. Congenital anomalies as heart defects, diaphragmatic hernia, cryptorchidism and non specific brain abnormalities are sporadically reported. We report here an 1 year old male with 7q11.23 microduplication detected by array CGH analysis performed because of speech delay, growth retardati on, hypotonia and polymalformative syndrome associating congenital heart diseases, hydronephrosis, cleft lip, macrocephaly and polydactyly. Fluo rescence in situ hybridization, using ELN gene probe, confirmed the diagno sis, revealing a tandem duplication of the Williams Beuren critical region detectable only on interphase nuclei and karyotype study was normal. This case is one of the most severe reported in the literature and it allows us to expand the phenotypic spectrum of this syndrome.",2014

We report a unique familial case with complementary chromosomal aberrations involving the same distal 8q region, detected on fetus (deletion) and mother (mosaic du plication). Chromosome analysis on chorionic villi at 13 weeks of gestation for increased Down Syndrome risk after maternal serum screening revealed 46,XX,del(8)(q?23q?24.2) karyotype. The 8q deletion was defined as inter stitial by subtelomeric and painting specific FISH probes. The deletion size was investigated by microarray and parental karyotype was performed. Microarray result was arr[hg19] 8q24.11q24.3(119,142,459 144,825,972)x1 with a 25 Mb deletion. The involved region included 74 OMIM genes and no recurrent microdeletion syndromes. Maternal karyotype was mos 46,XX,dup(8)(q?24.1q?24.3)[22]/46,XX[28]; the mosaic interstitial duplica tion was confirmed also by FISH and microarray, which disclosed the same fetal breakpoints. Only two cases have been described with pure 8q24 dupli cation characterized by microarray (Concolino et al., 2012;Wheeler, 2010) and none in mosaic condition. Mother had hydrocephalus at birth, short sta ture, facial dismorphisms, psychomotor and mild cognitive delay. Fetal ultra sound investigation was normal. Similar deletions have never been reported. We speculated about possible clinical consequences evaluating the role of genes mapped in the deleted/duplicated region, such as KCNK9, associated with Birk Barel mental retardation dysmorphism sindrome (#612292); in brain tissues, it is expressed only from maternal allele and this might have a possible role in maternal and newborn phenotype. We have also suggested a possible mechanism of formation of this unique familial case",2014
22625,"The identification of cytogenetic imbalance is an important component of clinical genetics. Genetic abnormalities have been associated with 6 13 % of stillbirth, but the true prevalence may be higher. Chromosomal abnor malities often cause specific and complex phenotypes resulting from an im balance in the normal dosage of genes located in a particular chromosomal segment. Furthermore, many multiple malformation syndromes are caused by deletion or duplication of genomic region. In the interest of diagnosis, conventional cytogenetic analysis such as chromosomal banding technique is applied as the first choice, which allows for the unambiguous identificati on of each human chromosome with the detection of aneuploidy and many large structural rearrangements, including translocations, large deletions and duplications. The molecular cytogenetic platform on which our study is based on is array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH), which is a useful diagnostic method to detect a complex cytogenetic syndromes and diseases. The aim of our study is to extensively apply, further applied and validate sensitive high throughput array CGH to efficiently investigate the cytogenetic abnormalities in all regions of Hungary. We introduced the Nim bleGene array platform and we started the molecular cytogenetics analyses in 7 cases. Out of the 7 samples, in which the causative chromosomal effect was confirmed, a gain was identified at four patients (range of the gain was from 39 Mb to 1.3 Mb) and in three cases loss of different regions was detec ted (from 67.4 Mb to 0.17 Mb).

We screened firstly the BBS1, BBS2, and BBS10 genes for both individuals with negative results. But to our surprising, we found a novel nonsense mutation in the one and a novel missense mutation in the other affected individual within the BBS12 gene. In both cases, parents were heterozygous for detected changes. To validate the pathogenic consequence of the missense mutation, 65 healthy individuals were checked. Recently, a BBS patient has been reported from north Iran with a disease causing mu tation in the BBS12 gene. We also suggest the BBS12 gene as a strong candi date for mutation hunting in the BBS affected individuals in the Middle East, at least in Iran.",2014

Chromosomal rearrangements are rare structural rearrangements with three or more breakpoints and exchange of genetic material between two or more chromosomes. The rearrangements may be balanced or unbalan ced, and are classified into type I with three to four breaks and familial origin; and type II with five or more breaks, which generally arise de novo. Unbalanced chromosomal rearrangements may lead to significant clinical consequences such as multiple congenital anomalies, dysmorphic features, and mental subnormality in the progeny. Balanced chromosomal rearran gements are often not associated with any phenotypic abnormalities and may remain undetected in family members through multiple generations. Case presentation: The patient was a 5.5 years old girl referred to genetic center with delayed development. She was born from second cousin familial marriage by normal vaginal delivery, walked and spoken from 2 years old. Congenital right knee dislocation was treated. Delayed speech was limited in about 3 words and was suffering from speech apraxia. The signs were hypertelorism, strabismus, epicanthal fold, narrow palpebral fissure, sparse eyebrows, strabismus, decayed teeth, clinodactyly of fifth fingers, increased distance between toes 2 and 3, semisyndactyly of the toes 2 and 3, and shor tened fourth and fifth metatarses.

A combination of methods was applied cytogenetic analysis, FISH method, oligo DNA microarrays. The results of analysis of microarrays revealed definite etiology in 9 out of 52 patients tested. Fifteen pathological aberrations were found in them. All pathological findings were validated by FISH analysis. Genotype/phenoty pic correlations between different patients were confirmed. In addition, the majority of the patients tested (41 patients) showed 124 normal variations in the number of copies and 108 variations of unknown clinical significance (34 patients). Analyses of the type and distribution of the different varia tions was performed and the clinical significance of variants of unknown nature was discussed. Our results show the advantages of high resolution microarrays for clinical diagnosis of patients with congenital malformations associated intellectu al disability. The results also highlight the need for extensive population studies revealing the molecular nature and clinical significance of different CNVs and the creation of detailed maps of variations in the Bulgarian po pulation.

At birth he presented with saggital craniosynostosis and seizures. Further examination revealed complications including a cardiac malforma tion. At eight years and two months the patient showed neuropsychomotor and behavioral anomalies. G banding showed an apparently normal male karyotype. A DNA sample was taken for chromosome microarray analy sis (CMA) using the Affymetrix 750k CytoScan array. The results showed terminal alterations of chromosomes 17 and 20. Specifically, there was a duplication on the long arm of chromosome 17 (chr17:78,952,204 81 ,060,886), together with a deletion of 1.4 Mb of long arm of chromosome 20 (chr20:61,643,144 63,003,805). The deletion on chromosome 17 includes more than 80 genes and miRNAs, while the deletion on chromosome 20 in cludes more than 50 genes and miRNAs. The data are indicative of an unba lanced translocation of part of chromosome 17 to chromosome 20. Partial trisomy of chromosome 17q has been previously reported in the literature, and the patient reported here shows phenotypic overlap with the previous ly reported spectrum, including psychomotor delay, craniofacial assymetry and other dysmorphisms.

Here, we report on a duplicati on producing phenotypic outcome similar to chromosome 5p13 duplication syndrome, spanning 5p13.3p13.2. Using SNP/oligonucleotide CGH, a du plication within 5p13.3p13.2 affecting a genomic locus of 994 kb spanning TARS, ADAMTS12, RXFP3, SLC45A2, AMACR and C1QTNF3 in a one year old boy presented with severe intellectual disability, developmental delay, cor pus callosum hypoplasia, microcephaly, congenital cataract, congenital optic atrophy and large ears. It is noteworthy that the present case exhibits more severe phenotype than previously described in chromosome 5p13 dupli cation syndrome. Therefore, duplication of these disease associated genes causes a more severe subtype of this duplication syndrome. Additionally, chromosome instability manifesting as aneuploidy has been observed in the index case. Bioinformatic pathway analysis has shown that chromosome insatiability is likely to result from alteration of aneuploidization and cell cycle regulation pathways through interaction of RXFP3 product with APP and PSEN1/2, alteration to which disrupts the mitotic spindle and directly inhibits mitotic microtubule motors. Furthermore, the duplication has the potential to cause chromosome instability through altered interactions bet ween AMACR product and ubiquitins. Thus, high resolution analysis of copy number variations in this case provided for efficient correlation between genotype and phenotype data, which can be used to elucidate pathogenic processes in a given patient. In addition, this case representing a severer va riant of chromosome 5p13 duplication syndrome has also allowed defining previously unknown pathway to chromosome instability.

Testing for PMP22 duplication was performed, and it was positi ve for the older sister. Karyotype of both sibs established by GTG banding was 46,XX, der(5)t(5;19)(p15.3;q13.2). Subsequent chromosome analysis in parents revealed maternal balanced translocation t(5;19)(p15.3;q13.2), which was later confirmed by FISH. The same translocation was detected in grandmother. Both del5p and dup19q are described in literature as pathogenic imbalan ces. 5p terminal deletion causes cri du chat syndrome (mewing cry, micro cephaly, epicanthus, depressed nasal bridge, fifth finger clinodactyly, hypo tonia). 19q13.2ÃÂ qter duplication is associated with wide range of congenital anomalies and dysmorphic facial features, including growth retardation, mi crocephaly, heart defects, hypoplasia of the gallbladder, renal anomalies, hy pertelorism/flat nasal bridge, dysplastic ears, downturned mouth corners, clinodactyly. Synthesis of del5p15.3 and dup19q13.2 symptoms determines the clinical phenotype of our patients. Additional skeletal malformations in older sister are caused by CMT .

We present the clinical features of a 3 year old boy with mosaic7q36.1 qter microdeletion. Our patient presented with unspecified developmental delay and cognitive impairment with speech delay. Mild facial dysmorphism was noticed, such as upslanted palpebral fissures, prominent nasal bridge and narrow palate. Another phenotypic finding was tapered fingers. Additional features inclu ded unilateral cryptorchidism, low testicular volume and childhood obesity. He had numerous motor mannerisms including body rocking, facial postu ring, self touching. Cytogenetic and molecular cytogenetic FISH analysis re vealed a mosaic male karyotype with a terminal deletion of the long arm of chromosome 7 in 90% analyzed blood cells. The karyotype is described as 46,XY,del(7)(q36.1q36.3)/46,XY. Both parents have normal karyotypes. No family history of congenital anomalies or mental retardation was referred. Our findings, therefore, suggest that the phenotypic consequences are very variable.

Mowat Wilson syndrome (MWS) is a multiple congenital anomaly syndrome characterized by typical facial dysmorphism, moderate to severe intellectual disabilities, epilepsy and variable congenital malformations. MWS is caused by eterozygous mutations or deletions in the Zinc finger E box binding 2 gene, ZEB2: sequence analysis detects mutations in approximately 81% of individuals; FISH detects large deletions encompassing all or part of ZEB2 in approximately 15% of persons; chromosomal rearrangements that dis rupt ZEB2 cause MWS in approximately 2% of individuals; an additional 2% have intermediate sized deletions that can be detected by techniques such as quantitative PCR, MLPA, or gene specific array CGH. We describe two patients with a clinical diagnosis of MWS not confirmed by genetic tests. The first patient is a 5 years old female with typical facial dysmorphisms, aganglionic megacolon, hypoplasia of the corpus callosum, growth retar dation with microcephaly, psychomotor retardation with speech delay and epilepsy.

22649,"Treacher Collins Syndrome (TCS) is a rare craniofacial disorder, associated with an abnormal differentiation of the first and the second pharyngeal ar ches during fetal development. The major features of the disease include: midface hypoplasia, micrognathia, microtia, conductive hearing loss and cleft palate. The estimated incidence is 1/50000 live births, with 60% of the cases resulting from de novo mutations. The syndrome is mostly caused by mutations in the TCOF1 gene, which encodes the serine/alanine rich prote in named Treacle. TCS can be also caused by mutations in the POLR1C and POLR1D genes. Over a hundred mutations of the TCOF1 gene in TCS patients have been described. About 70% of recognized mutations are deletions, which lead to a frame shift, formation of a termination codon and shorte ning of the protein. We report a novel mutation of TCOF1 gene in male patient with typical facial symptoms of TCS. Patient presented: prominent forehead, absent of auricu lar canals, third degree microtia, conductive deafness, sparse eyebrows, cleft of right eyelid, palpebral fissures slant down, broad base to nose, underde velopment of zygomatic region, malar flattening, micro and retrognathia. No internal defects were diagnosed. A multitemperature single stranded conformation polymorphism (MSSCP) analysis and direct sequencing were performed. A novel, heterozygous dele tion c.1978delC was detected. PatientÃ¢ÂÂs parents were tested and no mutati on was observed.

22650,"Introduction Noonan Syndrome (NS) is an autosomal dominant, variably expressed, multisystem disorder with an estimated prevalence of 1 in 1000 2500. After trisomy 21, NS is the second most common syndromic cause of congenital heart disease. In recent years study on the molecular mecha nisms of this disorder have been improved and expressed some pathophy siological mechanisms that cause the complications up to this abnormality such as the great range of medical and developmental features. Methods Genomic DNA samples were extracted from peripheral whole blood of 25 NS patients using the standard procedure. For each patient, exons 1 15 of the PTPN11 gene individually amplify by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using 15 sets of designed primers. The amplified fragments of PTPN11 gene were purified and directly sequenced. Result Three known PTPN11 muta tion hotspots (exons 3, 8, 13) were checked first, and a previously identified mutation (Asn308Asp) was found in only two patients. We also found a no vel non synonymous substitution (Asp155Asn) in exon 4 of an eight years old patient. Conclusion This study is the first report of PTPN11 mutations in Iranian patients with NS. A non synonymous mutation was found in exon 4 that is novel in NS but has registered before as somatic mutation in cancer patients with large intestine tumor. The affected probands who are negative for PTPN11 mutations will be screened for other 10 genes mutations invol ved in NS using next generation sequencing.

OLHS constitutes combinations of congenital mal formations of mandible, tongue, upper and lower limbs and normal mental development. The pathogenesis of OLHS is still unknown, however, it is con sidered to have several possible causes: heat induced vascular disruption; teratogenic etiology and genetic origin of these syndromes. According to HallÃ¢ÂÂs classification OLHS is divided into five categories; with the only ne cessary criteria for inclusion hypoglossia. However, in some cases, there is a considerable overlap of symptoms, making it difficult to define the phe notypic boundaries between OLHS. We report the case of a 3 year old girl. She is the second child of healthy, nonconsanguineous parents, born after an uneventful pregnancy, by normal delivery. She was born in 39gw with low birth weight(1700g) and length(46cm). She has a sister, who is normal. There is no family history of congenital abnormalities. Currently she has low weight(9kg), height(80cm) and microcephaly(44cm). She has a mental retardation and absence of speech. Her face has signs of hypoglossia, anky loglossia, cleft palate, malocclusion with normal teeth, epicanthal folds, low set and rotated ears. She also has oligodactyly hands and feet. Chromosomal study of peripheral blood lymphocytes confirmed the 46,XX karyotype.

Peters plus syndrome is related to mutations in the B3GALTL gene, localized on chromosome 13 (q12.3q13.1), leading to the inactivation of the B1 3glucosyltransferase. In this study, we screened the B3GALTL gene in six patients, from four un related families, with typical Peters plus syndrome. We reveled inter and intra familial phenotype variation. However the novel homozygous c.597 2 A>G mutation was identified in all patients suggesting an effect founder of this mutation. Functional study using an ex vivo approach showed that this mutation causes complete skipping of exon 8 in the B3GALTL cDNA, which altered the open reading frame of the mutant transcript and generated a PTC within exon 9. This finding potentially elicits the nonsense mRNA to degradation by NMD. All these data confirm an important role of the B3GALTL gene test that pro vides diagnosis confirmation and improves genetic counseling for the fami lies.",2014

While PTHS appears to be a recognizable clinical entity,it seems to remain underdiagnosed principally when characteristic dysmorphic features are less typical due to similarities with other known genetic syndromes (Rett, Angelman).PTHS is an autosomal dominant condition caused by haploinsufficiency of the TCF4 gene on 18q21.2. The molecular abnormalities identified in more than 100 patients include 40% of point mutations, 30% small deletion or insertion and 30% of partial or total gene deletions. We report on a 25 year old boy with severe intellectual disability,absent language, ataxic gait, anxiety and agitation, dysmorphic fea tures and smiling appearance. Due to the lack of the hyperventilation and the presence of atypical dysmorphisms, we decided to start genetic investigati ons by array CGH (Bluegnome LTD, 44K feature whole genome). The result was a loss of 103Kb on 18q21.2 spanning from 53,045,402 bp to 53,149,037 bp (hg19) within the TCF4 gene. This gene has 20 exons (the first and the last non coding), with several isoforms reported. Our deletion includes exons 4 6(NM_001083962) and is predicted to result in a frameshift. At our knowledge, this is the second one described in literature involving these 3 exons.

There was no deletion in the 11p region suggesting that the ring was formed by fusion at 11q24.2 with 11ptel region. This inter pretation was validated by FISH using 11q25, 11ptel and 11qtel probes. Our genotypic results could explain the short stature, compulsive behavior and ADHD, as well the early onset hypertension (associated with KCNJ5 gene) compatible with JBS. However, his phenotype does not include thrombocy topenia (related to FLI 1, ETS 1 and NFRK3 genes) or kidney abnormalities (KCNJ1 and ADAMTS15 genes).

Abnormalities of the central nervous system are the most common in the structure of the serious fetal pathologies (1,4%), followed by abnormali ties of the cardio vascular system (0,87%), osteomuscular system anoma lies (0,51%), abnormalities of renal system (0,64%) and digestive system (0,6%).Conclusion: Genetic counseling and prenatal diagnosis methods (fetal ultra sound, biochemical screening, karyotyping) helps to reduce up to 50% of the frequency of chromosomal abnormalities and congenital malformations to newborns.",2014
22666,"Background: Following the WHO recommendations in 2012, the National Collaborative Perinatal Neonatal Network (NCPNN) in collaboration with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Ministry of Public Health (MOPH) inaugurated the establishment of a national Birth Defect (BD) surveillance program. A previous study conducted on 19 Lebanese hospitals, members of the NCPNN, between 2003 and 2007 had shown an incidence of 3.25% of BDs in neonates with a significantly higher oc currence in consanguineous mating. This is our preliminary data on BDs in Lebanon, from May 1st to November 30, 2012. Methods: Infants born with major BDs from hospitals across Lebanon were reported. Incidence of BDs was calculated using data provided from the MOPH. Results: 464 in fants born with a major BD were reported. The overall rate was 18.2/1000 live births. The most common were musculoskeletal defects (4.2%), mainly clubfoot (24.3%), central nervous system defects (4.01%), mainly spina bi fida (40.2%) and cardiovascular defects (3.29%), with septal defect accoun ting for 29.7%. Facial/neck defects represented only 0.63%. Among infants with spina bifida, 8.3% of the mothers were on folic acid before pregnancy while 36.1% started it after conception. Among infants with clefts, 64.1% of the mothers reported smoking exposure during pregnancy. 30.8% of all mothers were overweight/obese before pregnancy. Parental consanguinity was reported in 33.4% of the cases; among those, 53.2% were first cousins. Conclusion: Ascertaining the prevalence and determinants of BDs through proper surveillance would lead to preventive measures contributing to a measurable reduction of BDs in our country.",2014
22667,"In recent years a few patients with perisylvian polymicrogyria associated with arthrogryposis have been reported. The underlying genetic cause of this condition is not yet known. We report on a newborn male whose pregnancy was characterized by the detection of arthrogryposis, bilateral club feet, micrognathia, and a small VSD on prenatal sonogram. The patient was born full term: BW 2673 g (5 th centile), BL 46 cm (5th centile), OFC 34 cm (20th centile). Physical examinati on at birth showed minor facial anomalies, proximal and distal contractures of the upper and lower limbs consistent with arthrogryposis multiplex con genita, lack of palmar and plantar creases, and bilateral talipes equinovarus. A brain MRI evidenced bilateral perisylvian polymicrogyria. Family history was not contributory. The SNP array [Affymetrix Cytoscan HD microarray (average resolution of 50 Kb for deletions and 400 Kb for duplications)] showed a microduplica tion of 825 Kb in chromosome 14q12 (29.372.798 30.197.863, hg 19) and a microdeletion of 420 Kb in chromosome 7p22.1 (4.743.281 5.163.491, hg19). The duplication contains a control region for the FOXG1 gene. The de letion contains several genes associated with muscular function, including FOXK1. The interpretation of this result is still unclear, and analysis of the parents is pending. We will proceed with exome sequencing if neither of the chromosomal imbalances are considered to be causative. In conclusion, we propose that the association between perisylvian polymi crogyria and arthrogryposis is a novel discrete phenotype. The results of the genetic analysis will allow better insight into the molecular etiology of this recently described entity.",2014

Progressive loss of cell cycle control is an im portant feature on the colorectal cancer. p21 (CDKN1A/CIP1/WAF1), one of the cyclin dependent kinase inhibitors, plays a key role in regulating the cell cycle. The aim of this study was to investigate associations of the CDKN1A gene polymorphisms (rs3176336,rs1801270,rs762624) with risk of colo rectal cancer (CRC) in an Iranian population. Methods: The study subjects were 150 cases of colorectal cancer and 150 controls for any polymorphisms. Genomic DNA was extracted using stan dard salting out method. Genotypes were determined using the polymerase chain reaction and restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR RFLP) method. Results: A significant relation was found between rs1801270 in the CDKN1A gene and colorectal cancer. The distribution of AC genotypes among spora dic CRC patients was more frequent than that in the control group (P value , 0.003).We found no significant difference between studied polymorphismS and colorectal cancer .

22671,"As an essential element for human life, iron is widely involved in many im portant metabolic processes, such as DNA synthesis, electron transport, and oxygen delivery. Numerous studies have found a positive correlati on between iron storage and risk of cancers such as hepatic cancer, renal cancer and lung cancer(LC). Solute carrier family member 2(SLC11A2) is the only transmembrane iron transporter known to be involved in cellular iron uptake. Mutations in SLC11A2 gene are associated with hypochro mic microcytic anemia with iron overload. One of SLC11A2 gene variants, 1303C/A, occurs in the coding region of SLC11A2 and results in an amino acid change from leucine to isolecine. Due to the role of SLC11A2 in iron regulation, 1303C/A mutation in SLC11A2 gene (rs144863268) was in vestigated in 100 subjects (LC patients: n,50; healthy controls: n,50) by method of PCR RFLP . The resulting 362 bp amplification products were digested by SfaNI and were analyzed by electrophoresis in a 2% agarose gel. The 1303C/A mutation destroys a SfaNI site. Accordingly mutant alleles showed only the undigested, 362 bp band, whereas wild type alleles were identified on the basis of a digestion pattern showing a 197 and a 165 bp band. No significant differences in allele (A allele ÃÂÃÂ²,0.91, p,0.338; C allele ÃÂÃÂ²,1.01, p,0.315) and genotype (ÃÂÃÂ²,2.70; p,0.259) frequencies of the gene polymorphism were found between the healthy controls and lung cancer patients.

22672,"Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is characterized by a number of features that requires accurate diagnostic and specific treatment approach. The t(15;17)(q24;q21) which generates the PML RARA fusion transcript presents the diagnostic hallmark of AML. PML RARA positive patients express one of three hybrid transcripts within PML gene and are denoted bcr1 (long), bcr2 (variant), and bcr3 (short) forms. The importance of specific breakpoint re gion is its utility as prognostic factor for individualÃ¢ÂÂs likelihood of relapse and possibly their response to therapy treatment. In this study we present detection of the most uncommon breakpoint regi on, bcr2, by RT PCR technique. We analyzed 95 pediatric AML patients and examined the incidence of three most frequent fusion transcripts obtained by standardized RT PCR protocol (European BIOMED 1 Concerted action). In 28 cases, positive for one of the AML rearrangement, 9 patients (32%) had AML1 ETO rearrangement, 3 (11%) had CBFB MYH11, and 16 (57%) had PML RARA. Among 16 PML RARA patients, five (42%) were presented as bcr1 positive (multiplied with PMLA1 RARAB primers) and showed non specific extra band multiplied with bcr3 primers (PMLA2 RARAB). These results are interpreted as bcr2 positive, but to ultimately determine whether it is bcr1 or bcr2 transcript, we are now investigating length of these pro ducts by sequencing. After these analyses we will determine the rate of bcr2 products among our patients. Cytogenetic analysis from bone marrow samples showed normal karyotype. Establishment of bcr2 rearrangement is important because of its decreased response to treatment with all trans retinoic acid (ATRA) depending on where the break occurs within PML exon 6.ABSTRACTS PUBLISHED ABSTRACTS ESHG 2014 | MILAN, ITALY | WWW.

Identification of chromosomal aberrations, as well as cryptic genome lesi ons is important for precise diagnosis and risk assessment. The aim of our study was to determine the most frequent clonal chromosomal aberrati ons, to assess their prognostic value and to compare the results obtained by classical cytogenetics and by array CGH. Bone marrow aspirates were collected from 21 patients diagnosed with AML and from 8 healthy blood donors. The material was divided into two parts. One part was used for classical cytogenetic analysis (GTG banding and RHG banding) and FISH. The second part was used for DNA isolation and array CGH analysis. Chro mosomal abnormalities detected by classical cytogenetic techniques most often relate to chromosomes: 5, 17 (24%), 8, 15, 16, 18, 21 (19%), 3, 7, 11, 14, 20 (14%), 4, 12, 13 and 22 (9,5%).

The t(8;21) translocation occurs in 5 12% of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cases, and in 40% of AML FAB M2 type, with well defined and specific mor phological features. Over 70% of patients show additional chromosome ab normalities: loss of Y or X chromosome in half cases. Variant translocations involving a variable third chromosome account for approximately 3 4% of all AML M2 with fusion transcripts. Although the t(8;21) is easy to recogni ze cytogenetically, rearrangements between 8q22 and 21q22 may be mas ked with complex or cryptic translocations.

To date, the Breast Cancer Information Core Database (BIC) contains more than 3000 different sequence variations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes. We have found the same mutation in different patients associated to the oc currence of different cancer at a different age, therefore to date it is not pos sible a specific genotype phenotype correlation.

Early identification of individuals at risk allow to implement protocols and periodic clinical surveillance for certain risk profiles.",2014
22683,"Breast cancer is the most common cancer diagnosed in women worldwide and 7% of all breast cancer cases occur in women under 40. Only 5 10% of all breast cancer have genetic predisposition and the number of women in the general population with breast cancer attributable to mutations in highly penetrance genes BRCA1 And BRCA2 is very low. These observations have led to the proposal that breast cancer susceptibility is largely polygenic and recent GWAS studies have identified some regions in the genome which contains SNP that can involved risk of developing breast cancer including FGFR2 (rs2981852) and miR146 (rs2910164). Moreover, several SNPs at the BRCA1 gene such as c.2731C>T (rs7999917), c.3232A>G (rs16941), c.3667A>G (rs16942), could modify the risk. We studied 124 women un der 40 with breast cancer divided in two main groups: patients who car ried pathogenic mutation in BRCA1/2 genes (BRCA+ n,22) and noncarriers (BRCA n,102). DNA was extracted from peripheral blood and allelic discri mination was performed using TaqMan SNPGenotyping Assay. We found a significant association between genotype TT in the FGFR2 polymorphism and BRCA+ group (OR,0,133 CI95%,0,026 0,687p,0,024 ).

22684,"Solid tumors are characterized by considerable interindividual and intratu moral genetic heterogeneity. High genetic variability of breast cancer (BC) probably manifested in the presence of various types of structures of in filtrative component (morphological structures): tubular, trabecular, solid, alveolar and discrete groups of tumor cells. It may be assumed that different types of morphological structures are manifestations of phenotypic diver sity, which is based on a set of specific cytogenetic differences. The aim of this study was to investigate intratumoral cytogenetic variation in BC and its relationship with the morphological subtypes of breast cancer. Material for analysis was taken from single patient with breast cancer. We isolated five morphological structures from two regions of breast cancer with laser microdissection (PALM, Carl Zeiss, Germany). Analysis of chromosomal ab errations was performed using Agilent microarrays (SurePrint G3 Cancer CGH + SNP Microarray Kit, 4x180K). The number of identified unbalanced chromosomal aberrations in the various structures ranged from 24 to 270. While the least amount of rearrangements found in tubular structures and the largest in solid. The cluster analysis results indicate that the samples from different types of histological structures obtained from the same re gion of tumor clustered together rather than between similar cellular phe notype across the tumor. Furthermore, number of common chromosome aberrations between different tumor regions was not higher in samples with similar morphology than in samples with different morphology. It is suggested that similar histological structures may originate from cell clones with different karyotype.",2014

Germ line mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes are the primary cause of up to 5 10% of breast cancer incidence. To reduce increased risk of developing cancer or to increase the likelihood of early detection, carries of BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations are offered surveil lance programs and effective preventive medical interventions. This study aimed to investigate the contribution of BRCA mutations to breast cancer cases in Uzbekistan. 67 patients with breast cancer as well as the sex and age matched control group of healthy individuals (n,103) were included in this study. By means of real time allele specific PCR we analyzed DNA samples of these groups for the presence of BRCA1 5382insC, BRCA1 4153delA, BR CA1 185delAG, BRCA1 300T>G and BRCA2 6174delT mutations. 3 unrelated samples (4.5%) were found to be positive for the heterozygous 5382insC mutation representing a possible founder mutation in the Uzbek popula tion.

The list of patients diagnosed with BC was taken from the Cancer Registry (2009 2013) of University Hospital, Pleven. One hundred and seventy five women with BC were interviewed and pedigree was constructed for each of them. The patients were classified into ten categories, according to personal, disease and family history. Based on the selective criteria we defined a tar get group of 79 Bulgarian women with BC.

Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women worldwide. The evalua tion of the expression of estrogen receptors and progesterone and HER 2 has become essential for the treatment of patients bearing breast cancer since it provides information of prognostic and therapeutic order. The pur pose of this study was to evaluate the expression of hormone receptors and Her 2 protein in breast cancer , study the correlations between them and with other prognostic factors, compare our results with those in the literature and evaluate our immunohistochemical technique . This is a pro spective study of 130 cases of breast cancer diagnosed at the Laboratory of Pathology of the University Military Hospital and Regional Oran ( HMURO ) since the year 2006 until 2009. The evaluation of the expression of hormone receptors and HER2 by immunohistochemistry was performed . ERs are ex pressed in 64% of cases, PR in 71% of cases and HER2 in 31 % of cases. The correlation between the percentage and intensity of marking the RE and RA was statistically significant . On PR , they were correlated with age but not with tumor size or lymph node status with .

22691,"In primary breast cancer, hormonal receptor status is very useful in predic ting response to endocrine therapy and prognosis. Negative ER, PR cases have limited therapeuting options, so it is very helpful to identify biomar kers that can be used as targets for the new targeting therapies, or can be used for prognostic value. We studied 623 tissue samples from operable pri mary breast adenocarcinomas and 101 of them had negative receptor sta tus. From these 101 cases 52.3% was c erbB2 positive vs 27.3% of the total amount, and the HER 2 gene was amplified in 36.6% vs 16.8% of the total cases. p53 was expressed in the 59.5% of the negative ER cases vs 26.6% of the total amount. The expression of the stem cell markers was almost identi cal in positive and negative ER cases, except of cd24 which was expressed in 25%vs80% respectively (p0.02) of the cancer cells of this group. According to our results the positivity of c erbB2 is higher in negative cases and many of the negative c erbB2 immunohistochemically cases show amplification of the gene, proposing that herceptin may be a benefit in these cases. The high percentages of the p53 and cd24 expression shows that this group of cases tends to have poorer prognosis, as cd24 is expressed in the more primitive mammary stem cells. A CISH or FISH test is recommended for this group, whatever the c erbB2 result of the protein is, in order to give the oncologist more detailed information about the biological behaviour of these cancer cells.",2014

Our study aims to compare familial breast cancer (FBC) patients with sporadic breast cancer (SBC) and to evaluate the hormonal status, immuno staining for Her 2/neu, and Her 2/neu and TOP2A copy number alterations by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). Twenty two patients with inva sive breast cancer were involved: 12 positive for the criteria of FBC. Sections of formalin fixed paraffin embedded blocks were subjected to immunostai ning for Her 2/neu (Hercep test), estrogen receptors, progesterone recep tors and FISH for Her 2/neu and TOP2A genes copy number alterations. Pa thological parameters and immunohistochemical markers proved that FBCs were more aggressive than SBC. TOP2A gene amplification was observed in 25% of FBCs compared with 20% of SBC patients. Co amplification of both Her 2/neu and TOP2A genes were observed in 8.3% of FBC patients and in 20%SBCs. In contrast, Her 2/neu amplification was observed in 25% of FBCs compared with 10% of SBCs.

22694,"Introduction: Testis specific genes which has normal expression in restric ted tissues, contains a subgroup demonstrating expression in various mali gnancies known as Cancer Testis Antigen (CTAs). Considering testis as an immune privileged organ, aberrant expression in cancers could cause spon taneous humoral and cell mediated immune responses. Breast cancer is a promising target for vaccination and immunotherapy using CTAs. Methods and material: We analyzed the expression of 4 CTAs, PEPP 2, ODF4, ACRBP and SPATA19 in 40 samples of invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC), adjacent normal tissue and 10 fibroadenomas, as well as MCF 7 and MDA MB 231 cell lines using RT & Real Time RT PCR. Results: ACRBP was expressed in normal tissue. SPATA19 expression was not significantly different in normal and cancer tissues. ODF4 and PEPP 2 were expressed in 62.5% and 22.5% of IDC samples respectively. Real Time results showed increased expression of ODF4 and PEPP 2, 2.96 (p<0.001) and 3.31 (p<0.01) times in IDCs samples, respectively in comparison with testis tissue. Both genes were up regulated in MCF 7 and MDA MB 231 cell lines compared with normal testis sample.

22695,"Background: CD44 is a member of the cell adhesion molecules family. In normal cells, CD44S, along with CD44V3 and CD44V6 play roles in cell moti lity, migration, and adhesion, while in tumor cells they are involved in tumor invasion, progression, and metastasis. The aim of this study was to evaluate the expression of CD44S, V3 and V6 in esophageal squamous cell carcino ma (ESCC) and their correlations with clinicopathological features of the patients. Methods: The expression of CD44S, V3 and V6 was compared in tumoral and distant tumor free tissues of the esophagus in fifty ESCC patients using comparative real time PCR. Results: A significant overexpression of CD44S, V3 and V6 mRNA was ob served in 13, 11 and 9 tumor specimens, respectively. The co expression of the genes (S&V3) were significantly associated with grade of tumor differen tiation, stage of tumor progression, and depth of tumor invasion and (S&V6) with grade of tumor differentiation and (V3&V6) with grade of tumor diffe rentiation, stage of tumor progression and depth of tumor invasion. Conclusion: Our finding suggested that the reduced expression of CD44 v6 is associated with invasion and stage of tumor and the level of CD44V3 mRNA expression was associated with tumor invasion. In addition, Simulta neous expression of these genes has an important role in tumor prognosis. Investigating the potential role of alternative splicing in cancer progression may therefore lead to the development of novel therapeutic interventions.",2014

Therefore it is unclear whether Y occurs as normal age related event or it is a marker of neoplastic clone. The aim of our study was to review molecular cytogenetic findings in bone marrow cells of patients with oncohematological diseases and to assess the role of the Y loss during malignant process. We found loss of the Y chromosome in bone marrow samples of 142 males (median age 72 years, range 21 89 years) with myeloid or lymphoid disor ders. The most frequent diagnosis was myelodysplastic syndromes and acu te myeloid leukemia (54 patients). All samples were analyzed by conventio nal G banding and by interphase FISH. Cut off level for FISH was established at 10% and the extent of cell clones with Y loss varied from 12 to 98%. Most of the patients (131) showed a clone with Y at the time of diagnosis. In 114 cases Y loss was the sole abnormality and in 17 patients it was associated with autosomal structural and/or numerical aberrations. In 11 patients Y clone was detected during the progression of the disease. As quoted in the literature (Van Dyk, 2001) the presence of >75% cells with Y is associated with the malignant disease.

22698,"Renal cell carcinoma is the most common neoplasm affecting the adult kid ney. One of the most frequent events in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (cc RCC) is inactivation of Von Hippel Lindau gene (VHL). A series of studies recently demonstrated that a number histone modifying and chromatin remodeling genes, including SETD2, have mutation in ccRCC. Furthermore, SETD2 gene is within a 50 Mb region on chromosome 3p that encompasses VHL and is deleted in ~90% of ccRCC. The goal of the study was to investigate inactivation of VHL and SETD2 ge nes by mutations. We studied 105 DNA samples of tumor tissues and normal renal parenchyma in ccRCC patients from Bashkortostan Republic of Russia, using PCR, SSCP and direct sequencing. Mutations in VHL gene were found in tumor tissues with the frequency of 21,9% (23/105). We detected 22 muta tions in 23 ccRCC patients, including 8 point mutations (35%), 13 deletions (60%) and 1 insertion (5%). Ten somatic mutations hadnÃ¢ÂÂt been described in literature previously. VHL inactivation through sequence alterations in tumor DNA didnÃ¢ÂÂt differ by histopathologic characteristics or occupational exposure. Analysis of SETD2 gene was performed in 50 ccRCCs DNA samples and matched normal tissues. According to literature, mutations in SETD2 gene are detected in 4 15% cases of ccRCC. In our research SETD2 gene mutations were not found. This may be due to an insufficient number of samples in the investigated cohort.

Inversions constitute %10 of all structural chromosome aberrations and generally had no phenotypic effects. In inversion carriers, depending on which chromoso me or segment are involved, the risk of reproductive wastage increase. Here we reported a 43 years old female patient with Ph chromosome and additive chromosomal abnormalities which has been diagnosed in CML. In the analyses performed using BCR ABL1 FISH probe into the bone marrow interphase cells, %12 of the cells were normal, %20 had classical fusion, in %68 of the cells increased ABL signals were present giving rise to complex rearrangements.

C MYC proto oncogene is one of the most frequently activated onco genes, and is estimated to be involved in 20% of all human cancers. To evaluate MYC copy number and its protein expression, CISH and IHC ana lyses were performed in 50 gastric adenocarcinomas among Iranian indi viduals. 29 samples showed low amplification, 9 and 12 samples showed moderately and high amplification, respectively. MYC immunoreactivity was observed in 27 samples. In 31 samples either MYC amplification or MYC im munoreactivity were observed. 19 samples showed low amplification and were negative IHC. Among 31 samples, 9 samples showed low amplificati on, 8 and 14 samples were moderately and high amplification, respectively. Among 31 samples, 9 samples had strong signal, 16 samples moderately signal, 2 samples poor signal and 4 samples negative signal for IHC. The ma jority of patients with IHC negative had low amplification. Therefore, C MYC amplification was correlated with the C MYC protein overexpression. This study showed that there was amplification in early gastric cancer and could be used as a therapeutic target. Therefore, this will contribute to early diagnosis, therapeutic and prognosis of gastric adenocarcinoma.",2014
22703,"BackgroundThe life time risk for colorectal cancer (CRC) in the Swedish population is approximately 5 % with a mortality second only to that of lung cancer. It is estimated that 5 % of all CRC develop in individuals with a Mendelian predisposition for the disease, for example Lynch syndrome (LS), familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP), MUTYH associated polyposis (MAP), juvenile polyposis syndrome (JPS), Peutz Jeghers syndrome (PJS) or PTEN hamar tomatous tumor syndrome (PHTS). However, diagnose selective genetic screening fails to detect a disease causing mutation in the majority of pati ents with suspected hereditary CRC. AimThe SWedish Extended genetic analysis of hereditary colorectal Neoplasia (SWEN) is a prospective national study involving researchers and clinically active staff at the cancer genetics clinics in Sweden with the overall aim to improve genetic testing and the care of patients and families with genetic susceptibility for CRC. Material and MethodsSix hundred adult patients with clinically suspected Mendelian CRC of any type are offered mutation screening of the 11 genes associated with LS, FAP , MAP , JPS, PJS, PHTS and additional selected candidate CRC susceptibility genes. Genetic and clinical data for each family is registered in a national database followed by genotype phenotype correlation studies. Current StatusThe study is ongoing since February 2014 and inclusion of patients will con tinue for at least three years. SignificanceThe results from the SWEN study should improve genetic testing, personali zed risk estimation and effectiveness of surveillance programs for individu als with hereditary predisposition for CRC.",2014

This syndrome is characterized by the pre sence of hundreds to thousands of adenomatous polyps in the colon and rectum. An attenuated form of FAP , called attenuated familial adenomatous polyposis (AFAP), is related to mutations in the 5Ã¢ÂÂ end, in exon 9 and in the 3Ã¢ÂÂ end of the APC. In addition, biallelic mutations in MUTYH gene have also been identified in patients with colorectal adenomas and in APC negative patients with FAP or AFAP .Molecular analysis in APC performed to 50 Spanish families diagnosed with FAP (n,38) and AFAP (n,22) has allowed the identification of pathogenic mutations in 85% of FAP families and 21% of AFAP . In total, we found 22 pathogenic mutations: 7 were nonsense and 13 were frameshift (7 deleti ons, 3 duplications, 2 insertions and a deletion together with an insertion). Ten of these mutations are reported in this work for the first time. We have also detected two novel splicing mutations. In this study, we detected 6 va riants of unknow significance and we performed population based studies, segregation studies and In Silico studies to further define these mutations. In patients who showed no point mutations in the APC gene were analyzed for large rearrangements by multiplex ligation dependent probe amplifica tion (MLPA).Analysis of MUTYH revealed 6 pathogenic mutations in 8 unrelated families: 7 biallelic and 1 monoalellic variants.

The mutations found (Table 1) generally correlate with the most abundant alterations in colorectal cancer. A K367E mutation in exon 9 of the FGFR2 gene was found with low burden (8 11%) in the tumors of 3 patients. This is a novel mutation that results in AA substitution in the extracellular juxtamembrane region and might initi ate spontaneous dimerisation of the receptor, leading to factor independent growth and hyperresponsiveness to ligand, as suggested for similar defects in endometrial cancer and patients with craniosynostosis syndromes. Having in mind the low burden of the va riant, we believe that K367E mutation is a late event alteration in a subclone which may be responsible for the highly aggressive pattern of the disease.

Bladder cancer represents the second most common genitourinary tumor, with approximately 390,000 new cases every year worldwide. Mutations in the FGFR3 and TP53 genes have been shown to define two divergent pa thways in the pathogenesis of bladder urothelial carcinomas. The purpose of this study was to perform molecular screening for FGFR3 and TP53 mutations in 243 bladder tumors and to assess the relation of clinicopathological variables with mutation status of these two genes. Muta tions in the FGFR3 and TP53 genes were detected by SNaPshot method and PCR single strand conformational polymorphism analysis followed by DNA sequencing, respectively. FGFR3 mutations were identified in 115 (47.3%) specimens and TP53 al terations were found in 46 (18.9%) tumors. In 12 cases (4.9%), FGFR3 and TP53 mutations coexisted; in 94 cases (38.7%), neither mutation was found. Analyses of nonmuscle invasive and muscle invasive tumors alone revealed that FGFR3 and TP53 mutations were independent events (p,0.76 and p,0.11, respectivelly). An inverse correlation between mutated FGFR3 and mutated TP53 was observed: FGFR3 mutations were strongly associated with low stage (p<0.001) low grade (p<0.001) tumors, whereas the fre quency of TP53 mutations was significantly higher in tumors of higher stage (p<0.001) and grade (p<0.001). Moreover, the presence of metastasis was strongly associated with TP53 mutations and the lack of FGFR3 alterations. Our data are consistent with the idea that FGFR3 and TP53 mutations repre sent two distinct mechanisms of bladder cancer development.

Gastric carcinogenesis is a complex, multistep and multifactorial process, in which many factors are implicated. Genetic factors play an important role in the development of gastric cancer(GC). Recent studies have shown that single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in several genes are associated with increased GC risk, indicating that genetic variation contributes to ga stric carcinogenesis. Located on chromosome 8q24.2, the prostate stem cell antigen (PSCA) gene encodes a 123 amino acid glycoprotein related to the cell proliferation inhi bition and cell death induction activity. SNPs in PSCA gene have been found associated with gastric cancer risk in a genome wide association study. This association has been replicated in several populations, but also there are some conflicting results. This study aimed to investigate the association between polymorphic vari ant of PSCA gene(rs2294008) and susceptibility to gastric cancer in Uzbe kistan. 105 patients with gastric cancer and the sex and age matched control group of healthy individuals (n,116) were included in this study.

BACKGROUNDAutophagy is an adaptive and highly regulated response in unfavorable con ditions such as starvation. During this process, long lived proteins and orga nelles are self eaten by double membranes vesicles, called autophagosomes, which transport them through the cytosol to the lysosome, where they will be degraded. The resulting macromolecules can be recycled to the cytosol for reuse. Autophagy plays an important role in cellular development and differentiation and it has been reported that its malfunction is implicated in several diseases including cancer. Glioblastoma is a very infiltrating and ag gressive heterozygous glioma. Its behavior is directly related to their genetic and chromosomal alterations. Here, we have analysed common polymor phisms in autophagy genes in order to evaluate the role of these variants in modulating glioblastoma risk.

Between March 2013 and January 2014, 77 bone marrow samples were analyzed cytogenetically from adults aged between 23 and 82 years. Where possible three independent cultures (direct method, 24 and 48 hours) were established and a minimum of 20 metaphases were analyzed. The karyotype of 70 patients was analyzed successfully. For 7 patients with insufficient number of metaphases FISH analysis was performed using BCR/ABL1plus probes (MetaSystems). Complementary specific FISH probes (Me taSystems) were used according to clinical hematological diagnosis for 5 pa tients with normal karyotype. Among the successfully karyotyped samples, 35 cases of CML, and 3 cases of ALL showed various homogeneous or mosaic chromosome abnormalities. The most common abnormality was the presence of the Philadelphia chro mosome (Ph), found in varying percentages (between 9 and 100%) with 2 cases having an additional cell line with double PH chromosome. One case had a complex translocation involving chromosomes 9, 10 and 22. Other common abnormalities were trisomy 8, isochromosome 17, autosomal hy per and hypodiploidy. Identification of cytogenetic abnormalities by conventional karyotype is im portant to confirm the diagnosis and provide useful information for classi fication, staging and prognostic information, for choosing therapy conduct and for signs of remission or relapse. Because some cases show a normal karyotype by conventional banding, FISH and aCGH analysis are valuable techniques recommended for identifying the presence of possible submi croscopic abnormalities.",2014

Background: Over expression of the proto oncogene cerbB 2 (HER 2/neu) has been shown to be a prognostic marker and also a target for therapy in many cancers but conflicting data exist about the prevalence of HER 2/neu over expression in SCC of the head and neck. Design: The status of Her 2/neu was evaluated in a series of 36 SCC of the la rynx and oro pharynx to verify the frequency of over expression of HER 2/neu and evaluate the correlation with traditional diagnostic parameters of this neoplasm. A Hercep test kit was used to detect HER 2 expression, and a Path Vysion kit was used for gene amplification. Results: On immunohistochemical (IHC) staining HER 2/neu was positi ve only in 8 cases (8/36) and these were further tested by fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) with positive gene amplification in 3 cases (3/8), cep17/Her 2/neu , 4.22 4.84.

In this study, our goal was to perform the genetic analysis of 2 pati ents (index patients) who had been selected by colorectal cancer features, and to identify the genetic changes in the MCR region at the APC gene. Me thods: Mutation analysis of the MCR, which spans codons 1286 1513, was performed on the paraffin embedded cancerous tissue samples using ma crodissection, nested PCR and direct sequencing of purified PCR fragments. Results: In our study 2 new somatic mutations detected in these patients .In one patient we have detected a CGA to TGA as a Nonsense mutation that lead to Arg to premature Stop codon at the 4507 nucleotide position (Codon 1503) and in another patient , we describe a GÃ¢ÂÂA Transition (ACG to ACA) at nucleotide position 4638 in exon 15 (MCR region) which causes a silent mutation since both normal and mutated alleles encode a Thr residue at codon 1546.

Several genome wide association studies (GWAS) have identified loci lo cated at 15q25 (IREB2 ) and 4q22 (FAM13A ) associated with chronic ob structive pulmonary disease (COPD) and lung cancer (LC). Dysfunctions of IREB2 gene, as a regulator of iron homeostasis, may lead to oxidative failu res, relevant in pathogenesis of lung diseases. FAM13A gene is involved in modulation of RhoA molecule activity, suggesting both anti inflammatory and tumor suppressor function. The aim of our research was to determine the association between IREB2/FAM13A polymorphisms and Polish COPD and LC patients. We have examined four variants in IREB2 (rs2568494, rs2656069, rs10851906, rs13180) and three in FAM13A (rs1903003, rs7671167, rs2869967) among 149 COPD, 468 LC patients and 524 con trols, using TaqManÃÂ® genotyping assays. The frequency of AA genotype/A allele of IREB2 rs2568494, were significantly higher in LC cases compared with controls (P,0.0081, P,0.0043). The FAM13A rs2869967 was signi ficantly associated with COPD and combined COPD with LC+COPD group (CC genotype: P,0.0007, <0.0001; C allele: P,0.0009, 0.0001, respectively). The rs1903003, rs7671167 FAM13A variants confers a protective effect on COPD (both P<0.002). Haplotype based tests identified significant asso ciation between the IREB2 AAAT haplotype and LC cases (P , 0.0021). The FAM13A TTC haplotype was associated with an increased risk of COPD and COPD with LC+COPD group (P,0.0013 and P,0.0003, respectively).

As established in other Lynch syndrome associated cancers, these skin lesions demonstrate loss of mismatch repair (MMR) protein expression on immunohistochemical (IHC) staining, allowing tar geted germline mutation analysis of the MMR genes associated with Lynch syndrome (MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, PMS2). However, not all lesions with loss of MMR protein expression will result in a molecular or clinical diagnosis of Muir Torre or Lynch syndrome, as this protein loss may be due to a sporadic mechanism. There is emerging literature that the specific type of sebaceous lesion, along with its location on the body, can provide an indication as to which lesions are more likely to have loss of MMR protein expression and subsequent association with Muir Torre/Lynch syndrome.

It occurs in both hereditary (25%,hMTC) and sporadic (75%,sMTC) forms which are associated with gain of function mutations in the RET pro to oncogene. Material and methods: We have started MTC genetic screening since 2001. Our study included 360 individuals, including 161sMTC, 39FMTC, 8MEN2A, 3MEN2B, 4pheochromocitoma (215 index cases), and 145 relatives. Geno mic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood leukocytes, and the six exons of the RET gene (10, 11, 13, 14, 15, 16) were amplified by PCR and examined by DNA sequence analysis to detect mutations. Results: A total of 20 different types of missense RET mutations were iden tified in 78 patients. All of the MEN2A patients had mutations in codon 634. Mutations outside of codon 634 occurred only in FMTCs and sMTCs. A mu tation at codon 918 was found in all MEN2B patients. p. C634Y was the most common mutation in our study followed by mutations p. C630Y, p. C634R, p.634S. The G691S/S904S haplotype was identified in 120 patients and 70 relatives. A novel C>T intronic variant (intron 11, chr position 10:43612012) was also detected. Conclusion: Exon 11 and after that exon 10 were the most frequently mu tated exons of RET proto oncogene in MTC patients in our population. As about half of patients with the hot spot mutations had the G691S/S904S haplotype simultaneously, further analysis needs for clarifying the effect of multiple risk alleles in MTC development.",2014

Most melanomas have chromosome copy number abnormalities. Fluorescent In Situ Hybridization (FISH) is an applicable technique in the diagnosis of these chromosome abnormalities and so its usability is emerging in mela noma diagnosis. The aim of this study was to evaluate the diagnostic role of the FISH in the assessment of malign melanomas and melanocytic nevi. Histologically evaluated most suitable formalin fixed, paraffin embedded (FFPE) tissue sections of 25 malign melanoma tumors and 25 melanocy tic nevi samples were analysed for copy number abnormalities of CCND1, MYB, RREB1 and centromere of chromosome 6 but no FISH result could be obtained from a tumor tissue. Copy number abnormalities were detected in 20 malign tumors (83.8%) and four melanocytic nevi (16.0%) and stati stically significant differences were seen between the tissues for each gene (MYB deletion and RREB1/CEP6 p<0,05 , RREB1 amplification p<0,01 and CCND1 amplification p<0,001). Histopathologic features of the melanocytic nevi tissues with gene copy number abnormalities were similar to the cha racteristics of malign melanomas and they had had premalignant diagnosis.

22739,"Introduction Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia type 2A (MEN 2A) is a complex autosomal dominant inherited syndrome characterized by medullary thyro id carcinoma (MTC), pheochromocytoma and primary parathyroid hyper plasia. In patients with only one or two clinical features, identification of a germ line RET (RE arranged in Transfection) mutation on chromosome 10 or the identification of the clinical features of MEN 2A in other first degree relatives is required to make the diagnosis. Methods We analyzed blood DNA from 4 Iranian families with three generations of MEN2A including 22 affected persons with MTC and 10 with pheochromocytoma. RET hotspots were amplified in probands and sequenced for mutation detection. RFLP test was used for identification of mutations in family members. For fidelity analyzing of used RFLP test, all members sequenced. Result The causative mutation in all families was found to be Cys634Tyr missense substitution. The simultaneous presence of a functional SNP resulting in Gly691Ser was also detected in exon 11 of all the affected cases. Two known silent substi tutions and one new silent mutation was also detected in exons 10 and 13. RsaI restriction endonuclease can detect all carriers of Cys632Tyr mutati ons. Conclusion Simultaneous presence of Cys634Tyr mutation in cysteine rich region and Gly691Ser polymorphism in trans membrane domain of RET tyrosine kinase have been detected in all patients. This study shows that Cys634Tyr mutation is recurrent in Iranian patient with MEN2A and suggest the RFLP method for detection of this mutation. All asymptomatic carriers of mentioned high risk activating mutation were recommended for prophylactic thyroidectomy.",2014

Efremov, Macedonian Academy of Sciences and Arts, Skopje, Macedonia, The Former Yugoslav Republic of. Neuroblastoma is characterized by striking clinical heterogeneity, including subsets that show spontaneous tumor regression. Several acquired genetic alterations such as amplification of the MYCN oncogene, deletions of chro mosome bands 1p36 and 11q23 and unbalanced gains of 17q regions have been well characterized and shown to be correlated with tumor behavior, including response to treatment. Amplification of the MYCN oncogene iden tifies a group of patients who have a poor prognosis. The aim of our study was to evaluate the prognostic role of MYCN oncogene amplification in our cohort of children with neuroblastoma. Ten children (age 9 months to 4 years) with previously untreated neuroblastoma, were evaluated at diagno sis for MYCN gene amplification. Fresh surgical specimens were obtained during excision of the tumor or during bone marrow fine needle aspiration and analyzed using MLPA P252 kit. MYCN amplification was observed in 8 patients (4 with stage IV and 4 with stage III disease), and it was not present in the two patients with stage 2A disease. The disease was lethal in six pa tients with MYCN amplification with overall median survival of 10 months. The other two patients with MYCN amplification are alive, but with a recur rent disease. In conclusion, MLPA analysis is simple, fast and cost effective method that enabled accurate detection of MYCN amplification in our pati ents with neuroblastoma. Our study also shows that MYCN amplication is frequent event in patients with an advanced neuroblastoma and confirms it as a poor prognostic factor",2014
22741,"BACKGROUND Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) is a clonal proliferative disorder of the bone marrow characterized by ineffective hematopoiesis, peripheral blood cytopenias, and increased risk of developing acute mye loid leukemia (AML). Identifying predisposing gene mutations is critical for effective diagnosis, assessment of prognosis, and therapeutic counselling. A Caucasian family with an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern of early onset MDS was identified. No common exposures to potential carcinogens were present and clinical genetic testing indicated that regions 5q31 and 7q22, frequently associated with sporadic MDS, were not causal, suggesting an inherited predisposition. METHODS/RESUL TS In depth genetic analysis was undertaken. Six samples were acquired, including four clinically affec ted males across 2 generations (age of onset 25 69; one RAEB MDS, two unclassified MDS, one unknown MDS), a suspected unaffected female family member (aged 40), and an unaffected spouse (aged 72). Single nucleotide polymorphism genotyping was performed on the suspected unaffected and three affected individuals. Data was analyzed using a haplotype mapping technique for autosomal dominant disorders. Using a cut off of 3cM, affected individuals were found to share 89 genomic regions. Whole exome sequen cing on two affected individuals, combined with the mapping data, revealed 1904 shared variants in those regions. FUTURE DIRECTIONS Whole exo me sequencing on a third affected individual is underway to reduce the list of potential causative variants. After analysis, variants will be prioritized based on the genes known function and mutation severity. Top candidate genes will be sequenced in all available family members to determine which variant(s) track with the disease. ABSTRACTS PUBLISHED ABSTRACTS ESHG 2014 | MILAN, ITALY | WWW. ESHG.

22742,"Bladder cancer is known to be modulated by environmental carcinogens. Polymorphisms in the genes coding for the enzymes involved in the meta bolism of carcinogens are considered as susceptibility factors for bladder cancer. N acetyltransferase 2 (NAT2) is a Phase II enzyme of the xenobio tic metabolism pathway, which is involved in detoxification of arylamines and heterocyclic amines. Therefore, polymorphisms of the NAT2 gene and its related acetylation status may confer a risk factor for the development and progression of bladder cancer. In this study, we have investigated NAT2 481C>T , 590G>A and 857G>A polymorphisms, corresponding to NAT2*11A, NAT2*6B and NAT2*7A alleles, in terms of bladder cancer risk. For this pur pose, genomic DNA samples of 129 bladder cancer and 148 healthy subjects were genotyped by PCR RFLP upon their informed consent. We have shown that NAT2*11A allele have a trend for protection against bladder cancer (p,0.059; OR,0,761), and significance of protection increases (p,0,005; OR,0,539) when non smokers are excluded. We also categorized the indi viduals according to their acetylation status as slow, intermediate and fast acetylators, however, we could not find a statistically significant asscociati on between bladder cancer and acetylation status.",2014

Thus, medical personnel represent the group most consistently exposed to low doses of IR. Many cytogenetic studies have been conducted among hospital workers ex posed to IR. The cytokinesis blocked micronucleus (CBMN) assay is widely used, since it represents a reliable test to assess radiation induced chromosme damage and itÃ¢ÂÂs a valuable biomarker in many biomonitoring studies on human po pulations exposed to IR. The aim of our study is to assess chromosomal damage in Tunisian hospital workers occupationnally exposed to low levels of IR. The CBMN in peripheral lymphocytes of 67 exposed workers compared to 43 controls. The clastogenic/aneugenic effect of IR was evaluated using the CBMN assay in combination with flurescence in situ hybridization ( FISH) with pan cen tromeric DNA in all the exposed subjects and controls. The centromere analysis performed in our study showed that MNs in hos pital staff were predominantly centromere negative and the mean negative labeled micronucleus (C MN) frequency was significantly higher in the ex posed subjects than in the controls ( 9.04ÃÂ±4.57Ã¢ÂÂ° vs. 1.17ÃÂ± 0.77Ã¢ÂÂ°).

22744,"PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homolog) localized on chromosome 10q23.3 is tumor suppressor, which mutations cause both hereditary and sporadic forms of malignancies, including ovarian cancer (OC). The first germinal mutations in this gene have been identified in the study of hereditary syn dromes: Cowden, Bannayan Riley Ruvalcaba and Lhermitte Duclos. PTEN is negative regulator of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway by dephosphoryla ting phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5 triphosphate to phosphatidylinositol 4,5 bisphosphate thus counteracting PI3K function. The operation of PTEN is necessary to control apoptosis, migration and proliferation of cells in the organism. We carried out an analysis of structural changes in the PTEN in 250 patients with ovarian cancer from different ethnic groups of the Republic of Bashkor tostan. The detection of mutations was performed by high resolution mel ting curve analysis (HRM) and confirmed by direct sequencing. The study of nucleotide sequence of the PTEN in patients with OC were detected chan ges: c.904A>C (Ser302Arg), c.217G>A (Glu73Lys), previously described polymorphism c.132T>C (Gly44Gly), and changes in introns: c.209+9G>C, c.209+10T>C. Using the program Polyphen 2, we have found that the change c.904A>C, lo cated in exon 8 of PTEN, is not pathogenic, and therefore does not contribute to the development of ovarian cancer. Mutation c.217G>A (Glu73Lys), loca ted in exon 4 of PTEN, is found in phosphatase domain of protein PTEN that may possibly affect the impaired function of the protein and subsequently lead to tumor formation.

Noninvasive diagnostic biomarkers emerges as a possibility to perform a safe diagnosis, preferably early in the disease course. Recently, microRNAs (involved in the initiation and maintenance of tumors, and able to discriminate the presence or absence of certain diseases) were discove red as stable molecules in circulating samples. We evaluated the expression levels of six miRNAs (miR 21, 34a, 155, 196a, 200b and 376a) in serum (24 PDAC and 9 healthy patients) and saliva (10 PDAC and 10 healthy pati ents) samples. The aim of our study was to investigate the presence of dia gnostic and/or prognostic biomarkers. Expression levels were measured by relative quantification using qRT PCR. In serum, miR 21 and miR 34a were significantly more expressed in samples from patients with PDAC (P<0.001 and P,0.001) and both were able to distinguish patients with and without disease with clinically acceptable sensitivity and specificity (AUC for miR 21 and miR 34a of 0.894 and 0.865). We also found a strong and positive correlation between the expression levels of these two miRNAs in serum (r s,0.681; P<0.001; Kappa tests: 0.477; P,0.022). However, the mechanism related to this correlation remains unknown. In salivary samples, generally, miRNA levels were very low.

Recent studies suggest important role of both environmental and genetic factors in cancerogenesis. 3 Phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase (3 PHGDH) gene overexpression is assosiated with patoge nesis of human cancer and contributes to cell proliferation. Aim: The objective of our study was to assess the association of PHGDH gene polimorphism in group of males with thyroid gland cancer and control group of healthy men. Methods: The survey was carried out in the Department of Human Genetics Medical School, University of Belgrade. The study has encompassed 80 man diagnosed with thyroid gland cancer in Center for Endocrine Surgery, Clini cal Center of Serbia Serbia and 100 health males volonteers. The DNA was isolated from the periferal blood with solting out method. The genotypes 3 PHGDH polimorphism were determined by Polimerase Chain Reaction and Restriction Fragment Lenght Polimorphism. Gel electrophoresis was used to separate DNA fragments. Results: There was a significant difference in frequency of TT , CT and CC betweenexperimental and control groups of rs541503 polymorfism (Hi2, 38.924; p,0.001). There weresignificantly more TT in experimental group, while in control group therewere more CT (Hi2,33.186; p,0.001) and CC (Hi2,21.734; p,0.001).

The goal of the study is the analysis of PIK3CA hotspot mutations and their correlation with clinicopathological parameters. Paraffin embedded tissue sections were obtained from biopsy specimens of 95 breast cancer patients characteri zed histologically and immunohistochemically including histological grade, regional lymph node status (pN), estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor and HER2 status. We investigated exon 9 and exon 20 of PIK3CA gene in 95 breast tumor samples by DNA sequencing. We observed mutations in 27.3% (26/95), all with exception of 2 cases were mutually exclusive. Mutations in exon 9 represent 16.8% (16/95); mutations in exon 20 represent 12.6% (12/95). We observed associations between mutations and the histopatho logical characteristics of the disease. In exon 9, we detected E542K (5/16), E545K (9/16), Q546K (2/16) missense changes. These mutations showed significant correlation with lower grade (p,0.0074) and pN status without metastases (p,0.0415). Mutations in exon 20 H1047R, H1047Y and G1049R were associated with higher age of patients (p,0.0249). The E545K mutati on correlated with lower grade (p,0.0013) and with pN status (p,0.0232) particularly; the H1047R mutation was significantly more frequent in lobu lar type of breast cancer (p,0.0354). We have shown that the mutations in exon 9 of PIK3CA were associated with favorable prognostic factors. The PI3K signaling pathway plays a critical oncogenic role in the development of human breast cancer and the prevalence of its dysregulation advocates its potential as a feasible therapeutic target.",2014

The application of the following molecular markers: DD3 over expression, GSTP1 promoter hypermethylation, TMPRSS2 ERG gene fusions and mutations in androgen receptor (AR) gene for diagnostic purposes was assessed. We attempt to correlate the molecular data to both histological and clinical data. The obtained molecular profile in the three Bulgarian pati ents coincides with the clinical and histological data of aggressive, hormone independent PCa. There was no association between the tumor stage (as sessed by TNM as T2) and the detected molecular profile of aggressive can cer behaviour. None of our cases was with positive family history and no so matic mutations were detected in the AR gene. The rest of the markers: DD3 overexpression, GSTP1 gene promoter hypermethylation and TMRSS2 ERG fusion were positive in fresh prostatic tissues and biopsies from all three patients, whereas only one blood sample showed triple positive result. The appearance of PCa specific molecular markers in blood was considered as a predictor for a pronounced migration and dissemination of prostatic tumor cells in circulation.

Genes expression was analyzed by real time PCR with endogenous GAPDH and tissue specific KLK3 controls. There was a correlation between the grade in normal/low /high PIN/adenocarci noma and expression of PCA3 (r , 0,691). The threshold ÃÂCt(PCA3 KLK3) 3,9 provided optimal sensitivity and specificity in biopsy: 86% and 96%, respectively.

However, the identity of aberrant splicing variant (detected by RT PCR from patientÃ¢ÂÂs blood) and even the segregation of mutation in family was not so obvious. Recently, other research group found no aberrant mRNA in their patient carrying the same mutation (2). In our patient, we did not detect any splicing aberration in the blood derived mRNA, nor we did see any diffe rence in splicing when using our hybrid minigene system specialized for the analysis of the last introns/exons splicing. Furthermore, the mutation does not clearly co segregate with the disease in our patientÃ¢ÂÂs family, being detec ted in the unaffected fatherÃ¢ÂÂs side of family whereas the motherÃ¢ÂÂs affected side could not have been examined. In conclusion, we propose that this mu tation should be regarded rather as benign or with uncertain effect on gene expression and HDGC development. Nonetheless, further investigations of mRNA from the affected tissue might be helpful. References: 1) More H, Humar B, Weber W, et al.

22758,"ERBB1 , MYC , Her2/neu, and Top2A oncogenes are known to be involved in the development, prognosis and response to the therapy in breast cancer. We extracted DNA and RNA of 81 primary sporadic breast cancer tumor tis sues and 30 normal breast tissues. IHC, MLPA, RT PCR and FISH techniques were used. The Her2/neu gene showed the most significant correlation bet ween amplification and overexpression in 23 patients. The concurrent in crease in amplification and overexpression for Top2A gene was statistically significant. ERBB1 and MYC, showed no correlation between their amplifica tion and overexpression. Significant concordance between co amplification of Her2/neu and Top2A genes was detected. The amplification of Her2/neu gene was associated with negative progesterone receptor state, higher gra de of the tumor, and increase in MVD; the overexpression of the gene was concordant with negative hormone receptor state and higher grade and sta ge of the tumor. The amplification of MYC was seen more in younger patients (<50yr) and was correlated with higher cell proliferation factor (KI 67). The amplification of TOP2A was detected more in stage 3 tumors. Co ampli fication of MYC HER2 genes and co overexpression of TOP2A HER2 genes were detected more in higher grade and stage tumors; co overexpression of TOP2A HER2 genes were related to higher MVD. The rate of co amplification of MYC ERBB1 genes was higher in tumors greater than 5 cm. In conclusion, besides HER2 gene, the amplified TOP2A and MYC genes have crucial role in predicting the prognosis of the patients; the co amplification and co overex pression of these genes with HER2 gene have significant prognostic roles.",2014
22759,"Objectives: Human epidermal growth factor receptor (HER) status is an important prognostic factor in breast cancer. There is no globally accepted method for determining HER2 status, and which method is most precise is still a matter of debate. Methods: A total of 93 Iranian women with sporadic invasive breast cancer were studied. We analyzed HER2 mRNA expression by quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT PCR) and HER2 DNA amplification using multiplex ligation dependent probe amplification (MLPA). To assess the accuracy of the RT PCR and MLPA techniques, a combination of IHC and FISH was used, substituting FISH when the results of IHC were ambiguous (2+) and for those IHC results that disagreed with MLPA and qRT PCR and named it IHC FISH. Results: The correlations between IHC FISH and qRT PCR or MLPA were 0.945 and 0.973, respectively. The ASCO/CAP guideline IHC/FISH correlati on with MLPA was (0.827) and with RT PCR was (0.854).The correlations between the IHC results (0, 1+ as negative, and 3+ as positi ve) and qRT PCR and MLPA techniques were 0.743 and 0.831, respectively. Conclusion: Given the shortcomings of IHC analysis and greater correlations between MLPA, qRT PCR, and FISH methods than IHC analysis alone with each of these three methods, we propose that MLPA and real time PCR are good alternatives to IHC. However a suitable cut off point for qRT PCR is a prerequisite for determining the exact status of HER2.",2014

Recently, Microarray expression data revealed that the expression level of Stanniocalcin was higher in tu mors. Regarding the need for novel prognostic biomarkers, in place of the existing routine histopathological methods in early screening and the choice of therapy options in Colorectal Cancer (CRC), we examined Stanniocalcin 2 expression levels in patients with CRC and assessed their association with clinicopathogical data. We examined the mRNA expression levels of Stannio calcin 2 in CRC in 48 tumor tissues and 48 marginal tissue samples using re al time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT PCR). Clinico pathological data of patients were collected after fulfilling criteria and the pathological evaluation of their tissue samples. STC2 mRNA expression le vels were higher in tumor tissues than the control marginal groups. (r,0.36, p,0.02).

RET mutations have an important role for diagnosis and confirming MTC. The most common mutation follow in the exons 10, 11,and 14 16. In this study some others exons examined in MTC patients. Material and methods: 298 participants were included, 196 patients (111 female, 85 male) and 112 relatives (58 female, 54 male). Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood leucocytes and nucleotide change detection of exons 2, 3, 5, 8, 12, 17, 18 of the RET gene was performed by PCR and direct DNA sequencing methods. Results: A total of 10 different nucleotide substitu tions were identified. There was not found any SNP in exons 5 and 8. One missense mutation (R982C) in exon18 and three synonymous mutations (A45A, V125V, G733G) were found in exons 2, 3, and 12 respectively. A novel C>T intronic variant (intron17, chr position 10:43620286) was also found. Conclusion: This study was focused on some RET gene exons that did not consider comprehensively before. It seems, molecular screening of the RET gene in MTC patients should not be limited to hotspot exons. Probable de leterious, protective, and/or additive effects of these SNPs with or without RET hotspot mutations in MTC development remained to be clarified.

22763,"The tumor suppressor gene TP53 and its regulator MDM2 are both key play ers involved in multiple pathways including apoptosis, cellular transcrip tional control, and cell cycle regulation. Common germline polymorphisms in these genes may affect colorectal cancer susceptibility. An arginine to proline substitution at codon 72 in the p53 gene is reported to decrease apo ptotic potential, while a thymine to guanine polymorphism at nucleotide 309 (named SNP309) of murine double minute 2 MDM2 gene increases its transcription. These two polymorphisms therefore may be of importance in colorectal carcinogenesis. The relation of these polymorphisms to colorectal cancer in the Algerian population was addressed in this study. DNA samples from 121 controls and 116 cases were genotyped for these two polymorphisms by PCR/RFLP then confirmed by sequencing. Unexpectedly no significant association was found between this potenti al marker TP53 Arg72Pro and CRC (p>0.05). However, our findings reveal that individuals with the MDM2 SNP309 GG genotype have a low risk of CRC (OR,0.49; 95% CI, 0.24 0.98, p,0.04) relative to the TT genotype and with more significance in females (OR, 0.16; 95% CI,0.06 0.41, p<0.05). Moreo ver, no significant association was observed between the combined TP53 and MDM2 genotypes and colorectal cancer. Contrary to initial expectations that the GG genotype with high MDM2 levels will increase cancer risk, our results demonstrate that the MDM2 SNP309 GG genotype is associated with decreased risk of colorectal cancer. This is suggesting that other mechanisms independent of increased MDM2 levels can influence cancer susceptibility.",2014

The aim of the study was to evaluate the frequency of 17p UPD in bone marrow cells of patients with newly diagnosed MDS and complex karyotypes and to assess correlation of 17p UPD with mutations of tumour suppressor gene TP53 located at 17p13.1.Bone marrow samples from 49 patients were analyzed by aCGH/SNP (Blue Gnome) and UPD of 17p was found in 7 of them (14%). All cases had dele tion of 5q and additional recurrent chromosomal aberrations: 7q deletion (4x), monosomy 7 (1x), or 12p deletion involving ETV6 gene (5x). Average extent of 17p UPD was 14 20 Mb involving TP53 gene. In all 7 cases with 17p UPD, two copies of TP53 gene were detected by FISH (Abbott). DNA iso lated from bone marrow cells of 5/7 patients was NGS sequenced (Roche) and in all of them homozygous TP53 mutations were found. Our study confirmed that acquired UPD 17p is a recurrent cytogenetic defect in patients with MDS with complex karyotypes and is strongly associated with homozygous mutations of TP53 gene. This lesion is cryptic unless ana lyzed by SNP array. UPD might have a fundamental role in tumorigenesis, therefore further characterization of 17p UPD will lead to better understan ding of the initiation and progression of MDS.

Although, the initiator/initiators of uterine leiomyoma are unknown, seve ral predisposing factors such as age, nulliparity, obesity and genetic factors have been identified to be contributed to the pathogenesis of the disease. In regards to genetics factors contributing to uterine leiomyoma, a few studies have investigated the role of GSTM1 gene polymorphisms and incidence of uterine Leiomyoma. However, further studies are needed to clarify the ef fects of genetic variations in uterine leiomyoma. Therefore, this study was carried out to investigate the associations between GSTM1 null genotype and uterine leiomyoma in Iranian population. Methods: In this case control study, blood samples were collected from 50 women with uterine leiomyoma and 50 healthy controls. Genomic DNA was extracted and GSTM1 gene polymorphisms were detected using Gap PCR. Allelic and genotypic association was evaluated by Chi square and FisherÃ¢ÂÂs exact tests. Results: The frequency of GSTM1 null genotype was significantly different (p , 0.01) in cases (42%) compared to controls (18%). In addition, the re sults indicated that the presence of GSTM10/0 genotype increased risk of uterine leiomyoma in case group compared to control group (OR: 3.56; CI 95%: 1.35 9.37; p , 0.01).

In about 50 % of Ã¢ÂÂsporadic Ã¢ÂÂ cases of Retinoblastoma no constitutive RB1 mutations can be identified. Recent research suggests that, at least in some of these cases, somatic mosaicism of RB1 can be found. The increased availa bility of Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) technology improves our ability to detect the exact percentage of patients with RB1 mosaicism. Using NGS we re tested a series of 42 patients with sporadic Retinoblastoma. Twelve patients had constitutive mutations, in apparent heterozygosis, that were identified according to traditional techniques, whereas 30 patients had no mutations. Among the 30 patients with no mutations, NGS identified the mutation in a Ã¢ÂÂmosaic stateÃ¢ÂÂ, varying between 8 and 27% in 3 cases. Among the cases with apparent heterozygosis according to traditional methods, mutations in a mosaic state varying from 3 to 28% were found in 100 % of cases when, in addition to blood samples, it was possible to test more than 3 tissues ,i.e. ocular tissue, urine and/or oral mucosa. Present results con firm that 10 % of patients with sporadic retinoblastoma with no apparent mutations in RB are actually cases with low rate mosaicism.

By differentia ting PDCs with stepwise p53, Rb/p16INK4a, and K RasG12D mutations, we present a model that readily permits high throughput cDNA microarray analysis of invasive gene signatures for personalized targeting. Specifically, populations of human PDCs in different chronologic and phenotypic stages of neoplastic formation and murine PDCs isolated ex vivo from inflamed, regenerative, or neoplastic Pdx1 Cre; LSLKrasG12D/+ pancreata were ac quired. RNA was extracted and its cDNA was analyzed on genotypically fo cused, invasion specific microarray plates. As expected, K RasG12D was the overwhelming driver of upregulated, invasive genes within the phenotypic and histologic neoplastic populations. Indeed, genes associated with cancer stem cells and necessary for PDCs to escape the ECM (metalloproteinases, tenascin c, vitronectin and CD44) were induced 2.5 to 35 fold based di stinctly on unrestricted K Ras signaling. Uniquely however, when PDCs were stratified to pathologic stage (inflamed, regenerating, neoplastic) or muta tional iteration (p53 ÃÂ± Rb/p16INK4a ÃÂ± K RasG12D), there was substantial variation in the gene signatures regulating invasive potential.

Background: Brain tumours, especially glioblastoma multiforme is an aggressive cancer characterized by extensive glioma invasiveness. Matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) 9 have been implicated to play a critical role in this process. Methods: In the present study we analyzed the expression of MMP9 mRNA in 59 gliomas (astrocytomas and oligodendrogliomas) and 14 nonneoplastic brain tissues. MMP9 gene expression was detected by real time quantitative RT PCR assay. Results: The expression level of MMP9 mRNA in glioma tissues was significantly higher than that in corresponding nonneoplastic brain tissues. MMP9 was observed with high expression level in 36 out of the 59 (61%) glioma tumours. Overall survival rates of patients with high MMP9 mRNA expression were obviously lower (12 months) than the patients in the other two groups the median survival was 48.7 and 22.9 months for the down regulated and normal MMP9 mRNA expression, re spectively (p< 0.001). The increased expression of MMP9 mRNA was also significantly correlated with low Karnofsky performance score (p, 0.001). Multivariate analysis showed that high MMP9 mRNA expression was an in dependent prognostic factor for glioma patients (p, 0.002). Conclusion: Our results indicate that the overexpression of MMP9 mRNA is closely as sociated with poor clinical outcome. It may be used as specific prognostic biomarkers and for the future could be molecular targets in the treatment of malignant gliomas.

22775,"We previously reported the MLH1 S131X as founder mutation in patients with the Lynch syndrome from Macedonia. The mutation has a high pene trance with different time of disease onset ranging from 32 to 55 years. We speculated that this variability might in part result from a leaky nonsense mediated decay (NMD) of mutant transcripts, which results in a truncated protein and dominant negative effect in patients with a more severe disea se. Herein, we present in vivo expression data of the S131X mutation in PBMCs and 3 tumors of 2 patients with the time of onset at the age of 33 and 49. Since both patients were also heterozygotes for the common I219V polymorphism, the output from each allele was analyzed by measuring the relative amounts of transcripts containing either I219 or V219 by direct se quencing of PCR amplified cDNA. The mutant transcripts in the patient with the later onset of the disease were completely absent in the 2 synchronous tumors (stomach and colon), whereas in the patient with an early onset of the disease they were present in a significant amount (50%) both in the tumor and in PBMCs, indicating the presence of leaky NMD. Having in mind that we previously detected a variable amount of normal transcripts from alleles with splicing mutations in patients with ÃÂ²+ thalassemia, we suggest that inter individual variability in the capacity for posttranscriptional pro cessing of mutant transcripts is a general mechanism which influences the clinical severity of inherited diseases resulting from truncating mutations.",2014

In the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, it ranks number one in terms of incidence as well as cancer related mortality in fe males. Although the age standardized incidence rate for breast cancers in Saudi Arabia is 3.4 fold lower compared to United States, the median age of onset is 47 years, significantly lower than 62 years observed in patients from United States. Amplification of the two oncogenes: Her 2/neu and c myc and deletion of the tumor suppressor gene p53 are frequently encoun tered in breast carcinomas. Our objective was to evaluate the association between Her 2/neu, c myc, p53, and clinicopathologic variables in breast cancer patients using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). FISH analy sis for Her 2/neu, c myc, and p53 was performed on 60 samples with bre ast carcinomas and 22 samples with benign breast lesions. Amplification of HER 2/neu was seen in 7/60 (11.7%) cases and amplification of c myc was seen in 11 of 60 (18.3%) cases; neither was associated with adverse clinicopathologic variables or survival. Deletion of p53 was seen in 29/60 (48.3%) cases and was associated with poor histologic grade, compared to the benign group. There was impact of genetic alterations on overall survi val and disease free interval.

22777,"Hemolytic due to hemolysis, the abnormal breakdown of red blood cell (RBCs), either in the blood vessels (intravascular hemolysis) or elsewhere in the human body (extravascular). It has numerous possible causes, ranging from relatively harmless to life threatening. The general classification of hemolytic is either inherited or acquired. Treatment depends on the cause and nature of the breakdown. Symptoms of hemolytic anemia are similar to other forms of anemia (fatigue and shortness of breath), but in addition, the breakdown of red cells leads to jaundice and increases the risk of particular long term complications, such as gallstones and pulmonary hypertension. In the present study, the V. cholerae were tested for their ability to cause he molyis. The WT caused an excessive destruction of RBCs. However, several V. cholerae mutants did not hemolyse the chicken RBCs as the WT did. The genes that caused the reduction of hemolytic activity could not be determi ned as the mutant strains carried multiple gene mutation. In the previous study, hly gene was reported to cause hemolyis. Hly gene is repressed by hap, which is expressed late in infection.",2014
22778,"K. Ammosov North Eastern Federal University, Yakutsk, Russian Federation, Russian Federation. It is suggest a hypothesis, that replication creates a new form of chromatin, which exists from G2 period of interphase to telophase. The replication dou bles of DNA, but the amount of nucleosomic histones in the nucleus remain the same as before replication in G1 period. Therefore daughter nucleofi laments of G2 period have twice less histones than before replication. This is a new post replicative semihistonal form of chromatin, Ã¢ÂÂsemichromatinÃ¢ÂÂ. Helix formation and condensation are important structural properties of se michromatin. They are responsible for the formation and development of the chromosomes. It is known that helix formation and condensation latst in the chromosomes during of prophase metaphase. Consequently, the chromosomal material is represented semichromatin of the nucleus all this time. The hypothesis shows that the nucleus doesnÃ¢ÂÂt contain a stock of free histones, and a nuclear pores canÃ¢ÂÂt pass quickly all histones of cytoplasm in a nucleus. The cytoplasmal histones reach of semi hromatin of chromosomes only after the destruction of the nuclear mem brane in prometaphase. They gradually double the number of histones of semichromatine of chromosomes in a anaphase telophase and return it into full for histones threadlike chromatin, ie nucleofilamenty. Thus, replica tion creates a semihistonal form of chromatin and it is the reason of forma tion of chromosomes. Synthesis of new histones in cytoplasm fills histones semichromatin and return in full histones chromatin, i.e. synthesis of new histones is the reason of disappearance semichromatin and chromosomes from view a light microscope.

Therefore we have investigated the genotoxic effect of methyl mercury chloride (MMC; CH3HgCl) at two concentrations (100, and 1000 ÃÂ¼g/L) and the role of ascorbic acid (Vitamin C) at a single concentrati on of (9.734 mm) on MMC treated short term human lymphocyte cultures. We assessed the chromosomal aberrations (CAS), sister chromatid exchange (SCE) and COMET assay in control and MMC treated lymphocyte cultures with and without Vitamin C supplementation. The results showed that MMC has increased the frequency of CAS and SCE/cell in a dose dependent man ner than control values. CH3HgCl also, induced DNA damage in determined by COMET assay. These effects were prevented by the addition of Vitamin C to MMC treated lymphocyte cultures.

The importance of the effects of ionizing radia tion is to increase the risk of cancer or genetic defects. The most reliable method of biological dosimetry, is analysis of chromosomal modifications radiation induced, particularly, the dicentric chromosomes, in lymphocytes of peripheral blood. For this purpose, we established two calibration curves Dose/effect, by the methods of cytogenetic in uniform staining. The selected experimental conditions are the same as those used by the team of Pr J,F. BARQUINERO (University Autonomy, Barcelona, SPAIN). The first was esta blished like witness, from the blood of a Spanish person. As for the second, it was conceived for the Algerian laboratory from a blood sample of an Al gerian person, without history to exposure to radiations. The frequency of dicentric chromosomes increases as dose and the statistical analysis shows that the values obtained follow a Poisson distribution revealing thus that the irradiations were correct and homogeneous. The two curves obtained from the dicentric analyses, obey the quadratic linear model and the relati on Dose/effect is expressed by the equation: Y , C + ÃÂ± D + ÃÂ² D2 .This study has allowed us, in Algeria to establish a dose effect curve for bio dosimetry laboratory, which could in the future be part of an international biodosimetry network",2014

The main dysgonosomies are represented by Klinfelter syndrome which includes the presence of at least one extra X chromosome in a masculine karyotype 46, XY and Turner syndrome, which is linked to the complete or part absence of X chromosome. Monosomy X is not the only form of this syndrome. In half cases we find mosaic and / or structural abnormality of the X chromosome and sometimes the Y. Other less frequent dysgonosomies are represented by Double Y, Triple XXX , Men XX and Women XY. We report our first series collated between October 2009 and Marsh 2014 at the unit of medical genetics and Oncogenetics CHU Hassan II Fes. Many abnormalities found: Klinfelter syndrome (n: 9), Turner syndrome (n: 21), 12 cases with chromosomal formula (45, X), 3 cases of mosaic, 4 cases of isochromosome of the X long arm and 2 cases of Turner syndrome with the Y.

In addition, RA as a natural mor phogen guides posterior patterning in embryo neural development. Based on these two scenarios the aim of this study was to define if there was any revenue for PML NBs in RA dependent neural development. For this reason, RA was used as a neural inducer for in vitro neural differentiation of mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs). In mESCs, neural precursor cells (NPCs) and neural cells (NCs) obtained from this differentiation process Pml mRNA and protein levels were assessed by quantitative real time RT PCR (q RT PCR) and western blotting. qRT PCR results showed that Pml had a maximum ex pression in mESCs and this expression clearly had decreased in NPCs and NCs, although no significant differences existed between two latter groups. Interestingly, three un foresight protein bands about 170, 130 and 70 kDa similarly were detected in these cell types on western blots.

Bardet Biedl syndrome (BBS) is a rare autosomal recessive ciliopathy cha racterized by obesity, postaxial polydactily, retinitis pygmentosa, mental re tardation and kidney abnormalities. At least 18 genes have been shown to be associated with BBS, therefore genetic testing for this disease is highly complicated. We consulted a family with strong clinical features of BBS in 2 children. While considering the labor and consumables costs for analysis of at least 7 Ã¢ÂÂcommonÃ¢ÂÂ BBS genes (BBS1, BBS10, BBS2, BBS6, BBS9, BBS12 and BBS13), we opted for exome sequencing as a viable alternative to multiple single gene tests. Using Illumina MiSeq platform, we identified homozygous BBS7 L656fsX673 (c.1967_1968delTAinsC) mutation in 2 affected sibs; both parents and their healthy son were heterozygous for this allele. Presence of an identical gene defects in non consanguineous parents is uncommon for BBS, however Russian population was repeatedly shown to have an unu sually pronounced founder effect.

Using Haloplex, a novel sequence capture method combined with benchtop non optical next generation sequencing we were able to achive short turn around time with the screening of 16 genes that could be associated with an increased risk of breast, ovarian and other types of cancer. The analysis of this 16 gene set can explain the inherited back ground of almost 30% of hereditary and familiar cases of breast and ovarian cancers. Thus, it opens up a high throughput approach with fast turnaround time to the genetic diagnostics of these disorders and may be helpful to in vestigate other familial genetic disorders as well.",2014
22797,"Objective: The presence of cell free DNA (cfDNA) in plasma/serum of non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients demonstrates promising clinical im plications as the minimally invasive liquid biopsy for diagnostic, prognostic and predictive applications. To date, we performed quantitative evaluation of cfDNA in plasma of NSCLC patients and non malignant controls. Me thods: Plasma cfDNA concentration and integrity index (DII) were measu red by real time PCR in 60 NSCLC patients (stage I IIIA), 100 patients with chronic respiratory inflammation (COPD, sarcoidosis, asthma), 15 patients with non malignant lung nodules (hamartoma, fibrosis, tuberculoma) and 40 healthy volunteers. Results: NSCLC patients presented significantly hig her plasma DNA levels (8.0 ng/ml) than patients with chronic respiratory inflammation (3.4 ng/ml) and healthy controls (2.3 ng/ml; p<0.0000), but not than patients with non malignant lung nodules. The ROC analysis pro vided 90% sensitivity and 80.5% specificity in discriminating NSCLC from healthy individuals, while 56% specificity and 90% sensitivity in distinguis hing NSCLC from any non NSCLC subjects (p<0.0001). Similarly, the mean DII in NSCLC (4.0) significantly differed from healthy control values (1.0; p,0.000), but not from DII in chronic respiratory inflammation (3.7) and non malignant nodule group (4.0). During 3 6 month follow up plasma DNA level were significantly reduced in relapse free NSCLC patients (2.8 ng/ml), while in relapsed subjects were higher than at baseline. Conclusions: The plasma DNA quantification, though insufficient for routine NSCLC detection, is still superior to diagnostic accuracy of conventional serological markers. Epi /genetic alteration analysis might improve the diagnostic power of cfD NA. Long term post operative plasma DNA level follow up might prove pro mising in monitoring of radical NSCLC therapy.",2014
22798,"Lysosomal storage disorders (LSDs) are a group of disorders that enclose the damage of an enzyme and its pathological consequences due to the ac cumulation of substrate in lysosomes. In Colombia, LSDs are misdiagnosed because many of them are not widely known. A biomarker is defined as a molecule that works as an indicator of disease, being useful for a diagnostic approach. Chitotriosidase (ChT) is a chitin hydrolyzing enzyme that clea ves the 1,4 ÃÂ² linkage of chitin. In human its function has not been entirely elucidated, but its increase has been associated with inflammation, fungal/parasitic infection or LSDs. We propose ChT as a reliable biomarker for the diagnostic approach to LSDs in Colombia. We took DBS samples from 240 patients (112 females and 128 males) with Pompe, Fabry, Metachromatic Leucodystrophy, Mucopolysaccharidosis, Mucolipidosis, Gaucher, Niem mann Pick (NP), Gangliosidosis GM1 or Sialidosis, who were previously dia ABSTRACTS PUBLISHED ABSTRACTS ESHG 2014 | MILAN, ITALY | WWW.

We present our experience with using CMA for postnatal and prenatal diagnosis in Estonian patients during 2009 2013. Since 2011 CMA is on the official service list of the Estonian Health Insurance Fund and is performed as the first tier cytogenetic test for patients with DD/ID, MCA or ASD. A total of 1902 patients were analyzed, including postnatal [1692 (89%) patients and 106 (6%) family members] and prenatal referrals [104 (5%) fetuses]. Abnormal results were reported in 500 (26%) patients, with a total of 585 findings (1 5 per individual): 217 (37%) deletions, 174 (30%) duplications, 176 (30%) long contiguous stretches of homozygosity (LCSH) events (>5 Mb), and 18 (3%) aneuploidies. Of all findings, 230 (39%) were defined as (likely) pathogenic; for 271 findings (46%), most of which were LCSH (159), the clinical significance remained uncertain; 80 (14%) reported findings were classified as likely benign. Clinically relevant findings were detected in 201 (11%) patients. However, the proportion of variants of un certain clinical significance was high (46% of all findings) demonstrating that the interpretation of CMA finding remains a rather difficult task.

22800,"Introduction: Chromosomal abnormalities are important prognostic factors in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). During the course of the disease clonal evolution (CE) may occur. CE, defined as acquisition of new cytoge netic aberration, is associated with shorter overall survival. In the majority of published analyses to date, CE has been monitored using FISH. There fore, the aim of our study was to prospectively assess CE frequency using a combination of FISH and conventional chromosome banding (CBA) after stimulation with CpG oligonucleotides and interleukin 2 (IL 2). The role of other prognostic factors and therapy in development of poor prognosis CE (new deletion 17p, new deletion 11q or new complex karyotype) was also evaluated. Methods: Betweeen 2008 and 2012, 140 patients with previously untreated CLL were evaluated by FISH (deletion 11q, 13q, 17p, trisomy 12, rearrangement 14q32) and CBA after stimulation. Peripheral blood samples of each patient were provided for baseline and follow up testing. Mutation status of IGVH gene and expression of CD38 and ZAP70 were also analysed. Results: CE was detected in 15.7 % (22/140) of patients using FISH, in 28.6 % (40/140) using CBA, and in 34.3 % (48/140) of patients by combining both methods. Poor prognosis CE was detected in 15 % (21/140) of pati ents and was significantly associated with previous CLL treatment (p , 0.013). Conclusions: CBA after stimulation with CpG oligonucleotides and IL 2 provides more complex information about cytogenetic abnormalities in CLL than FISH. Many patients can acquire new abnormalities during the course of their disease in a relatively short time period.",2014

Therefore any mutation that affects its components, may influence the course and manage ment of the disease. The amplification of the EGFR gene is such significant event that is present in HNSCC. We compared the efficacy of a targeted de tection of the EGFR gene amplification with the paralogue ratio test (PRT) to results obtained with the array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH).Methods: Samples of genomic DNA extracted from tumors of 50 patients with various stages of HNSCC were first analyzed with the aCGH method. An oligonucleotide pair that maps inside the amplified EGFR region was selec ted from a collection at www.prtprimer.org and used for PRT analysis. Results: The aCGH analysis identified EGFR amplification in 7 samples, with EGFR gene copy number ranging from 3 to 6 copies. Subsequent PRT ana lysis also identified all 7 EGFR amplifications and it produced concordant results in all remaining samples which were without EGFR gene amplifica tion. Conclusion: Paralogue ratio test can be adopted for a rapid, targeted detec tion of gene amplification, such as EGFR amplification present in HNSCC, The method may be applicable as a screening tool and for conformation of aCGH results.",2014

22804,", Essex, United Kingdom. The research community needs robust and rapid sample preparation work flows for high throughput sequencing to unlock challenging samples and generate high quality sequence data. These include samples with low input amounts of genomic DNA and highly degraded tumour samples extracted from formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) material. The quality of the libraries and ultimately the sequencing data depends on the integrity of the genomic DNA extracted from FFPE samples. The forma lin fixation and paraffin embedding of tissues affects this through fragmen ting, cross linking, and otherwise damaging DNA through various chemical modifications. It is essential to assess the extent of the damage, adjust the DNA extraction procedure to compensate for the damage as much as pos sible, and adapt the sample preparation workflows to the quality of these samples. We have developed flexible FFPE specific sample preparation workflows analysis solutions for tumour/normal low coverage copy number analysis and deep whole genome sequencing. The end to end workflow from sample preparation to answer includes an upfront sample QC step enabling sample triage into three different quality bins (high, medium and low). Depending on the sample quality bin, different input DNA and size selection conditions are recommended for the sample preparation. We have also developed soft ware solutions in BaseSpace and tested third party tools for the detection of somatic variants from tumour/normal analysis, including single nucleotide variants (SNV), structural variants (SV) and copy number aberrations (CNA) data analysis.

22806,"High risk types of human papillomavirus (HR HPV) is an important cause of cervical cancers. Current cervical cancer screening guidelines suggest that early detection of HPV 16 and HPV 18 may prevent the progression of cervical cancer. We evaluated and compared three HPV DNA tests, Roche Cobas HPV, RFMP HPV Papillo Typer and Hybrid Capture 2 (HC2). Roche Cobas HPV specifically identifies HPV 16 and HPV 18 with concurrently de tecting other 12 HR HPV types and RFMP identifies 74 HPV genotypes. A total of 861 cervical swab specimens from women over 30 years of age were classified into groups of high grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL) and non HSIL according to cervical cytology results and analyzed by three assays. The results of direct sequencing or Linear array HPV genotyping test were considered true when three assays presented discrepancies. Concor dance rates between Roche Cobas HPV vs. RFMP , RFMP vs. HC2, and HC2 vs. Roche Cobas HPV were 94.5% (814/861), 94.2% (811/861), and 95.8% (825/861), respectively. In 71 specimens with discrepant results, concor dance rates between each assay and direct sequencing or Linear array were as follows: Roche Cobas HPV, 35.2%; RFMP , 93.0%; HC2, 25.4%.

In conclusion, Roche Cobas HPV, RFMP and HC2 showed high agree ment rates each other. Although Roche Cobas HPV and RFMP showed lower clinical sensitivity in detecting HSIL compared to HC2, they would be clini cally useful since both provide HPV genotypes.",2014

As early lethality is common in geneti cally engineered mice, an important proportion of homozygous mutant mice cannot be phenotyped. When the corresponding heterozygous mice have no phenotype, the effects of this mutation remain unknown. Unfortunately, stu dies in newborn mice face major difficulties due to the small size of the pups and their sensory and motor immaturity. In order to gain access to the early post natal phenotype, we developed three dedicated non invasive devices, suitable for high throughput screening: PhysioPups (patented device) is used to assess vital functions: breathing patterns, electrocardiogram (ECG), body temperature, gross body mov ements, and ultrasonic vocalizations. Four animals can be tested simultaneously under controlled conditions of temperature and gas composition. NeoGAIT is used to assess gait ontoge ny. It uses infrared detection of the animalÃ¢ÂÂs contact patterns with the floor and custom image analysis software. MemoryPups is used to assess me mory and associative learning abilities. The tests are based on olfaction and thermotactile sensitivity, the only sensory functions operating at birth. This platform has no equivalent worldwide. It allows phenotyping mice pups from the first few hours after birth until weaning.

The diseases with locus hete rogeneity are still a challenge in clinical practice and sometimes patients remain for years with unknown genetic status. In order to accelerate the establishment of proper genetic status of patients with rare diseases we analyzed exons of 552 genes underlying rare monoge nic recessive disorders using TruSight Inherited Disease Sequencing Panel (Illumina). As model we used diseases with clear unequivocal phenotype (CF, DMD) and included in the study patients in whom routine DNA testing was insufficient to obtain genetic diagnosis. The study included 4 patients: 2 with CF with identified only one mutation, 1 with DMD without deletions/ duplications in DMD gene and 1 with polymalformative syndrome including Dandy Walker anomaly, AVSD, hypoplastic genitalia, MR and facial dysmor phism. NGS revealed CFTR: p. Gly1349Asp as second pathogenic mutation in one patient with CF and DMD: p. His2921Arg in patient with DMD.

Methods: low coverage whole genome sequencing was per formed on plasma DNA samples from 175 pregnant women (8 10 weeks of gestation) for the detection of aneuplodies. Digital PCR assay was used for fetal fraction detection by quantification of RASSF1A, TERT and beta actin genes. Sequenced reads were mapped against the human reference genome hg19 by BWA. Duplicated reads were removed and unique mapped reads were counted (mapping quality > 20 was required). Read count for each chromosome was normalized based on library size and GC content. Chro mosomal aneuploidies were detected by using a z score statistics. Reference dataset was built by including euploid samples selected on the basis of the correlation between z scores and coverage in 5 aneuploid cases. This allo wed us to estimate the best trade off between coverage (> 0.4) and sample size (, 140). In the male fetuses, fetal fraction was detected by measuring normalized read count on chromosome Y.

22812,"Objective: Inflammation is the single greatest precipitator of aging and age related diseases such as, diabetes, heart disease, alzheimer, arthritis. Inflam mation, which takes place on a cellular level, is triggered by a wide variety of factors such as the oxidative stress, hormonal changes and eating a pro inflammatory diet (Hyperglycemic diet). The procalcitonin gene has pro moter sites for NF kappaÃÂ² and AP 1, factors induced under inflammatory conditions. Hyperglycemia is associated with oxidative stress and elevation of advanced glycation end products (AGEs). AGEÃ¢ÂÂs interacts the receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) and, RAGE activation is caused by elevation of transcriptional factors NF kappaÃÂ² and AP 1. These factors in duce procalcitonin gene expression. The aim of this study was to determine whether or not procalcitonin is a specific marker of aging process. Research Design and Methods: 14 type II Diabetes Mellitus (DM) patients within hy perglycemia were studied along with age and sex matched with normal nor moglycemic subjects(NNS). Blood samples were taken for measurements of procalcitoninin and analized with kryptor analizator. Procalcitonin levels were elevated in DM patients within hyperglycemia when compared with NNS. There was a statistically significant difference in serum procalcitonin of DM patients within hyperglycemia versus NNS(P<0.01). Conclusion: Our study revealed a raise in serum procalcitonin in DM patients within hyper glycemia. Hyperglycemia associated with increased circulating concentrati ons of procalcitonin may be a mechanism which explains many of the clini cal and biochemical features of aging process. Procalcitonin is a new aging biomarker which can help for discover new drugs to combat aging.",2014
22813,"Research linking genetic variants to disease has been challenging in the past, because traditional approaches are commonly limited to detecting high frequency variants within a bulk sample. This approach assumes that the sample is comprised of identical cells with the same variants. However, in the case of cancer genomics, somatic mutations accumulate over time and a single tumor can give rise to multiple sub clones. Employing a multi cell based DNA sequencing strategy to heterogeneous samples can mask low ab undant variants and make it difficult to distinguish them from sequencing errors. Sequencing the genome of individual cells, however, circumvents the problem and provides deeper insight into the molecular heterogenei ty within the cell population. The existing single cell whole genome ampli fication methods and library preparation are costly, laborious, and subject to handling errors. We have developed a method for whole genome ampli fication (WGA) of single cells using an integrated microfluidic system to au tomate the capture, lysis, and DNA amplification from up to 96 individual cells in a single workflow. Amplified products harvested from the system are ready for downstream library preparation and targeted, whole exome or whole genome sequencing. Whole genome sequencing results of a few cells indicate improvement in genome coverage, uniformity and GC bias over state of the art WGA methods.

By means of real time allele specific PCR we analyzed DNA samples of above mentioned group for the presence of 5382insC mutation in BRCA1, 6174delT in BR CA2 and IVS2+1G>A in CHEK2. 6 unrelated samples (9.1%) were found to be positive for the heterozygous 5382insC mutation representing a possib le founder mutation in the Uzbek population. We didnÃ¢ÂÂt find 6174delT and IVS2+1G>A mutations. The presented data confirm contribution of BRCA1 5382insC mutation for ovarian cancer development in Uzbek people and ta king into account a high disease penetrance in carriers of BRCA1 mutation, it seems reasonable to suggest inclusion of 5382insC mutation test in scree ning programs for breast cancer prevention in Uzbekistan.",2014
22818,"Personality traits are thought to be endophenotypes (high Harm Avoidance (HA), low Self directedness (SD)) for most psychiatric disorders and pre dictors of life outcomes. Genetic influences on personality traits are attri butable to many genes of small effect and are modulated by environmental factors. We aimed to examine gene environment (GxE) and gene gene (GxG) inter action models based on neurotrophic factor (NGF, BDNF, NTRK2, NTRK3), serotoninergic (SLC6A4, TPH1) and dopaminergic system (DRD2, SLC6A3) gene polymorphisms contributing into personality traits variation in healthy individuals. In total, 1018 healthy individuals (68% women) from Russia (mean ageÃÂ±SD: 19.81ÃÂ±2.65 years) without any history of psychopathologies were subjec ted to personality traits assessment via TCI 125 (Cloninger et al., 1993). Involved individuals are Caucasians from Russian (N,409), Tatar (N,290), Bashkir (N,130) and Udmurt populations (N,189). Socio demographic data including gender, ethnicity, order and season of birth (SOB), place of residence, level of income, childhood maltreatment were obtained. Geno typing of 70 SNPs was performed with SNPlexTM platform (Applied Biosy stems). Statistical analysis was conducted with PLINK v.1.07 corrected via FDR procedure for multiple comparisons. The present study revealed GxE models demonstrated BDNF Val66Met*SOB (PFDR,0.036), BDNF rs1519479*ethnicity (PFDR,0.042) and 5 HTTLPR*SOB (PFDR,0.05) interactions affected HA. Moreover, variations in SD were caused by interactions between BDNF Val66Met (PFDR,0.048), BDNF rs2030323 (PFDR,0.035) and ethnicity. Accordingly, genetic testing for BDNF and 5 HTT gene polymorphisms assuming gender, ethnicity and SOB confounding is necessary for psychopathologies prevention at early stages.

22819,"Familial Hypercholesterolemia (FH) is an autosomal dominant disorder caused by mutations in the LDLR, APOB and PCSK9 genes. A recessive form is caused by mutations in the LDLRAP1 gene. More than 1500 mutations have been described worldwide, with a mutation spectrum varying depending on the countries. In order to screen any population, we decided to develop a kit (SEQPRO LIPO RS) based on Next Generation Sequencing (NGS). In 2013 we launched a NGS Roche 454 based product with CE mark. We describe here part of the validation of this product in order to obtain the CE mark. Around 300 patients previously sequenced by Sanger sequencing were used to determine the analytical specificity and sensitivity of the method for point mutation (substitutions and indels), while more than 500 patients previously screened by MLPA were used to verify the ability of the method to detect Copy Number Variations (CNVs) in the LDLR gene. Reliable variant detection for up to 20 FH patients per run was achieved, with accuracy, specificity and sensitivity similar to Sanger sequencing and MLPA. This algorithm has been fully integrated in software that names the variants according to the HGVS nomenclature, and performs a search in our mutation database, while providing the variantsÃ¢ÂÂ pathogenicity status. The SEQPRO LIPO RS tool is feasible for FH detection. Moreover, it serves as a proof of principle for the development of genetic diagnostic tests for any other disease caused by both point mutations and CNVs, cardiovascular or not.",2014

The genetics research on high frequency diseases in the Republic of Sakha showed the presence of major mutations in the ge nes specific and often found among people of Yakut origin. One of the major problems for now is to do a heterozygosity screening for found mutations and to organize preventive care program. Until now there are 20 hereditary diseases can be diagnosed in the Republic of Sakha by routine methods such as PCR and restriction. Unfortunately these methods are very time consu ming. Alternative method that has been emerging rapidly is a DNA microar ray. This main advantage of this method is a possibility to screen thousands of mutations at once making the diagnostic simple and fast. In collaborati on with our colleagues from Busan National University(South Korea) there was established a testing system based on DNA microarray for the diagno stic of five high frequency diseases: Enzymopathic methemoglobinemia (OMIM 250800, Pro269Leu mutation in DIA1 gene), 3 M syndrome(OMIM 273750,4582insT in Cul7 gene), SOPH syndrome (OMIM 614800, G5741 A in NAG gene),Nonsyndromic hearing loss 1A type (OMIM220290, IVS1+1G>A in GJB2 gene), Tyrosinemia type1 (OMIM 276700 1090G>C mutation in FAH gene).

22821,"For identification the common mitochondrial 8344 A>G mutation resulting in MERRF (myoclonus epilepsy with ragged red fibers) syndrome a world wide used molecular diagnostic method is a PCR RFLP method, using the BanII restriction enzyme. So far it was not a matter of common knowledge, that it is not a trusty technique. Methods. Mitochondrial 8344 A>G mutation was investigated by PCR RFLP using BanII restriction enzyme on DNA samples (n,1073). In cases with ab normal restriction pattern mitochondrial tRNA lysin gene region (nt 8105 8536) was sequenced bidirectionally (n,14).Results. PCR and BanII RFLP analysis detected abnormal restriction pattern indicating m.8344 A>G mutation in 14 cases. Sequence analysis of tRNA ly sin gene verified the presence of the m.8344 A>G substitution only in 6 ca ses. Unexpectedly the m.8347 A>C substitution was present in 8 cases with 9 bp triplication (8272 8280) in 3 samples. The gelphoto showed nearly the same pattern in cases with m.8347 A>C mutation or 9 bp triplication. The BanII cleaves samples with m.8347 A>C and m.8344 A>G substitutions on the same way. The 8347 A>C mutation was prevoiusly not described as pa thogenic alteration, however it is a highly conserved nucelotid and has simi lar effect on the tRNALys as the 8344 A>G mutation. The 9 bp triplication is a polymorphism, its anthropological interest is controversial. Conclusion. The PCR RFLP method using BanII restriction enzyme is not a solid method for detecting m.8344 A>G mutation. It may result in pseudo positivity. We suggest to use it only as a screening method, which must be validated always by Sanger sequencing. ABSTRACTS PUBLISHED ABSTRACTS ESHG 2014 | MILAN, ITALY | WWW. ESHG. ORG 490Back to inde x",2014

22823,"Personalized cancer treatment increasingly enters into clinical routine. Due to the fact that each tumor is individual regarding its genomic structure, the screening for these changes on DNA and RNA level in tumor tissue is becoming increasingly crucial for an individually effective therapy. Drugs like EGFR Inhibitors in particular and tyrosine kinase inhibitors in general have proven to benefit greatly from companion diagnostics. Despite this fact, however, expectations of clinical impact on the well being of patients were bigger than what was truly observed. Vast improvements were merely seen in a fraction of treated individuals, making a general assumption less than relevant. Even in patients exhibiting great initial response subsequent relapse was quick to follow. Hence a broader approach of analyzing compre hensive biomarker panels by various techniques should be taken into consi deration to account also for heterogeneity and predict maybe the next phase of tumor expansion. After a short overview of high throughput techniques like next generation sequencing and its combination with routine methods like pathological examination, micro dissection and purification of DNA/RNA, mutation analyses via high resolution melting (HRM), gene expression profiling and epigenetic analysis, the combination of these multiple approa ches for personalized cancer therapy are highlighted.

22824,"Our objective was to determine the effects of hypericin on MCF 7 breast cancer cells, as it is known to have an anti tumor effect on the expression and regulation of ADAMTS1, 3, 10 and the P53 gene in breast cancer cells. MFC 7 cells were cultivated and subjected separately to various doses of 1, 5 and 7.5 ÃÂµg/mL hypericin. After 24 h, RNA was isolated and transcribed into cDNA. Expression analysis was performed by real time RT PCR and cell sur vival was determined by XTT assay. While expression of ADAMTS1 in MFC 7 cells decreased to 0.04 fold after exposure to 1 ÃÂµg /mL hypericin, expressi on increased by 5.6 and 36 fold at 5 mg/mL and 7.5ÃÂµg/mL, respectively. Furthermore, ADAMTS3 expression in MCF7 cells were increased 3.9 fold with the use of 5 ÃÂµg /mL of hypericin. These concentrations of hypericin did not lead to significant changes in the expression of ADAMTS10 and the P53 gene. XTT tests have shown that hypericin concentration of 7.5 ÃÂµg /mL lead to significant death of cancer cells. The increase in ADAMTS1 expression may prevent metastasis or facilitate development of an adjuvant factor with tumor suppressive effects.

Breast cancer has still been the most important subject with other cancer types. This cancer is the most common and second leading cause of death among women. It is known that various plant extracts, including ellagic acid, have anti proliferative and pro apoptotic effect on breast cancer cells. However, miRNAs which are associated with tumor initiation for estrogen dependent breast cancer are suppressed by ellagic acid treatment. In this study, it was aimed that ellagic acid could induce apoptosis related mecha nism in breast cancer cells and this induction could be trigged by altered ex pression profiles of miRNAs. Cytotoxic effects of ellagic acid on MCF 7 breast cancer cells and breast cancer stem cells were examined by WST 1 reagent test. Apoptosis and cell cycle analysis were detected by flow cytometry ana lysis. After ellagic acid treatment, miRNA expression profiles of breast can cer stem cells were determined by RT PCR. While ellagic acid had no any cytotoxic effect on MCF 7 breast cancer cells, cytotoxic value of ellagic acid for breast cancer stem cells was detected as 24.8 ÃÂ¼M dose. Ellagic acid did not induce apoptosis in both cell groups and increased living cells. In the cell cycle, S arrest was observed in MCF 7 breast cancer cells as well as breast cancer stem cells. When analyzed in terms of miRNAs profiles, ellagic acid generally suppressed expression of miRNAs and expression profiles were associated to oncogenic effect. It was suggested that ellagic acid may not be chemo preventive agent because of miRNA profiles, have oncogene effect.",2014

A germline single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP; rs61764370), located in the let 7 complementary site 6 (LCS6) within the 3`UTR of the KRAS gene, affects the binding affinity of microRNA let 7 to the KRAS mRNA and thus gene expression. It was published that KRAS LCS6 SNP is associated with the higher risk of NSCLC development, especially in moderate smokers. Material and methods: DNA was isolated from biopsy and cytology specimens with verified histological diagnosis. Mutation detec tion was done by real time PCR. EGFR patients with no detected mutation were tested for ALK and ROS1 gene rearrangements using the FISH method. SNP (rs61764370) analysis was performed using PCR and RFLP .

ItÃ¢ÂÂs also known that nicotine is metabolized mostly by CYP2A6 and transformed into a cotinine which has an extremely long half life in comparison to nicotine (about 20 hours versus 2 hours). In the present study we have shown dose dependent up/down regulation of P gp expression in Caco 2 cells by nicotine and cotinine exposure. Cells were treated with three different concentrations of nicotine (5ng/ml, 15ng/ml, 50ng/ml) and cotinine (50ng/ml, 250ng/ml, 750ng/ml) for 96 hours. P gp expression was estimated by real time RT PCR. We recognized that P gp expression was increasing in a nonlinear manner. It was shown that the intermediate concentrations of nicotine and cotinine had a lower effect on P gp mRNA level compared to other concentrations including the lowest one which matched passive smokerÃ¢ÂÂs plasma concentrations. Low concen trations lead to 1,5 fold increase of P gp expression in comparison with un treated cells. It was also shown that cotinine has a role in regulation of P gp mRNA level in the case of prolonged smoking abuse.",2014

Several studies have suggested that genetic factors influence the development of factor VIII inhibitors such as mutations in the factor 8 gene. The aim of the present stu dy was to analyze the relationship between inhibitor development and F8 gene mutations in a sample of hemophiliac patients from West Algeria. To study the genetic predisposition for inhibitor development, we geno typed 24 hemophiliac patients with and without inhibitors. Inhibitor detec tion for all patients was performed using the Bethesda assay once every 3 months. A conventional FisherÃ¢ÂÂs exact test was used for statistical analysis; p value <0.05 indicate statistical significance. A total of seven patients had developed inhibitors. Six patients with inhibi tors were classified as low responder; whereas, one patient was categori zed as high responder. In the present study, we showed that there was any association of the F8 gene mutations and the inhibitor development in our study group.

22841,"Breast cancer (BC) represents a heterogeneous disease in which many dif ferent genetic, epigenetic and environmental factors are involved. The aim of our study was to investigate the association of DNA methylation of tumor suppressor genes and histopathological profiles of BCs. The methylation status of 24 tumor suppressor genes was determined in 124 BCs using MS MLPA001 kit. Methylation of more than 15% was regarded indicative for gene hypermethylation. SPSS statistics was used for statistical analysis. A to tal of 103 BCs (87.5%) showed a methylation of at least one tumor suppres sor gene. Seventeen of the 24 analyzed genes showed methylation. The most frequently methylated genes were RASSF1 (66.1%), APC2 (41.9%), CDH13 (35.5%), GSTP1 (25%), DAPK1 (15.3%), and CASP8 (8.1%). Triple negative BCs showed positive association with ESR1 (p,0.006), BRCA1 (p,0.006) and TIMP3 methylation (p,5x10 5) and negative association with RASSF1 (p,0.003) and GSTP1 methylation (p,0.02). Similar associations showed the BCs with BRCA1ness profiles, determined by MLPA analysis. Estrogen (ER) and progesterone (PR) positive BCs were positively associated with RASSF1 (p,0.001 and p,0.003, respectively) and DAPK1 methylation (p,0.018 and p,0.027, respectively). ESR1, CDH13, BRCA1 and TIMP3 were less frequent ly methylated in ER+ tumors. RARB1 and CD44 showed positive association with tumor size (p,0.008 and p,0.006, respectively).

The presence of can cer specific DNA methylation biomarkers in the body fluid of CRC patients will provide a simple, non invasive screening test for colorectal cancer. This study was designed to evaluate methylated SPG20, ALX4, ITGA4 genes as a novel epi panel for screening and detection of CRC. In the first step 90 blood samples were collected from diagnosed cases as colorectal cancer and 40 samples were collected from healthy volunteers as control from Baqiatalah University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran. DNA from plasma samples was extracted by using Qiagene DNA purification protocol following Bisulfite mo dified DNA was amplified by using specific primers for Methylation Specific PCR(MSP).Finally the MSP evaluation was performed on the patients and control groups. The results up to now showed that ITGA4, SPG20, ALX4 were hypermethylated in between 30 to 50% of CRC and polyp patients whereas normal samples were rarely methylated.

22845,"Hadj Lakhdar University, Batna, Algeria. Epigenetics is a fast growing branch of biology. It consists in the study of reversible and transmissible modifications of gene expression without changing DNA sequences. Epigenetic modifications are contributing to the regulation of many physiologic phenomena such us embryonic develop ment, X chromosome inactivation in female and parental imprinting. These modifications are regulated by several mechanisms, the most frequent are: DNA methylation, histones post translational modifications and non coding RNAs. They are influenced by genetic, environmental as well as stochastic factors. It has been shown that physiologic aging depends not only on genetic fac tors but also on Ã¢ÂÂepigenomeÃ¢ÂÂ modifications, and several age related diseases such as cardio vascular diseases, type II diabetes, Alzheimer, auto immune diseases and cancer have been associated to epigenetic changes. Cancer is, so far, the most studied disease in this context, making Ã¢ÂÂepigeneticsÃ¢ÂÂ a plau sible explanation to the increasing rate of cancer in old. Cancer epigenetic modifications lead to expression alteration of genes regulating neoplastic phenotypes such us cell proliferation and metastasis.

It is known that LIG3 and XPA genes may serve as biomarkers for sensitive methods of dosimetry. The purpose of this study is to determine the impact of the IR on gene expression in uranium industry workers of Stepnogorsk city, Kazakhstan. Peripheral blood samples (n,20, n,19) were collected from workers who were exposed to different radiation doses (50mSv, 20mSv). To examine gene expression profiles of radiation exposed workers quantitative real time PCR were used. We used B actin gene as an endogenous control for our study. The expression of LIG3, XPA genes were analyzed and compared between two groups. Gene expression analysis showed statistically significant difference in ex pression of DNA repair genes (LIG3, XPA) between two groups exposed to different doses of radiation. The greater the delivered dose of IR, the greater the expression level of DNA repair genes. Altered expression profiles in this study can be used as biomarkers of do simetry for uranium industry workers. This strategy on risk assessment should be considered in the construction of industrial safety and health of workers occasionally exposed to IR.",2014

22849,"Runs of homozygosity (ROH) are epigenetic changes encompassing relative ly large genomic loci and presenting as stretches of consecutive homozy gous genotypes scattered through the genome. Usually, ROH exceeding 5 10 Mb in length are only considered to have an effect on phenotype. On the other hand, heterozygosity losses of a single imprinted gene can produce an epigenetic change leading to imprinting disorders. Therefore, such epigene tic changes have not necessarily to encompass large genomic loci. Studying ROHs in 115 children with intellectual disability and congenital malformati ons by Affymetrix 2.7M SNP/array, we have found that 1 Mb long ROHs are associated with imprinting disorders. In a case of atypical Angelman syndro me a ROH at 15q11.2 (size 1.16Mb) was detected. Furthermore, two cases of atypical Beckwith Wiedemann associated with ROHS at 11ÃÂ15.5ÃÂ15.4 (size: 1.36Mb and 1.15Mb) were identified. In addition, a long ROH at 7p14.2p12.1 (14.95Mb) affecting GRB10 (an imprinted candidate gene for Silver Russell syndrome) was detected in a child with severe growth retardation, micro cephaly and intellectual disability. Three children (2.6%) demonstrated overall ROH burden typical for offspring of a consanguineous relationship. Retrospectively, consanguinity was confirmed by genealogical analysis. Thus, our observations show that 3.5% of intellectual disability cases can be attributed to ROH. Moreover, ROHs can be as short as 1Mb, which are usually overlooked, when SNP/array assays or other methods for epigene tic analysis are applied. We conclude that these epigenetic mutations are a relatively common mechanism for imprinting disorders. Supported by the Russian Federation President Grant (MD 4401.2013.7).",2014

Biological therapies have been pro posed on the basis of the recognition key oncogenic mutations and these treatments could be effective in stabilizing progressive disease. Epigenetic abnormalities are present in almost all cancers and together with genetic variations led to tumor progression. Epigenetic modification is mostly occur in genes, which play role in the control of cell proliferation and invasion such as RASSF1A, PTEN, DAPK, RAP1GAP , and specific genes of thyroid are mostly epigenetically silenced in thyroid cancer. Rap1, a member of RAS family of small GTPase has been implicated in regulation of mitogenic and oncoge nic pathways in thyroid, and its CpG island methylation is reported in some kind of tumors. In addition, miRNAs play important role in cell differentia tion, proliferation and survival. They considered as the regulators of gene expression at posttranscriptional level. Deregulation of miRNAs expressi on is suspected to be an important regulator of tumor development and progressive.

22851,"It is believed that epigenetics can partly explain the development of neuro logical conditions. As epigenetic changes often happen in utero, maternal behavior may affect brain development. This raises questions regarding the responsibility of the pregnant woman. To which extent is she responsible for the neurological status of the future child? Should she, for example, avoid all stress, if this is shown to lead to molecular changes increasing the chance of the child to develop ADHD later in life? Should she ensure that she takes op timum nutrition for development of synaptic plasticity of her fetus? With of this talk I demonstrate first that epigenetics complicates the question of the responsibility of the pregnant woman. To which extent does the increasing knowledge about epigenetics influences in utero further complicate this re sponsibility, if even behavior of years before the conception may influence a fetus?

22859,"Background and Purpose: We studied the ÃÂ± globin gene genotypes, hema tologic values, and transfusion dependency of patients with hemoglobin H (HbH) disease in Khuzestan Province, Southwest of Iran. Methods: We detected alpha globin gene mutation by Using gap polymerase chain reaction (gap PCR) and direct DNA sequencing. Results: We identified 44 patients with hemoglobin H disease. Of these pati ents, 15 (34%) had deletional form of HbH disease, 29 (66%) had different form of nondeletional HbH disease. The most frequently observed HbH ge notypes were Med/ ÃÂ±3.7 in 14 patients (31.8%), ÃÂ±poly A6ÃÂ±/ ÃÂ±poly A6ÃÂ± in nine patients (20.5%),and ÃÂ±poly A4ÃÂ±/ ÃÂ±poly A4ÃÂ± in five patients (11.3%). Some persons with HbH disease required blood transfusion, whereas some others with the same alpha globin genotype were not transfusion depen dent. Conclusions: Our data show diversity in the genotype and clinical presenta tion of deletional and nondeletional HbH disease. This discrepancy between similar genotypes with different phenotypes may be due to other modifying factors. Therefore, we cannot describe a general conclusion regarding the need for blood transfusion in the patients with HbH disease",2014
22860,"Background: In Poland, the overwhelming majority of individuals with al pha 1 antitrypsin (AAT) deficiency still remains undiagnosed. We estimated the AAT gene frequency and prevalence in a large cohort of Polish chronic lung or liver disease patients eligible for AAT testing. Methods: Blood samples were collected prospectively from 419 respirato ry patients (COPD, emphysema, bronchiectasis, asthma) and 281 patients referred for liver transplantation due to cirrhotic and non cirrhotic chronic disease. AAT serum concentration was measured by nephelometry and PI phenotype identified by isoelectrofocusing. The PI*S and PI*Z alleles were confirmed by real time PCR; rare phenotypes were identified by DNA se quencing. Results: 53 (12.6%) lung disease patients and 18 (6.4%) liver disease pati ents demonstrated AAT deficiency phenotypes. Calculated frequencies ex pressed per 1000 were for PI*Z 46.6 (95% CI: 32.3 60.8), PI*S 20,3 (95% CI: 10.8 29.8) in respiratory patients and PI*Z 19.6 (95% CI: 8.1 31), PI*S 10.7 (95% CI: 2.2 19.2) in liver disease patients. The AAT gene prevalence calculated by Hardy Weinberg equilibrium were: 1/1.16 for MM, 1/26 for MS, 1/2429 for SS, 1/11 for MZ, 1/530 for SZ and 1/462 for ZZ in respira tory patients and 1/1.07 for MM, 1/48 for MS, 1/8773 for SS, 1/26 for MZ, 1/2393 for SZ and 1/2610 for ZZ in liver disease patients. Conclusion: Our results show relatively high frequency of AAT deficiency among Polish patients with chronic obstructive respiratory disorders.

The Cardiac complications and bone deformities are very well documented as outcome of regular transfusion in thalassemics. To evaluate the genetic predisposition for these two important clinical com plications, RANK and MMP9 gene prevalence in transfusion dependent ca ses have been studied. Receptor activator of nuclear factor (RANK) is one of the proteins in regulation of osteoclastogenesis via RANK/RANKL/OPG pathway. In a recent GWAS study RANK was found to be associated with osteoporotic fractures and variations could alter the expression so the two polymorsphisms were studied in beta thalassemia patients. Seventy five patients of thalassemia major were selected and the genotyping of RANK (G > A) polymorphism was performed in thalassemia major patients. High prevalence of G allele [86%] was observed compared to 13% prevalence of A allele. Second RANK (insdel C) polymorphism showed 88.6% of insertion cases while remaining were deletions.

22865,"Introduction: Liver cirrhosis is one of the major gastrointestinal diseases. Cirrhosis is commonly caused by alcohol use, viral hepatitis B and C and many other possible causes. The search for epidemiological, biological or genetic factors that could help to select patients at higher risk of developing cirrhosis is necessary. Among these factors, the influence of excessive liver iron overload and HFE gene mutations have been debated over the past few years and up to now there is limited data on association between HFE gene mutations and cirrhosis. The aim of this study: To determine the association between HFE gene C282Y and H63D mutations and liver cirrhosis. Methods: A cohort of cirrhosis patients consisted of 209 participants. The diagnosis of cirrhosis was confirmed by clinical features, liver biopsy and radiological imaging tests. Control samples were randomly obtained from 1005 blood donors. HFE gene mutations were detected using PCR RFLP method. Statistical analysis were performed using statistical software for genetic association studies PLINK v2.050.Results: C282Y allele was associated with liver cirrhosis (5,02%, OR 2.074, p,0.00510) when compared with controls (2,49%). C282Y/wt genotype was linked with cirrhosis comparing with wt/wt genotype (OR 2.002, p,0.01239). A similar situation was observed in dominant model for C282Y mutation (wt/wt vs. C282Y/wt + C282Y/C282Y) which showed increased risk of liver cirrhosis (OR 2.065, p,0.00766).

22866,"Metabolic syndrome may occur in 40% of postmenopausal women and is largely determined by overweight and obesity. Obesity in menopause wo men occurs as a result of genetic background, hormonal changes and ac quired changes in eating behavior and physical activity. Evidence showed that the endogenous cannabinoid system (ECS) plays a role in obesity and related metabolic disorders. To investigate the association between CNR1 and CNR2 gene polymorphisms and metabolic risk factors in the Chinese postmenopausal women, five hundred and fifteen post menopausal women were recruited. Anthropometric measures (body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC)), blood pressures, and metabolic parameters were determined. Four SNPs from CNR1 gene and 1 SNP from CNR2 gene were selected for genotyping on these post menopausal women. We found that post menopausal women carrying TT+TC genotype of CNR1 rs2023239 had increased risk of metabolic syndrome (p,0.047). We also found two SNPs were significantly associated with pre hypertension or hypertension (OR, 1.72, 95% C. I.: 1.12 2.63 for rs806381 and OR, 1.77, 95% C. I.: 1.00 3.11 for rs1049353, respectively). We further observed that CNR2 rs2229579 was significantly associated with hyper triglycerides in our post menopausal women (OR, 1.85, 95% C. I.: 1.06 3.23). Haplotype analysis also revealed that those women carry the CGTA haplotype of CNR1 gene were less likely to develop pre hypertension or hypertension (aOR, 0.67, 95% C. I.: 0.47 0.96).

It has been sugge sted that sporadic CRC is most likely caused by lowpenetrance genes, in cluding those involved in DNA repair mechanisms. Furthermore, the accu mulation of DNA damage may contribute to colorectal carcinogenesis. Many epidemiological studies have explored the association between ERCC1 As n118Asn (C/T , rs #3177700) polymorphism and colorectal cancer risk in various populations, its role in colorectal carcinogenesis in Algerian popu lation has not been established. Therefore, we conducted this case control study in a West Algerian population to assess the potential role of this gene tic polymorphism on the risk of colorectal cancer. Peripheral blood samples of 90 sporadic CRC patients and 100 normal controls were collected, DNA extracted genotyped using pyrosequencing technique. The distribution of genotypes of ERCC1 Asn118Asn genotype and allele frequencies among CRC cases was not significantly different from those among controls (P>0,05).The variant genotype combinations did not show any significant association with CRC susceptibility risk suggesting that the ERCC1 codon 118 polymor phism does not convey moderate increase in susceptibility to CRC in West Algerian population. This is the first study on ERCC1 gene polymorphism in our population suggesting that the Asn118Asn polymorphism may not be associated with the colorectal cancer risk in West Algerian population. Further research with a larger sample size is needed to reveal more infor mation about this polymorphism and the appearance of colorectal cancer in our population.

Background: Cystic fibrosis occurrence in Arab populations is not common and still remains unidentified. Furthermore, the lack of disease awareness and diagnosis facilities mislead the identification of Cystic Fibrosis (CF) during many decades. The knowledge about cystic fibrosis (CF) in Egypt is very limited, and a few reports have draw attention to the existence of CF or CFTR related disorders in Egyptian population as well as in Lebanese po pulation. Therefore a comprehensive genetic analysis of the CFTR gene was realized in the Egyptian and Lebanese patients. Methods: DNA samples of 56 Egyptian and 17 Lebanese patients were screened for the CFTR gene mutations. The 27 exons and their flanking re gions of the CFTR gene were amplified by PCR using the published primer pairs and were studied by automated direct DNA sequencing to identify disease causing mutations. Results: CFTR screening revealed the identification of seven mutations: in cluding two novel (c.3718 24G>A; c.2782G>C) and five previously reported mutations (c.1418delG, c.2997 3000delAATT , c.902 A>G, c.2620 15C>G, c.3877G>A). Furthermore, six polymorphisms were found: c.1408A>G, c.3870A>G, c.2562T>G, c.1584G>A, c.4389G>A, c.869+11C>T . These mutati ons and polymorphisms were not previously detected in the Egyptian popu lation except for the c.1408A>G polymorphism. Whereas Lebanese patients have a complex allele c.[869+11C>T;3909C>G] not previously described, no other novel mutations were identified. Conclusion: Identification of CFTR mutations will become increasingly im portant in undocumented populations.

Introduction: Cystic Fibrosis (CF) [MIM # 219700] is the most common au tosomal recessive genetic disease, in Caucasian populations [1].In Algeria, no information is available about the incidence of CF. In the Ma ghreb, there are few data about the molecular basis of CF, probably due to an under diagnosis. This study evaluated the effectiveness of the ELUCIGENE CF30 Kit in a samp le of Algerian CF patients. Patients and methods: Subjects: Twenty four (24) unrelated CF patients were recruited from the Pneumology and Allergology Department of the spe cialized Hospital Center in Canastel Oran (Algeria).CF diagnosis was based on a clinical findings and repeated positive sweat chloride tests ( >60 mmol/l).DNA extraction and genotyping 10 ml of whole blood was collected from all participants in EDTA tubes. Genomic DNA was extracted using standard Salting Out procedure [2]. Mutations were explored by the ELUCIGENE CF 30 Kit (Tepnel Diagnostics, Oxon, United Kingdom) which is base d on a PCR/ARMS technique. In screening the twenty four CF patients (48 chromosomes) for 30 mutations available in ELUCIGENE CF30 kit, only five mutations were found: c.1521_1523delCTT (F508del). c.579+1G>T (711+1G>T). c.1624G>T (G542X). c.3909C>G (N1303K). c.1652G>A (G551D).All the mutations found were validated.Ã¢ÂÂ The Elucigene CF30 detected 5 mutations in our sample, which is about 16.66%.Ã¢ÂÂ The detection rate seems low compared to European populations.

22870,"The aim of this work was to evaluate the notification of cystic fibrosis (CF) as primary cause of death in Brazil, from 1981 to 2010, and to compare with developed countries. The Brazilian data was obtained from SIM Data/SUS and the American from the CDC WONDER. The Brazilian median age at death (MAD) was 3.9 years in 1981 and 12.4 years in 2010 for typical severe CF. In 1994, the Brazilian MAD was much lower (7.2y) than that (21y) of seven developed countries reported by Forgarty et al, 2000. We found no increase in MAD in Brazil from 1981 to 1985; from 1986 to 2010 it showed a three fold increase. From 1981 to 1990, there were few deaths over 25 years of age in Brazil, mostly concentrated in younger age groups. During the sample period there was an increase in deaths in higher age groups in Brazil, which may reflect better patient survival rates due to increased knowledge of the disease, with repercussions for its diagnosis and treatment. We also obser ved an increase in the reported cases of CF deaths per 100.000 inhabitants in Brazil over the years, possibly due to the better knowledge of the disease and consequently more accurate death notification, since this increase is not typical of a genetic disease. For the USA we observed a decrease in notified CF deaths, despite the population increase which may be a reflection of a smaller number of people born with CF, due to appropriate genetic counse ling and prenatal diagnosis.",2014

22878,"Aimes: Different alleles within the same gene can cause a similar variant phe notype. Previously published studies showed the allelic heterogeneity of GJB2 gene as main genetic cause of isolated congenital hearing loss phenotype. The proportional distribution of the different mutations within GJB2 gene varies in different ethnic groups. The aim of the present study was to provide a com plete and updated spectrum of mutations in GJB2 and GJB6 gene and to iden tify the most prevalent mutations in Romanian population. Material and Methods: To overcome our aims, we used clinical data from 80 unrelated persons with congenital hearing loss and performed ARMS PCR and DNA sequencing techniques for detection of known mutations and iden tification of mutations within GJB2 gene. Analysis of del(GJB6 D13S1830) and del(GJB6 D13S1854) was performed by multiplex PCR. Results: Most prevalent mutation was c.35delG (40.0%) in both homozygotic and heterozygotic forms. The second mutant allele was W24X (8.75%) also founded in homo or heterozygotic forms, followed by c. 23+1G>A originally named IVS1+1G>A and R127W mutations with lower frequencies. Conclusions: The study reveals c.35delG mutation as most prevalent one, ab sence of GJB6 gene deletions, genetic background of congenital hearing loss in local population and supports improvement of genetic counselling services.",2014

Their activity may influ ence drug response as well as susceptibility to diseases. GSTA1 and GSTP1 genes coding for these enzymes, are important objects of many studies due to their genetic variability which may affect enzymes activity. The aim of our study was to determine the alleles GSTA1*A/*B , GSTP1*A, *B, *C distributi on in the Polish population. We performed our analyses on the DNA of 160 subjects from the Polish population. In the GSTP1 gene we have genotyped two polymorphisms (I105V and A114V) with pyrosequencing method and the GSTA1 gene was screened for the changes in the promoter region using sequencing. The detected variants were subjected to the haplotype analy sis. We found alleles GSTP1*A (c.313A, c.341C), *B (c.313G, c.341C) and *C (c.313G, c.341T) with 65.3%, 23.8% and 10.9% frequency, respectively. As a result of GSTA1 gene promoter sequencing we detected 8 SNPs located in sites: G 52A, C 69T , C 115T , A 513G, T 567G, G 631T , A 1066T , G 1142C, G 1245A. The allele GSTA1*B, associated with the decreased enzyme activity was observed in our study with frequency of 43.1%. Finally, 4 haplotypes have been determined in 160 Polish individuals. Our study demonstrated that the distribution of the alleles GSTA1*A/*B and GSTP1*A, *B, *C in the Po lish population corresponds to data for Caucasians.

Since power and endurance are located at the opposite extremes of a muscle performance continuum, a genome wide association study (GWAS) of elite Russian power oriented athletes (sprinters and strength athletes) and endurance oriented athletes as controls was performed to identify common genetic variants associated with elite power athlete status. 102 sprinters, 86 strength athletes and 178 endurance oriented athletes were genotyped using the IlluminaÃÂ® Huma nOmni1 Quad BeadChips. When comparing sprinters and endurance orien ted athletes, the most significant association (P,6.2 Ã¢ÂÂ10 7) was shown for the rs939787 polymorphism. Interestingly, this association was replicated (P,2.9Ã¢ÂÂ10 6) by comparing strength athletes and endurance oriented ath letes (P,3 Ã¢ÂÂ10 8 when sprinters and strength athletes were combined). The rs939787 is located in the DMD (dystrophin) gene which plays an important role in muscle contraction and strength, linking the intracellular cytoskele ton to the extracellular matrix.

22884,"Leptin, an adipocyte derived protein, plays a key role in regulating ener gy intake and consumption. Increased circulating leptin levels, commonly found in obesity, indicate a failure to signal satiety and halt the progression of obesity. Aim of this study was to investigate the association of single nu cleotide polymorphisms (SNP) and haplotypes of the leptin gene promotor region with body mass index (BMI) in Roma (Gypsy), a population known to be vulnerable to developing obesity presumably due to both their life style and genetic background. We sequenced 1500 bp region of leptin gene promotor in the sample of 377 Roma individuals from Croatia and identified 9 polymorphic sites. Haplo view software was used to assess linkage disequilibrium (LD) among poly morphic loci as well as the Unphased version 3.0.13 software for haplotype association analysis. All nine SNPs were grouped into single LD block due to their proximity. None of the single markers (rs1349419, rs146378188, rs13245201, rs185230264, rs791614, rs12535708, rs10487506, rs11770725 and rs12535747) sho wed individual statistically significant association with BMI.

An emplacement in the crossroads of two continents, Europe and Asia, had a great influence on creation of this diversity. The aim of our study was to analyze few lines that belong to the East Eurasian component of the genetic pool in the region. We focused on the lineages of haplogroup A namely A4b and A10.Haplogroup A4b has previously been found in the study of Derenko et al., 2008 in the Evenk and Buryat populations from Siberia. In our research, we conducted a full genome sequencing of mtDNA samples with this haplogroup in Udmurt and Besermyan populations and found that mutations in the co ding region do not correspond to those in the samples studied by Derenko et al., 2008. It is likely that these two lines are the two sub branches of one subclade A4b. Although our populations showed similarity in difference with the Siberian A4b subclades on the other hand the presence of A4b in our po pulations itself shows some old connections with Siberian populations. We also analyzed a full sequence of all known published examples of haplo group A10 and compared with our results. We found that some new mutati ons that were not previously detected in Dolgan, Nganasan, Nogay and Tadjik populations. It is interesting that Tajik, Tatars from Kazan and Chuvash samples are likely belong to the one subgroup of this haplogroup, indicating the recent common ancestry of these populations.",2014

Previous studies have produced conflicting results regarding the association between IFIH1 gene polymorphisms and MS. Here we examined the effects of 13 single nu cleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the RIG I , IFIH1 and LGP2 genes on MS in the German population. The study comprised 716 patients with MS and 706 healthy control individuals. Genotyping was performed using RFLP , TaqMan genotyping assays and high resolution melting (HRM) analysis. There were no significant differences (p>0.05) between MS patients and healthy indi viduals for any of the investigated SNPs as well as haplotypes derived from these SNPs. Further, no differences were observed between healthy indivi duals and MS subgroups stratified according to disease characteristics. Our results suggest that variation in the RIG I, IFIH1 and LGP2 genes does not exert a major influence on MS risk.",2014
22889,"BACKGROUND: Until recently, myxovirus resistance protein 2 (MX2), a type I interferon induced GTP binding protein, was thought to be devoid of anti viral activity. Latest studies indicate MX2 to be involved in blocking of HIV 1 entry. We aimed to determine, whether C/T polymorphism of MX2 gene (rs45430) is associated with acquisition of HIV and co infections (HCV, HBV, GBVC) in IDUs. METHODS: Study included 345 IDUs and control group comprised of 301 blood donors (all HIV, HCV, and HBV negative). C/T polymorphism of MX2 gene was determined using TaqMan allelic discrimination assay. RESULTS: Of IDUs, 50% were HIV+, 88% HCV+, 67% HBV+, and 33% GBVC+. In total 296 donors and 342 IDUs were successfully genotyped. C/T poly morphism was in Hardy Weinberg equilibrium and allelic frequencies were similar in both groups (0.65 for T allele in IDUs, 0.6 for T allele in donors). No associations between C/T polymorphism and acquisition of HIV, HBV, and HCV were found. However, the prevalence of persons possessing at least one C allele was higher among GBVC compared to GBVC+ (63% vs 51%, p,0.047). Persons with at least one C allele had decreased odds of being GBVC+ (OR,0.62, 95%CI,0.39 0.98), but after adjusting for co variables as sociated with GBVC status (age, HIV positivity) it did not remain significant (OR,0.66, 95%CI,0.41 1.06), which might refer to underpowered groups. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to investigate associations between MX2 (rs45430) polymorphism and acquisition of HIV and co infections in high risk population. Whether this polymorphism plays a role in GBVC ac quisition needs further evaluation.",2014

Methods: Concerning MI, the polymorphisms were characterized in a case control study (69 cases vs 67 age matched controls) based on the male population originating from Oran, Algeria. The associations with blood pressure were assessed in an enlar ged control group including 115 male subjects. Genetic characterization of two polymorphisms was performed by PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction) followed by enzymatic digestion. Results: We neither showed associations of the rs5963409 and rs1800321 polymorphisms with variations in blood pressure values. However, we observed a significant interaction between the rs5963409 polymorphism and Body Mass Index (BMI) on the risk of the occurrence of MI.

Whether and how the NLRP3 polymorphism is associated with susceptibility to HIV in IDUs is unknown. METHODS: We studied 172 HIV+ IDUs and 20 highly exposed HIV IDUs (HESNs). 301 blood donors negative for HIV, HCV and HBV were used as controls. The NLRP3 polymorphism rs10754558 (C/G) was determined using TaqMan allelic discrimination assay. RESULTS: Altogether 191 IDUs were genotyped successfully. Of HIV+ 98.3% were HCV+ and 82.0% HBV+. Of HESNs 80.0% were HCV+ and 45.0% HBV+. NLRP3 C was the major allele in all groups and did not differ between groups (allelic frequencies 0.68 in HESNs, 0.63 in HIV+ and 0.60 in donors). The polymorphism was in Hardy Weinberg equilibrium in all groups. The most common NLRP3 genotype was CG (52.9% in HESNs, 55% in HIV+ and 44.2% in donors). The distribution of NLRP3 polymorphisms did not differ between HESNs and HIV+ IDUs. However, HESNs possessed more NLRP3 CG genotype than donors (70.0% vs 44.2%; p,0.0373). No differences were found in CG heterozygotes in HIV+ (50.3%) compared to other groups. CONCLUSIONS: Similar to mother to child transmission NLRP3 CG genotype might be associated with increased risk of HIV infection in Caucasian IDUs.",2014

22893,"Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic autoimmune disease of the central ner vous system, characterized by inflammation, demyelination and axonal in jury, probably caused by environmental factors in genetically susceptible individuals. Neuregulin 1 (NRG1) is involved in neuronal specification and migration, gliogenesis, neuron glial signalling. Viehover et al. (2001) found that the expression of Neuregulin is dramatically reduced in MS lesions and hypo thesized that the absence of this protein contribute to the paucity of remye lination in the disease. For these reasons, the NRG1 gene could represent a good candidate for a research on patients with immuno related and demye linating disordes. We focused our attention on it, aiming at evaluating its role in Southern Italy by means of a case control study. We examined 226 patients with MS and 200 healthy controls. Genotyping was performed by amplification and subsequent digestion with the restric tion enzyme CviQI. We found significant differences of allele and genotype distributions (p,0.011 and p,0.05, respectively) between cases and controls. To our knowledge, this is the first study performed on NRG1 in patients with MS. On the basis of the preliminary data obtained in our population, we could hypothesize an involvement of the gene in the susceptibility to the disease. In particular, the presence of the T allele, under represented in the patients, seems to be a protective factor against MS. However, due to the small number of participants, the confirmation of the role of NRG1 requires further studies extended to a larger sample of subjects and also to other populations.",2014

We have also found the association of rs494379*A/G genotype with PUD in Tatars (ÃÂ ,0,001;OR,2,58). Genotype rs17576*A/G is a marker of the increased risk of PUD development in males (ÃÂ ,0,005;OR,1,79), whe reas rs3918242*T/T and rs17576*A/A were protective (ÃÂ ,0.037;OR,0.10; ÃÂ ,0.01;OR,0.61, respectively). The association analysis of the rs228505 and rs2276109 with PUD has not revealed significant differences between patients and healthy donors (ÃÂ>0,05). Thus, we have determined statistical ly significant association between MMPs genes polymorphisms and peptic ulcer in Volga Ural region of Russia.",2014
22898,"PMS2 gene product is involved in DNA mismatch repair process. Besides the gene, there are several pseudogenes in the human genome, showing high sequence homology. To describe and distinguish sequence polymorphism in highly homologous loci which could be co amplified in PCR assays, we have sequenced Ã¢ÂÂshortÃ¢ÂÂ 243 bp fragment containing co amplifying regions chr7:6026862 6027104 (part of PMS2 exon 11) and chr7:6776854+6777096 (part of PMS2CL pseudogene) in 50 DNA samples. In 14 DNA samples, addi tional Ã¢ÂÂlongÃ¢ÂÂ fragment encompassing region chr7:6026862 6027488 (part of intron 10 and exon 11 PMS2 ) has been sequenced. The same heterozygous positions in both fragments, together with peak height differences in hete rozygous positions within the short fragment allowed us to determine their location (gene/pseudogene) and to calculate MAF estimates. Altogether 6 variable positions were identified and most of them had been registered as SNPs in PMS2 in public databases (NCBI). Among them were rs111255573 (C/T) in intron 10 (MAF,0,036) and rs15020462 (A/G, Gly460Asp) in exon 11 (MAF,0,080). High frequency was determined for rs1805321(C/T , Pro470Gly, allele T frequency 0.525) in additional 134 samples by restriction analysis. We have found that rs63750685 polymorphism (C/G, MAF,0.120) is actually located in the pseudogene (rs199736163), as well as novel SNP A/G in position chr7:6777067 (MAF,0.090). The previously known SNP rs1805320 (C/T) turned out to be a difference between the gene (C) and the pseudogene (T) sequences.

22899,"The renin angiotensin system (RAS) is supposed to be one of the regulators of skeletal muscle growth and differentiation (Zhang et al. 2003; Johnston et al. 2011). Renin (encoded by REN gene), as a component of the RAS, acti vates the renin angiotensin cascade by catalyzing the conversion of angio tensinogen to angiotensin I (Rupert, 2006). The aim of present study was to investigate the association between the intron 8 83A/G (rs2368564) po lymorphism of the REN gene, athlete status and muscle mass in Russians. Two hundred and sixty eight Russian athletes (90 females and 178 males) from different sporting disciplines were involved in the study. REN genotype and allele frequencies were compared to 151 controls (74 females and 77 males). Genotyping for the REN polymorphism was performed by RT PCR. Muscle mass parameters were assessed by bioelectrical impedance analyzer Tanita MC 980 (Japan) in 125 athletes (44 females and 81 males). We found that the frequency of the REN G allele was significantly higher in power oriented athletes (78 vs 68%; P,0.021) compared to controls and this dif ference was even more pronounced in elite power oriented athletes (89%; P,0.018). Furthermore, the REN G allele was positively correlated with fat free mass, absolute muscle mass, muscle mass of trunk and left/right legs in elite athletes. In conclusion, we have shown that the 83A/G polymorphism of the REN gene is associated with power athlete status and skeletal muscle parameters in Russians.",2014

The aim of this work was to in vestigate the association between a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) located in a possible regulatory region of PGR (rs1942836) and two diffe rent clinical subtypes of preterm birth: spontaneous (PTB I) and premature rupture of membrane (PTB PROM). This SNP has been previously studied in a heterogeneous group of PTBs. Methods. The sample included 412 triads (proband, mother, father) recrui ted at the Nuestra SeÃÂ±ora de la Merced Maternity Hospital in TucumÃÂ¡n, Ar gentina. Of these triads, 200 had probands from PTB I and 212 had probands from PTB PROM. Genotyping was performed using Applied Biosystems Taq man probes and the Fluidigm genotyping platform. Both maternal and fetal genetic effects were analyzed using a log linear method for analysis of case parentÃ¢ÂÂtriad data (Weinberg et al. 1998).Results. We found a significant association between rs1942836 (maternal effect) and PTB I (OR: 2.01; IC 95%: 1.12 3.61; p, 0.01), but not between this SNP and PTB PROM (OR: 1.05; IC 95%: 0.57 1.93; p, 0.85).Conclusions. These results would suggest a specific association between the PGR gene (maternal effect) and PTB I, but not with PTB PROM. These findings may have implications in understanding the pathophysiology of clinical subtypes of preterm birth and the potential therapeutic role of pro gesterone in prevention of PTB I.",2014

The study was conducted on the original protocol ex amined by standard protocol of medical genetic research elaborated in labo ratory of genetic epidemiology, Research Centre for Medical Genetics. About 3500 MHD and syndromes of OMIM could be identified by this protocol. Clinical investigations were performed by pediatricians, clinical geneticists, neurologists, ophthalmologists, orthopedists, audiologist, and dermatolo gists, focused on diagnostic of MHD. The spectrum of MHP detected in the eight Districts comprises 158 nosologycal forms 84 autosomal dominant (AD), 54 autosomal recessive (AR) and 20 X linked. The total prevalence rate of childrenÃ¢ÂÂs population by all types MHD AD, AR, and X linked, sepa rately for urban (1:187 children) and rural (1:89 children) populations was calculated. In rural populations, the prevalence is higher in 2 times higher than in urban. The total prevalence of MHD was 1:103 children. Given that this study can detect only half of hereditary diseases, the total prevalence of hereditary disorders in children more than 1,2%. In this study, we studied the prevalence of hereditary diseases among children Republics Bashkorto tan, Udmurtia, Rostov Region and Chuvashia, in which the burden of heredi tary diseases was 1.4%, 1.2%, 1.3% and 1.1%, respectively.",2014

However, ethnical variability of genetic markers is well known. The purpose was to study association of genetic variation in candidate genes of patients diagnosed with restenosis in the Kazakh popu lation. This case control study included patients with a diagnosis of coronary heart disease (CHD) who developed restenosis. The control group consisted of pa tients with CHD who have not developed restenosis within 6 months after stenting. Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral whole blood samples. SNP genotyping was performed on QuantStudio 12K Flex. Allele frequencies in both case and control groups were in compliance with Hardy Weinberg equilibrium. Odds ratios (OR) and p values have been calculated for all stu died SNPs. Confidence interval (CI) was set at 95% significance level. Sampling data shows that men undergo stenting at an earlier age than wo men. In addition, an increased BMI was found in all patients. The results sho wed that known associations of polymorphisms with the risk of restenosis, shown by J. W. Verschuren in the European population, were not observed in Kazakh population. However, a statistically significant association with the risk of restenosis was found with fibrinogen beta chain gene polymorphism rs1800790 (OR 2.1, P value 0.009) and thrombomodulin (THBD) gene polymorphism rs1042579 (OR 1.7, P value 0.01).It can be inferred that both polymorphisms are likely to be predictors of restenosis, while THBD polymorphism is specific for Asian population.",2014

The aim of this study is cross ethnic group comparisons of frequencies and analysis of associations with T1D 23 HphI INS dimorphism (in promoter region of the gene, rs689) in Bashkir, Buryat, Udmurt, Yakut and Russian ethnic group of the Russian Federation. Case control design was applied for assessment of 528 patients with T1D and 374 healthy sex and ethnos matched individuals. Allele identification was performed with RFLP or Real Time PCR technique. Association of genetic markers with pathology was evaluated according to odds ratio index (OR), association was considered statistically significant when p value<0,05). Al lel A and genotype AA of rs689 are associated with T1D in Russian (OR,2,5 and 2,7 respectively), Bashkir (OR,5 and 6 respectively), Udmurt (OR,2,4 ABSTRACTS PUBLISHED ABSTRACTS ESHG 2014 | MILAN, ITALY | WWW.

In Europe, itÃ¢ÂÂs estimated that one to three per 100 000 individuals suffer from a SCA subtype, but this number could vary among different ethnic and geographic groups. Epidemiological data on SCAs is considered scarce and fragmentised, with only their relative frequency within a population usually being better known. The goal of this study was to systematically compile and update the available information regarding prevalence of SCAs, as well as several indicators, namely number of published reports, expert centres, dia gnostic tests, patientÃ¢ÂÂs organizations, available biobanks, as well as perfor med and ongoing clinical trials. Data were collected considering literature reports from 2000 until 2013, and using several databases, such as Orpha net and EuroGentest.

22906,"Testosterone regulates muscle mass and strength, bone mass, fat distribu tion and the production of red blood cells. Sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) is the key protein responsible for binding and transporting of te stosterone. SHBG regulates its bioavailability and therefore its effects in the body. Polymorphism at the SHBG gene locus (rs12150660 G/T) has been associated with testosterone concentrations. Since individuals with the TT genotype have higher serum testosterone concentrations in comparison with carriers of the G allele (data from GWAS), we hypothesized that the carriage of the T allele may give some advantage for strength and power performance. The aim of the study was to investigate the association bet ween the SHBG G/T polymorphism, athlete status and muscle mass. A total of 363 Russian athletes and 130 controls were genotyped using RT PCR. Muscle mass was measured by body composition analyzer Tanita MC 980. The frequencies of the T allele in power oriented athletes (n,143, 20.3%; P,0.7462), endurance oriented athletes (n,220, 15.0%; P,0.2054) and a whole cohort of athletes (17.1%; P,0.5078) were not significantly different from controls (18.8%). However, the frequency of the T allele in elite power oriented athletes (n,65, 26.2 vs. 12%, P,0.0061) was significantly higher as compared with elite endurance oriented athletes (n,58). Furthermore, correlation analysis showed positive association between the T allele and muscle mass among non elite female athletes (n,8, P,0.0072, r, 0.8729).

22911,"Introduction: Recurrent spontaneous abortion represents a frequent and important medical problem. There are a lot of possible causes, but during last years a great proportion of the women with recurrent spontaneous ab ortion have been shown to harbor thrombophilic mutations. Material and methods: Five thrombophilic mutations, namely Factor V Lei den, Prothrombin G20210A, PAI 1 4G/5G, MTHFR C677T and A1298C have been tested in 627 consecutive women with recurrent spontaneous abortion of unknown etiology (other causes, such as anatomical or endocrine factors, antiphospholipid syndrome, or chromosomial anomalies were excluded by specific investigations).The methods used were PCR based assays (PCR RFLP , ARMS PCR, tetra primer PCR).Results: Fifty eight patients (9.2%) harboured the Factor V Leiden mutati on, while the Prothrombin G20210A was seen in 37 patients (5.9%). Four patients (0.6%) harboured both mutations. At least one 4G allele of the PAI 1 mutation was seen in 482 patients (77%), of which 184 (29.3%) were 4G/4G homozygotes. At least a variant allele of the MTHFR mutations was seen in 546 patients (87%), of which 291 patients (46.4%) were either ho mozygotes for C677T or A1298C mutations, or compound heterozygotes. There were only 13 patients (2.1%) homozygous for the wild type allele in case of all 5 mutations analyzed. Conclusions: A great proportion of women with recurrent spontaneous abortion harbour thrombophilic mutations.

We ana lyzed 40 SNP and 17 STR Y chromosomal markers. Summary statistics were calculated using Arlequin 3.5. Neighbor joining tree was constructed by the program MEGA 5.0. Multidimensional scaling plot was drawn by the softwa re package Statistica v.7.1. Population pairwise FST values were calculated from the Y chromosomal haplogroup frequencies to assess the genetic similarity among studied groups of Kazakh tribes. The most distant ones were the tribe of Sunak and the Small Zhuz (0.393), whereas the shortest distance was found between the tribe of Tore and the Great Zhuz (0,021). These genetic distances are associated with the geographic distances between studied populations. The distribution of Y chromosomal haplogroups is strongly correlated with the tribal clan structure of Kazakhs. Presence of certain haplogroups at high fre quency at particular tribes is in favor to the hypothesis that many tribes go back to one biological founder, confirming the link between Kazakh family tree Shezhire with the genetic composition.",2014

Detailed analysis of about 500 Slavic complete mitogenomes belonging to different haplogroups allowed us to identify a number of lineages that seem spe cific for Central and Eastern Europe (U3b1b, U4a2a1, U5a2a1c, U2e1b1a, U2e1b1, U3a1a, H5a1f, U5a1a1a1, U5a1c1, U2e2a1a, U4a2a, H5a2, U2e2a1d and U5a1b1b). These subhaplogroups consist of similar haplotypes revealed in different ethnic groups of modern Slavs, thereby proving the existence of ethnolinguistic community of Slavs through DNA testing. Evolutionary age of Slavic specific subhaplogroups is calculated to approximately 3.9 ky (from 2.3 to 5.9 ky, according to the mutation rate proposed by Soares et al. (2009) for the entire mtDNA molecule). This indicates that the ancestors of modern Slavs inhabited areas of Central and Eastern Europe from the times of Bronze and Iron Ages, i.e. earlier than it was estimated on the basis of archaeological, historical and linguistic data.

22917,"Background: Inherited hemoglobin disorders are the most common mono genic defects described worldwide. It is well established that Mediterranean and Arab populations are at high risk for thalassemias in general, and for ÃÂ± thalassemia in particular. Prenatal as well as premarital screening pro grams in countries with high prevalence have already been founded. In this study, we aim at assessing the incidence of alpha thalassemia deleterious alleles in the Lebanese population. Methods: DNA was extracted from 200 newborns dried blood cards remaining from routine neonatal screening at the American University of Beirut Medical Center. DNA samples were screened for the 21 most common ÃÂ± globin deletions and point mutations reported worldwide, through multiplex Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) and Reverse Hybridization technique. Results: The carrier rate of thalas semia in our sample population was 8% which is higher than that reported from Jordan (2 4%). This finding is comparable to Mediterranean countries (Israel: 5 9%, Greece: 7%, Adana Turkey: 7.5%) but lower than that repor ted in other Arab countries (UAE: 16.5%; Oman: 38.6%; Saudi Arabia: 50%). Two mutations were detected: the 3,7del single gene deletion (75%) and the non gene deletion 2 IVS1 [ 5nt] (25%). These mutations are common worldwide. Interestingly, the ÃÂ± 4.2 and MED mutations, particularly com mon in Arab and Middle Eastern populations, were absent in our survey Conclusion: This study is the first dedicated to investigate ÃÂ± thalassemia genotype incidence in Lebanon. Data obtained demonstrates a high carrier rate in a relatively, highly consanguineous population. These results may im pact premarital and newborn screening policies in our country.",2014
22918,"dÃ¢ÂÂ Annunzio University, Chieti, Italy, 3Functional Genetics Unit, Center of Excellence on Aging (CeSI), Chieti, Italy. Serotonergic neurotransmission affects a large range of behaviors, from food intake to sensory processing and motor activity, cognition, emotion re gulation, social behavior and most important to our proposal, reproductive activity. A key regulator for serotonergic neurotransmission is the serotonin transporter (5 HTT), which removes serotonin released into the synaptic cleft. The 5 HTT protein is encoded by a single gene, SLC6A4. Transcriptio nal activity of this gene is modulated by several variations, including a repe titive sequence, the SLC6A4 linked polymorphic region (5 HTTLPR). Speci fically, the 5 HTTLPR short allele (s) has reduced transcriptional efficiency compared with the long allele (l), and individuals carrying the s allele tend to have, among other, an exaggerated amygdala response to threatening visual stimuli, biased processing of emotional information, likely resulting from altered functional connectivity within a corticolimbic circuit, impulsi vity and increased anxiety related temperamental traits. We used a new instrument for the measure of sexual behavior: Ã¢ÂÂSex Pro miscuity Infidelity QuestionnaireÃ¢ÂÂ on a cohort of 154 female students re cruited at the University of Chieti, in order to test the possible interactions between s carriers individuals and sexual behavior. Through an Explorative Factor Analysis (EFA) we explored the factor structure of the questionnaire, composed by three factors: Ã¢ÂÂDemographic InformationsÃ¢ÂÂ, Ã¢ÂÂSexual Promiscui tyÃ¢ÂÂ and Ã¢ÂÂSexual InstabilityÃ¢ÂÂ. Furthermore the EFA showed significant s carri ersÃ¢ÂÂ factor loadings on sexually instability behavior factor ( .35).Our findings support the possible association between serotonergic neu rotransmission, mediated by 5 HTTLPR affect, and the sexual behavior in female healthy subjects.",2014

We set out to test whether rare variants and polymorphisms in these genes can predispose to tuberculosis. These genes were studied in two Siberian populations of Russians (304 patients, 265 controls) and Tuvinians (238 patients, 263 controls). First, we carried out the screening for most common mutation variants of the genes (IL12RB1 Gln32Ter, Gln376Ter, Arg213Trp; IFNGR1 Ile87Thr, 4 bp Del NT818, 1 bp Del NT818; IFNGR2 2 bp Del 278AG, Thr168Asn, 663Del27; STAT1 Leu706 Ser, Gln463His, Glu320Gln). All these variants appeared as Ã¢ÂÂwild typeÃ¢ÂÂ. Then we performed the search for rare variants of the studied genes by SangerÃ¢ÂÂs sequencing in 10 individuals suffered from aggressive forms of TB. Direct sequencing did not reveal any mutations causing atypical familial myco bacteriosis; however, 15 previously established single nucleotide polymor phisms were identified (IL12RB1 rs11086087, rs11575934, rs17852635, rs401502, rs12461312, rs17882555, and rs3746190; IL12B rs919766; IFNGR1 rs2234711, rs17181457, rs7749390, rs11754268, and rs11914; IFNGR2 rs17883129; and STAT1 rs2066797). Using Ã¢ÂÂcase controlÃ¢ÂÂ design, we identified an association between the rs2066797 variant of the STAT1 gene and TB in Russians (p,0.02). Association of this polymorphism with TB was detected for the first time.

22920,"Genome wide association studies (GWAS) have revolutionised the field of gene mapping. As the GWAS field matures it is becoming clear that for many complex traits, a proportion of the missing heritability is attributable to common variants of individually small effect. Detecting these small effects individually can be difficult and statistical power would be increased if re levant variants could be grouped together for testing. We propose grouping markers together based on pre specified biological pathways. We have im plemented this pathway based test in the program Pathway VEGAS. The me thod is based on prior calculation of gene based p values using the existing Versatile Gene based Association Study (VEGAS) software. Pathway VEGAS uses the gene based P values to construct a pathway test based on a set of pre specified pathways. The method appropriately takes into account situa tions where neighbouring genes are present in the same pathway results for relevant regions are calculated by accounting for linkage disequilibrium between markers using simulations from the multivariate normal distribu tion. Pathway size is taken into account via a re sampling approach. Impor tantly, since the approach only requires summary data, the method can be easily applied in all GWASs, including meta analysis, singleton based, family based and DNA pooling based designs. We found statistically significant fin dings using pathway VEGAS on a number of traits including endometriosis, height and educational attainment. The approach identifies biologically re levant pathways, offering insights not possible with single marker approa ches.",2014

Here we present CNV analysis for a cohort of 183 consanguineous families with one or more children affected with ASD. We provide new insights into the genetic architecture of ASDs as our cohort is uniquely enriched for recessive loss of function variants. We follow up fin dings and draw comparisons with additional large ASD and control data sets: the Simons Simplex and the Autism Genetic Resource Exchange (AGRE) collections (2,670 affected individuals; 9681 total individuals). Comparing across these cohorts, we demonstrate that ascertainment can lead to selec tion of different underlying genetic mechanisms causing ASDs. These diffe rences are reflected in metrics such as the affected male:female ratio and the relative contribution of de novo CNVs versus inherited homozygous de letions. Specifically, we find that de novo CNVs play a significant role in non consanguineous families with a single affected child (p,0.04), but a lesser role in multiplex families, and they are no more common in ASD cases than controls in multiplex consanguineous families. In contrast, we present the strongest statistical evidence (p,0.013) to date that homozygous deletions, are a major contributor to ASD disease burden in consanguineous families, contributing to as much as 5 10% of cases.",2014
22922,"Genotype imputation is now an essential tool in genetic studies to syste matically infer missing and untyped genotypes. Accordingly, progressive ly larger reference panels are being constructed based on whole genome sequencing in various populations. Developing general guidelines for op timally cost effective imputation designs, however, requires evaluation of performance issues that include the relative utility of population specific compared to general/multi population reference panels; genotyping with various array scaffolds; and effects of different ethnic backgrounds. Here we compared the effectiveness of a Sardinian specific (SardSeq) panel, derived from whole genome sequencing of 2,120 Sardinians, to the 1000 Genomes Project (1000G) reference panels, using combinations of two genome wide and three custom arrays as baseline genotype, in both Sardinians and other Europeans. In Sardinians, the SardSeq panel provided better coverage and genotype imputation accuracy than the 1000G panels, particularly for low frequency and rare variants (mean squared correlation with true genotypes 0.95 vs 0.68, respectively, at variants with MAF >1% and <5%). In particular, when imputing with the SardSeq panel, even gene centered custom arrays interrogating a smaller number of variants (on the order of 200,000, as the Illumina CardioMetaboChip) provided highly informative content across the entire genome. Notably, in Sardinians a combined panel including both the SardSeq and the 1000G sequencing data did not provide substantial im provement. By contrast, we showed that a combined panel could be advan tageous in other Europeans. We expect our results to be useful in planning future studies and in current sequencing efforts that are not part of the 1000 Genomes Project.",2014

Gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA) is the major inhibitory neurotransmit ter in the brain, acting primarily via the GABA receptors. Multiple lines of evidence indicate that dysfunction of GABA B receptors may be involved in the pathogenesis of temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). The aim of this study was to determine whether a single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), +8A>G (rs2304391) at 3Ã¢ÂÂUTR of subunit 2 of the GABA B receptor gene (GABBR2), contributes to TLE. We used a case control approach comparing the fre quency of the above mentioned GABBR2 polymorphism between patients with TLE and controls. We enrolled 303 consecutive patients (167 women; mean SD age: 47.08 18.10), and 271 healthy controls (137 women; mean SD age: 64.20 ÃÂ± 17.06), matched for age, sex and ethnicity. All patients had a diagnosis of non lesional TLE, based on comprehensive clinical, neuropsy chological, electroencephalographic, and brain MR evaluations. All patients and controls were Caucasian and were born in Italy. Patients and controls gave written informed consent prior to participation in the genetic stu dies. Patients and controls were genotyped for detection of the rs2304391 polymorphism using TaqMan Allelic Discrimination assays, on an Applied Biosystems PCR platform. The genotype distributions for both healthy sub jects and epileptic patients were consistent with the Hardy Weinberg equi librium.

Furthermore, combinatorial approaches based on prin cipal components analysis with the generalized multifactor dimensionali ty reduction method to study G x G and G x E interactions uniting nuclear families and unrelated individuals have been proposed. We apply methods of G x G interaction to a sample of 7224 individuals who have been pheno typed for their drinking and alcohol abuse and genotyped on 970 SNPs in 34 GABA system genes including 20 GABA receptor subunit genes. Results from applying both combinatorial approaches, PGMDR and Random Forest approaches based on classification trees, to the alcohol use data will be pre sented. We further discuss and compare the power to detect these interac tions using these two methods and the resulting outcome.

The Island has been isolated and strict immigration and quarantine legislation restrict new founder from migration. In an attempt to understand and identify gene interactions in this unique population we performed a microarray analysis using an Illumina HumanHT 12 v4 array in venous blood samples from 335 related individuals. In order to compare the transcriptome structure from Norfolk Island population, we have taken pre viously published microarray data from the Atlanta CHDWB study. An unsu pervised clustering analysis using k means and principal component analy sis (PCA) were performed using R. PCA showed that, in the Norfolk Island population, approximately 22% of the total variation is explained by its first principal component, against 14% of variation in the CHDWB population. On the other hand, the k means analysis identified 24 clusters in the Norfolk Island population and 18 in the CHDWB population where approximately 31% of the transcripts could not be assigned to any of the clusters due to the lack of correlation. Enrichment analysis and Network visualization was per formed.

Chromosomal microarray analysis (CMA) has emerged as a powerful new tool to identify genomic abnormalities associated with a wide range of deve lopmental disabilities and congenital anomalies. The detection of submicroscopic copy number variants (CNVs), not visible by conventional karyotyping, helped the genetic diagnosis in our paediatric patients who had already received, with normal results, standard karyotype analysis, metabolic screening, single gene sequencing. Since 2008, 212 pa tients, aged 2 months 16 years, were analyzed using SNP array technology and clinically significant submicroscopic imbalances were detected in 70 ca ses (33%). De novo imbalances were identified in 26 children (12 %), while inherited imbalances were recognized in 34 children (16 %). In 10 patients it was not possible to study both parents. In 59 patients (27,8%) a CNV was causative for the phenotype: in these cases, known microdeletion/micro duplications syndromes and chromosomal region with a likely pathogenic correlation were identified. In 11 patients (5%) two or more CNVs were presents (2 CNV, 7 patients; 3 CNV, 4 patients): parentsÃ¢ÂÂ analysys revealed that the rearrangements were inherited and contributed to childÃ¢ÂÂs clinical phenotype. Clinicians who evaluate children with developmental disabili ties and congenital anomalies have the role to attempt to establish a genetic etiology.

Genetic counselling for these new marker chromosomes may be challenging, both for the patients and the parents, particularly when the sSMC is a derivative of a maternally in herited translocation, resulting in partial trisomy of two chromosomes.

Classical cytogenetics revealed an abnor mal sSMC. The fatherÃ¢ÂÂs karyotype was normal but the mother had a t(9;21) balanced translocation. Analysis of Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH whole chromosome painting and centromeric probes, Cytocell) and Multi plex Ligation dependent Probe Amplification (MLPA, MRC Holland) results in the proband allowed us to conclude that she has partial trisomy for chro mosomes 9 (9p21 >pter) and 21(pter >21q21).

The first patient was referred to us with the suspect of thalassemia trait. Only asking a detailed clinical story, a previous surgical intervention (at the age of 15) for cataract was referred. Pedigree analysis showed a brother with cataract. After this, in the brother hyperferritinemia levels were discovered too. The second one was referred, during pregnancy, because of the presence of ca taract and hyperferritinemia. Pedigree analysis showed bilateral cataract and hyperferritinemia in several relatives. The association of hyperferriti nemia in patients with congenital cataract and positive family history led us to consider a diagnosis of Hyperferritinaemia Cataract Syndrome (HHCS). HHCS is an autosomal dominant syndrome characterized by cataract and high ferritin serum levels, not related to iron overload. The syndrome is caused by heterozygous mutations in the iron responsive element (IRE) of the ferritin light chain gene (FTL).

However this lady did not have any counseling before pregnancy because the cardiologist asked her not to be pregnant. It is important to consider how we could share the genetic information with female patients who is not allowed to conceive, but might happen to be pregnant.",2014

22937,"Silver Russell syndrome (SRS) is a congenital imprinting disorder with hypom ethylation of ICR1 on chromosome 11p15.5 or maternal uniparental disomy of chromosome 7 (mUPD7), characterized mainly by severe pre and postnatal growth retardation, relative macrocephaly and a small triangular face. Retrospective and prospective assessment included 77 SRS patients (36 fema ABSTRACTS PUBLISHED ABSTRACTS ESHG 2014 | MILAN, ITALY | WWW. ESHG. ORG 515Back to inde x les and 41 males), at the mean age of 4.75 years (range 0.1 18.5 years), with the molecular confirmation of ICR1 hypomethylation in 63 (82%) and mUPD7 in 14 (18%) subjects. Anthropometric measurements were performed using standard techniques and variables were expressed by number of standard deviations (SDS) in refe rence to the calendar age. Mean number of sessions per patient was 8 (range 1 35). Growth parameters, BMI, head characteristics and developmental ano malies were analyzed and scored. Statistically significant differences were shown with regard to following para meters: mean SDS for weight, height, BMI and lower extremities length were lower in the mUPD7 group of patients but head circumference, length and breadth of head, forehead and bizygomatic breadth were larger compared to ICR1 hypomethylation group. Asymmetry (face/body/limbs) and major con genital anomalies were more frequent in patients with ICR1 hypomethylati on. Interestingly, genital anomalies (underdevelopment of the uterus, gonadal dysgenesia/ambiguous genitalia, cryptorchidism, hypospadias) were scored only in patients with the loss of ICR1 methylation. Systematic and long term follow up of both SRS groups enabled assessment novel correlations of the phenotype depending on epigenetic modulations.

22938,"Floating Harbor syndrome (FHS; OMIM #136140) is a rare genetic condi tion characterized by short stature, delayed bone age and speech develop ment, and typical facial dysmorphism. The face of FHS is the most distinctive aspect for making the right diagnosis; otherwise it can be difficult. The ty pical FHS phenotype consists of triangular facial shape, deep set eyes with long eyelashes and low set, large, often posteriorly rotated ears, nose nar row at the root broadening to the tip, low hanging columella, large nares, short philtrum and wide mouth with thin upper and everted lower lip. Whole exome sequencing revealed heterozygous truncating mutations (nonsense or frameshift) in the SRCAP gene in several affected persons (Hood at al., 2012). The mutations are de novo, some of them are recurrent and all are tightly clustered within the final exon, with the exception of a recently identified stop mutation in the penultimate exon 33 (Kehrer et al., 2013).Here we present two patients with typical FHS facial features, although they slightly differ one from the other. In the first patient a nonsense mutation c.7330C>T (p. Arg2444*) was detected. This is a recurrent mutation descri bed in several other patients. The parents of the patient did not harbour this mutation, thus supporting its de novo origin. A frame shift mutation c.7257_7258delAA (p. Gln2419 fs*23) was detected in the second case. To our knowledge this mutation has not been described yet. Phenotype / geno type correlation is further discussed. Supported by 00064203 and CZ.2.16/3.1.00/24022.",2014
22939,"Epigenetic modifications of DNA might be crucial for understanding the molecular basis of mood disorders. One reason for this is that epigenetic factors are sometimes plastic enough to react the external and internal envi ronments. New scientific studies suggest, that these environmental factors can be not only food or chemicals, but also spiritual: positive emotional sta te, optimism, reaction to stress. The aim of this manuscript is to provide a conceptual background for studies by reviewing key findings from different forms of investigation. In order to provide an understanding the role of ge netic and environmental (spiritual) factors in the causation of mental disor ders here is a simplified account of some of the key features of how genes Ã¢ÂÂworkÃ¢ÂÂ. Results of that review indicate that of particular interest, traumatic events or negative mind content may potentially alter our DNA methylati on pattern and induce abnormal brain gene expression and ultimately de pression, and other mood disorders. In summary, this review demonstra tes that an epigenetic state of a genes responsible for mental health can be established through life experience and thinking manner and is potentially reversible.",2014
22940,"Backround: Pregnant women are referred to genetic counselling when there are increased risk factors to a fetus. Often this is associated with increased stress or lack of information. The aim of the study was to identify the rea sons why women attend genetic counselling, and their actions if a genetic disease would be found in their fetus. Methods: A prospective analysis was based on original genetic question naire given to 277 pregnant women who were attending genetic counselling in LSMU central policlinic. The gathered data was analyzed using statistic program SPSS 17. The resultsÃ¢ÂÂ significance were assessed by Chi square test, with the level of confidence at 95%Results and conclusions:1. Most women attend genetic counselling due the older age, family history with hereditary disease.2. Half of the patients would choose amniocentesis if there is found an in creased risk for genetic disease. One third would choose amniocentesis be cause of the genetic decision.3. Women, who do not agree with abortion, would like to get more informa tion about keeping pregnancy before conception.4. Most women (52%) would consult firstly with their husbands about the keeping the pregnancy. 16% would choose pregnancy termination, 10% would keep pregnancy.5. More than half of women would choose termination of pregnancy when fetus is diagnosed with disease incompatible with life. Other would choose to give birth and leave everything to natural course.",2014

The concept of informed consent is based on the principle of autonomy. The obligation of doctors to inform patients is inseparable from the requirement to receive informed consent. The two parts are mandatory for any medical procedures and interventions. The main requirements for the informed con sent include rationality, sufficient and clear information, free will and the form of consent conforming to the legal acts. However, the informed consent is not an absolute requirement as the patient has a right to remain unin formed.

22942,"Introduction: An important point of the genetic consulting is fixing a correct diagnosis, which most often requires the appointment and conduct of genetic research. Because of the hereditary nature of diseases and predispositions in our clinical practice when working with patients may result moral and ethical, psychological, social and legal cases and problems. Goals: The aim of our study is to investigate and analyze peoples personal position on the moral and ethi cal aspects of medical genetic consulting and conducting of genetic research. Materials and methods: In the study were included in general 140 people, aged from19 to 61 years, dominated by people aged between 20 and 22 years. The study was conducted on complete and voluntary and anonymous principles. Discussion: Significant contingent of respondents are positive about the con ducting of genetic testing and genetic consultation. Most of them think that good, empathic attitude of the physician to the patient and the strict observan ce of medical confidentiality is very important. For 57% of respondents appli cation of genetic test is a serious stressful situation, associated with a number of psycho emotional and moral ethical factors. Therefore, consistent with the characteristics of the patientÃ¢ÂÂs presentation and interpretation of the results of the conducted genetic tests is crucial for the beneficial effect from the counse ling itself. Conclusion: Genetic counseling requires abilities and approach to communicate, establishment of confidence and partnership between doctor and patient, correct presentation and interpretation of genetic information with respect for autonomy and the right of personal choice of the patient.",2014
22943,"Today the major guide for educators in establishing their teaching goals and objectives is BloomÃ¢ÂÂs Taxonomy of the Cognitive Domain revised by Krathwohl. From only knowing the specific concepts, students should then develop more and new skills, so that they could analyze, synthesize and even critically evalu ate their own work or their colleagues. During each workshop that I taught from October 2013 to January 2014 stu dents had to apply their knowledge to either create an original presentation (short story) or solve different problems. 100 first year students from the Medical and Pharmacy University Ã¢ÂÂCarol DavilaÃ¢ÂÂ answered 20 questions at the beginning of their training and corrected these during the last workshop, to prove that they have learned fundamental genetics. The answers were then corrected by a peer and in the end by the teacher. Workshops were intended to strengthen studentsÃ¢ÂÂ knowledge by means of creative thinking and also a lot of comparative approaches. Because I replaced the frontal teaching with group or individual activity, during workshops students had to apply the concepts of the lectures to explain a certain practical situation, showing they were able to use under new circumstances what they had previously learned. In the paper I discuss the comparative results and the degree to which stu dents discovered and corrected their own mistakes, being thus aware of their personal improvement in knowledge besides connecting with peers and lear ning to work in groups. The study demonstrates the achieved ability in understanding and interpre ting genetic information of the medical students.",2014
22944,"Growth is a multifactorial and complex process, yet its pattern is predictable in children. Deviations from normal pattern results in short stature which has serious psychological and social repercussions. Growth hormone (GH)/insu lin like growth factor I (IGF 1) axis has an established role in somatic growth regulation. Alterations impairing synthesis, secretion or biological action of GH results in a pathological phenotype called Growth Hormone Deficiency (GHD). GHD is eminently treatable, if supported by an early diagnosis and ti mely commencement of recombinant GH therapy which is highly expensive and prescribed over several years. In addition to the stigma of short stature, this exorbitant remedy is considered a burden by the patients in developing countries. High risk of inheritance in the next generation is also a matter of great concern. The present report on 100 families describes the impact of the disorder and socio economic concerns which are a decisive factor in opting for treatment. Families with one child affected with GHD were ardent to discern the recurrence in subsequent pregnancies based on which were willing for termination. The solution to this problem in developing countries is predictive genetic testing enabling early detection for treatment and prenatal diagnosis for prevention. Timely genotyping can be provided if the genetic spectrum is known in the population as variations in mutation type and prevalence are do cumented worldwide. Equipped with this knowledge identification of common mutations will be easier and faster reducing anguish, improving risk percepti on, providing quality life and thereby eliminating the burden of morbidity.",2014
22945,"With advancing genetic technologies, carrier screening for multiple inherited conditions can now be offered within the population. This research aimed to explore how women experience undergoing carrier screening for three com mon inherited conditions; cystic fibrosis (CF), spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) and fragile X syndrome (FXS), through the Victorian Clinical Genetics Services Reproductive Genetic Carrier Screening program. Adopting a qualitative ap proach using phenomenology as the theoretical framework, the study utilised in depth semi structured interviews, which were transcribed verbatim. The transcripts were coded using thematic analysis to identify emerging themes. Eight female participants took part: five received a carrier result for SMA and three for CF. The majority of participants were pregnant during screening and described the decision to have the test as straight forward. Participants experi enced emotional responses such as anxiety and stress whilst waiting for their partnerÃ¢ÂÂs test result and also completed online research to find out more about the relevant condition during this time. Participants were in favour of popu lation carrier screening, preferably offered prior to conception. The findings of this study elucidated that genetic counsellors (GCs) play an essential role within this program to adequately support couples after they receive a carrier result given the varying consent processes undertaken prior to screening. The implementation of Internet resources and GC facilitated guidance to access reliable online information is crucial to help empower couples and assist the coping process. Improving awareness of the availability of population carrier screening within the community will also help improve knowledge levels and facilitate preconception screening.",2014
