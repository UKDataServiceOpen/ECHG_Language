22948,"Long range gene regulation first became apparent in mammalian genomes through Mendelian disease genetics associated with extreme phenotypes in human, and developmental genetics in the mouse. It is now appreciated that long range enhancers found as far away as 1 megabase from their tar get gene and located either in intergenic regions or in introns are key in controlling the precise spatial and temporal expression of genes. Deletion, translocation or point mutations can abrogate the function of these ele ments in Rare Disease. However, the majority of human genetic variation associated with common and complex disease and quantitative traits also maps to intergenic regions that are likely the site of enhancers. Therefore, lessons learnt from studying enhancer dysfunction in rare disease will be important for an understanding of milder phenotypes. It is hard to envisage how distant enhancers function if one only considers the genome as a linear DNA sequence. Rather, three dimensional chromatin folding must play a fundamental role in enhancer promoter communication. I will describe our work using different experimental approaches to investi gate the three dimensional folding of the mammalian genome at genetically defined long range regulatory elements important in development.",2015

22950,"Our identification of biallelic hypomorphic mutations in three RNase H2 genes in the neuroinflammatory disorder, Aicardi GoutiÃÂ¨res syndrome led us to investigate enzyme complex they encode. We subsequently esta blished this is an important genome surveillance enzyme that removes over 1,000,000 ribonucleotides embedded in the genomic DNA of every repli cating mammalian cell. Such ribonucleotides represent the most common non canonical nucleotides incorporated into the genome by replicative polymerases and are an important potential source of genome instability. Furthermore, we have now exploited embedded ribonucleotides as a tool to trace the respective contribution of DNA polymerases, developing the technique emRiboSeq, and use this to implicate replicative polymerases as a determinant of local nucleotide substitution rates at functionally important sites, shaping the mutational landscape of the genome.",2015

Additional con genital anomalies are frequently associated. The etiology of this syndrome has been intensely debated and both teratogenic factors and genetic causes have been suggested. However, despite numerous clinical and molecular investigations since the description of the first patients in 1880 it has re mained elusive. Material and Methods: We hypothesized that de novo mutations contribute to the MBS phenotype and therefore performed exome sequencing in eight isolated MBS patients. All identified de novo variants were subsequently se quenced in a cohort of 103 MBS patients. The role of two candidate genes in MBS was addressed by morphological analysis of the knockout mouse brain. Results: We report de novo mutations in two different genes PLXND1 and REV3L. Analysis of the Plxnd1 and Rev3l knockout mice detected neuro pathological findings similar to those found in MBS. Strikingly, both mouse models exhibited a reduced number of motoneurons in the facial motor nu cleus, caused by defective neural migration in the Plxnd1 mutant mice or disrupted cellular proliferation in Rev3l heterozygous mice. Conclusions: Our study establishs for the first time a genetic cause for MBS. We show morphological alterations in Plxnd1 and Rev3l mutant mouse models simi lar to MBS patients clinical features. Although PLXND1 and REV3L are invol ved in different pathways a protein defect of any of them result in a decrease of the number of motoneurons in the facial motor nucleus.",2015

To pilot the implementation of paediatric genomic medicine we developed the SickKids Genome Clinic, a multidisciplinary project supporting research into clinical whole genome sequencing (WGS). The Genome Clinic conducts diagnostic WGS for 150+ children/year who are undergoing genetic eva luations. With parentsÃ¢ÂÂ permission, we search childrensÃ¢ÂÂ genomes for se condary medically actionable variants (MAVs) in 2800+ disease genes listed in the NIH Clinical Genomic Database. Of 321 families approached to date, 54% agreed to participate. 58% of par ticipants chose to learn their childÃ¢ÂÂs secondary adult onset MAVs. Among these parents, 68% decided to learn their own status for the same risk vari ants. Parents declining secondary variants were most concerned about psy chological burdens and/or insurance discrimination. Bioinformatics analysis of the first 80 patient genomes yielded 2382 candi date variants in 1117 genes that then underwent manual assessment (~30 variants/genome.) While ~15% were novel, the large majority of candida tes were listed in HGMD or ClinVar. Most variants listed in HGMD as disease causing failed manual assessment. E.g., >80% of variants found in the 56 ACMG genes and listed in HGMD as disease causing were rejected due to inadequate evidence of pathogenicity. We identified 7 reportable variants in the 56 ACMG genes in our first 80 patients (~9%). By expanding our search to 2800+ genes we are finding secondary MAVs in >25% of children, ~40% of which lie in genes for adult onset disorders. We conclude that parental opinions vary widely regarding return of secondary variants, children may harbour more secondary MAVs than adults, and disease prevalence and imperfect variant interpretation constrain the number of reportable secondary MAVs.",2015

Kabuki syndrome (KS) is a genetic disorder characterized by developmental delay and multiple congenital anomalies. KS is caused primarily by mutations in KMT2D (MLL2), a methyltransferase that promotes active transcription and, more rarely, in KDM6A , a demethylase of the KMT2D complex. Although the functions of chromatin modifying proteins have been well studied, the physiological systems regulated by them are largely unknown. Using who le exome sequencing we found a mutation converted to homozygosity by uniparental isodisomy (UPD) in RAP1A in a patient with KS, and a de novo dominant mutation in the closely related gene RAP1B in a second patient. We show that suppression of each of RAP1 (RAP1A and RAP1B ), KMT2D , and KDM6A leads to defective convergent extension (CE) movements and to context dependent MAPK signaling dysfunction. We further show that RAP1 interacts genetically with KMT2D and that RAP1B expression is downregu lated in both kmt2d morphant zebrafish (zf) embryos and KMT2D deficient patient cells. Regarding the frequent skeletal abnormalities in KS, we de monstrate that depletion of KS genes affects the layout of the pharyngeal skeleton in zf by disturbed F actin polymerization and cell cell intercalation. Interestingly, the CE and skeletal defects could be rescued in vivo by a small molecule MAPK inhibitor. Taken together, this study (i) identifies RAP1A and RAP1B as two novel genes for KS, (ii) reveals the first evidence that defective MEK ERK signaling is a common molecular driver for KS, (iii) suggests that KS is a member of the RASopathy spectrum, and (iv) provides a potential direction for treatment design.

Mammalian genomes are organized into megabase scale topologically as sociated domains (TADs) that have been proposed to partition the genome into large regulatory units. Here we demonstrate that the disruption of TAD structure can cause rewiring of functional interactions between genes and distant acting enhancers, resulting in pathogenic phenotypes in humans and mice. We show that distinct limb malformations in human patients are caused by deletions, inversions or duplications altering the structure of the extended WNT6/IHH/EPHA4/PAX3 locus. To examine these variants in de tail, we adapted CRISPR genome editing to generate mice with correspon ding large rearrangements. 4C seq in mouse limb tissue and patient derived fibroblasts showed that the structural changes result in ectopic interactions between promoters and non coding DNA across adjacent TADs. On the di sease alleles, a cluster of limb enhancers normally associated with Epha4 is misplaced relative to TAD boundaries, causing it to interact with and drive ectopic limb expression of Wnt6, Ihh or Pax3, respectively. Taken together, our results demonstrate the critical importance of TADs for the functional orchestration of the genome in vivo and support their utility in predicting the pathogenicity of human structural variants.",2015
22955,"Introduction: Patients diagnosed with adenomatous polyposis, i.e., the con stitutive development of multiple colorectal adenomatous polyps, are at an increased risk to develop colorectal cancer (CRC). Currently, two adenoma tous polyposis associated syndromes are known: familial adenomatous po lyposis (FAP) and MUTYH associated polyposis (MAP). Whereas monoallelic APC germline mutations underlie FAP , MAP is caused by biallelic germline mutations in the base excision repair (BER) gene MUTYH. No other causati ve genes have been identified and, therefore, a considerable fraction of ade nomatous polyposis patients remains unexplained Materials and Methods: Whole exome sequencing was applied to germline DNA derived from 51 individuals (from 48 families) with multiple colonic adenomas. After candidate gene selection, co segregation analyses were performed. The somatic mutation spectrum of carcinomas and adenomas was determined by sequencing of 409 cancer related genes and by targeted deep sequencing of the APC gene, respectively. Results: We identified a homozygous germline nonsense mutation in the BER gene NTHL1 in seven affected individuals from three unrelated families. All three families showed recessive inheritance of the adenomatous polyposis phenotype, which was consistently and exclusively encountered in homozy gous carriers, indicating a high penetrant predisposing effect. In controls, this germline mutation was only found in a heterozygous state (MAF 0.0036, n,2,329). Sequence analysis of carcinomas and adenomas from different af fected homozygous carriers revealed a non hypermutated profile enriched for C to T transitions, in line with a germline BER defect. Conclusions: We show for the first time that a homozygous loss of function germline mutation in the NTHL1 gene predisposes to a novel subtype of BER associated adenomatous polyposis and CRC.",2015
22956,"Every human genome harbors hundreds of slightly deleterious mutations. Even though most of these mutations have each a small effect, their cumu lative effect (mutation load) could substantially reduce the fitness of an in dividual. Here we investigate an interaction between a severely deleterious mutation and the mutation load, formulating the genetic handicap principle: an individual bearing a severely deleterious variant (genetic handicap) is viable only if the genome wide mutation load is sufficiently low. We deve lop a population genetic model, which predicts that live born individuals carrying a handicap mutation (causing, for example, 50 90% probability of miscarriage) show a reduction (5 20%) in their number of slightly delete rious mutations as compared to controls. To test this prediction, we used data on trisomy of chromosome 21 (T21), a frequent chromosomal abnor mality in humans which is associated with high miscarriage rates. Three evi dences support the view that live born T21 individuals have lower mutation load than the euploid population: (i) there is a deficit of homozygotes for rare derived alleles in the T21 cohort (N,338); (ii) the T21 cohort shows on chromosome 21 a deficit of gain of expression and an excess of loss of ex pression regulatory variants that can partially compensate the effect of tri somy; (iii) inter individual whole transcriptome variation in fibroblasts of the live born T21 individuals (N,8) is lower than it is in the control cohort (N,8), reflecting potential selection against T21 fetuses with non optimal pattern of expression. We conclude that the negative fitness consequences of severe mutations such as trisomy can be partially compensated by a re duced mutation load.",2015

22962,"There are a number of circumstances in which a child or adolescent may be identified, either unintentionally or intentionally, as a carrier for a recessive condition. These are: following newborn screening (NBS) when the test also reveals carrier results; as a secondary or incidental finding from investiga tions into an existing unrelated condition; cascade testing when another fa mily member, especially a sibling, is identified with a genetic condition (or as a carrier through NBS); as a result of prenatal testing by carrier parents; population based or ethnicity targeted carrier screening of adolescents, most typically in high school. Since the purpose of carrier testing is to pro vide information for future reproductive planning, guidelines have traditio nally recommended against carrier genetic testing of minors, yet testing in each of the above circumstances has occurred and, in some instances, for many years. Arguments against carrier testing include: not being in the best interest of the child because it denies the childÃ¢ÂÂs future autonomy and removes their right to decide testing for themselves; the potential for psychological, emotional and social harms, such as stigma and discrimination; possibility for misun derstanding the meaning of carrier status; uncertainty whether testing at a young age would result in future reproductive behaviour. On the other hand, many parents have indicated they would want to know their childÃ¢ÂÂs carrier status and arguments in favour acknowledge that parents make health care decisions regularly for their child, and that the childÃ¢ÂÂs interest is inevitably intertwined with those of the parents and the family. Knowledge of a childÃ¢ÂÂs carrier status from newborn screening could be used by parents for their own future reproductive decisions. Learning carrier status as a young child allows them to adapt to the information and, as an older child, the infor mation can increase reproductive options before they are sexually active. Proponents have also commented that there is a lack of evidence of harm to the child while others have called for more empirical research. These arguments will be further elaborated and research will be highlighted that has examined the ethical and psychosocial aspects of carrier testing in children and adolescents in the various circumstances described above.",2015
22963,"Phenotypic variation results from genetic variation, epigenetic variation, en vironmental variation and cultural variation. While it is well established that we inherit our genes, our environment and our culture from our parents, it is less clear whether we also inherit epigenetic information. There is good evidence for epigenetic programming of the fetus by the maternal environ ment (mainly maternal glucose and hormone levels), but the transmission of epigenetic information through germ cells is a matter of debate. Epigene tic inheritance has been observed in plants and lower animals, but in mam mals it faces two barriers: 1. the early separation of the soma and germ line (Weismann barrier) and 2. the epigenetic reprogramming of the genome du ring germ cell development and during early embryogenesis. Studies on epi genetic inheritance are hampered by the problem to distinguish epigenetic variants that have been transmitted through the germ line from epigenetic variants that arise anew in each generation as a consequence of inherited genetic, environmental or cultural variants. In fact, several reports on he ritable germline epimutations have failed to recognize the presence of an underlying genetic mutation. On the other hand, it has been shown in rare cases that epigenetic states can by accident survive reprogramming in the germline. In these cases heritable epigenetic variation is most probably random and not adaptive. Nevertheless, it can be subject of selection.",2015
22964,"One in five women in the UK is obese (body mass index BMI>30kg/m2) at antenatal booking. Maternal obesity is associated with complications for the mother including increased risk of developing gestational diabe tes, pre eclampsia and need for caesarean section. For the offspring short term complications include risk of macrosomia and need for admission to the neonatal unit. It is now apparent that the effects of maternal obesity for the offspring extend beyond the neonatal period with increased risk of obe sity in childhood, adolescence and adult life. In addition there are risks of metabolic disturbance in childhood and young adulthood including glucose intolerance, hypertension and dyslipidaemia. In a record linkage study we demonstrated that maternal obesity is associated with increased risk of pre mature mortality and hospital admissions for cardiovascular events in her adult offspring. Animal models suggest the adverse effects of maternal obe sity on offspring outcomes are Ã¢ÂÂprogrammedÃ¢ÂÂ in utero. To investigate under lying mechanisms we have been carrying out a case control study of very se verely obese pregnant women (BMI>40kg/m2) vs. normal weight controls.

22966,"Removal of noncoding intron sequences from the primary transcripts by the spliceosome is an essential step in eukaryotic gene expression pathway. Spliceosome is a molecular machine composed of five small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs) and numerous integral protein components. Human cells contain two separate spliceosomes, called as U2 and U12 dependent spliceosomes. U2 type spliceosome excises 99.5% of all introns in humans, while the U12 dependent spliceosome concentrates of a highly conserved subset of introns (termed as U12 type introns) that are found from approximately 700 800 genes in humans. In addition to the essential role in generating functional mRNA molecu les, the pre mRNA splicing reaction serves also an important regulatory function. In a process called alternative splicing multiple mRNA isoforms are formed from a single gene. Alternative splicing is regulated through a number of non spliceosomal protein components that can bind to regula tory sequences present in exon and intron sequences. Together with RNA secondary structure and chromatin modifications this leads to formation multiple mRNA species from a single gene that increases protein diversity but also provide important regulatory functions through regulating the sta bility of mRNA molecules. A large number of human diseases are caused by defects in the pre mRNA splicing process. Most common are mutations in either the splices site se quences located at intron exon boundaries, or in the regulatory elements (splicing enhancers or suppressors) located in the exons or introns. Such mutations result in defects in pre mRNA splicing that affect single gene only. In contrast, mutations in the components of the pre mRNA splicing machin ery lead to complex pleiotropic effects and affect the pre mRNA processing in large number genes. In my presentation I will describe the basic mechanism of intron recognition and splicing process. I will use the human disease causing mutations in the U12 dependent spliceosome to illustrate the effects that splicing machinery mutations have on pre mRNA processing.",2015

The millions of Down syndrome patients across the world also face multiple other health issues, including congenital cardiac defects, high incidence of Early onset Alzheimer disease, and hematopoietic disorders. Given that Down syndro me is caused by an extra copy of chromosome 21 that involves over dosage of 400 genes across a whole chromosome, it precludes any possibility of a genetic therapy. Our lab has long studied the natural dosage compensati on mechanism for X chromosome inactivation. To Ã¢ÂÂdosage compensateÃ¢ÂÂ X linked genes between females and males, the X linked XIST gene produces a large non coding RNA that silences one of the two X chromosomes in female cells. The initial motivation of this study was to translate the natural mecha nisms of X chromosome inactivation into chromosome therapy for Down syndrome. Using zinc finger nuclease technology, we have successfully in serted a large XIST transgene into Chromosome 21 in Down syndrome iPS cells, which results in chromosome wide transcriptional silencing of the ex tra Chromosome 21. Remarkably, deficits in proliferation and neural growth are rapidly reversed upon silencing one chromosome 21. Successful trisomy silencing in vitro surmounts the major first step towards potential develop ment of Ã¢ÂÂchromosome therapyÃ¢ÂÂ for Down syndrome.

It is estimated that over 1 million noninvasive prenatal tests for chromosomal aneuploidies have been performed.

The chromosome dosage can be accurately determined by counting the number of sequen ced plasma DNA molecules mapping to the individual chromosomes. The sensitivities and specificities of this approach are remarkable for detecting trisomies 13, 18 and 21 in large scale studies. However, this approach is re commended as a screening test and further confirmation of positive results by testing of fetal tissues obtained invasive procedures is recommended.

22970,"SophiaÃ¢ÂÂs ChildrenÃ¢ÂÂs Hospital, Athens, Greece. The primary aim of aneuploidy screening preimplantation embryos is to optimize outcomes in couples undergoing infertility treatment. Since the first in vitro fertilization (IVF) cycle performed in 1978, it is estimated that over 5 million babies have been born following IVF. However, only about one third of IVF cycles result in the birth of a baby. Selection of IVF embryos most likely to implant is traditionally based on embryo morphology, although this is relatively imprecise. Based on observations that aneuploidies in clinical miscarriages increase with advanced maternal age (AMA), that aneuploidies are found in preimplantation IVF embryos and that most aneuploidies are incompatible with life, a rationale was developed to improve IVF pregnancy rates through selecting chromosomally normal embryos for embryo trans fer. This procedure, usually called Preimplantation Genetic Screening (PGS), was initially applied 20 years ago for AMA, using FISH to analyze select chro mosomes in single blastomeres biopsied from 3 day embryos (PGS version 1, PGS 1). Indications for PGS were subsequently widened to couples under going IVF for repeated implantation failure, spontaneous abortions and severe male infertility. However, following 10 years of clinical application, evidence from randomized trials did not support a clear benefit of PGS 1 (FISH on blastomeres). Reasons likely include high rates of mosaicism in day 3 preimplantation embryos, the inability of FISH to analyse all chromo somes in a single cell and possibly a negative impact of blastomere biopsy itself. Subsequent PGS strategies use 24 chromosome array CGH analysis on biopsied polar bodies or trophectoderm biopsies from blastocyst stage embryos (PGS 2). Good randomized control trials are challenging, involving stringent patient recruitment, satisfactory patient numbers, monitoring all procedures/protocols, time and expense. The few on going or recently pu blished randomized trials have not yet clarified the optimum strategy and specific benefits (if any) of aneuploidy screening preimplantation embryos.

The TERT promoter mutations have now been shown to be widespread in many cancer types and have been regularly associated with an increased gene expression and adverse forms of the disease. In bladder cancer, we de monstrated an association of the TERT promoter mutations with a poor pa tient survival and an increased disease recurrence (Rachakonda et al. PNAS 2013, 110:17426 31).

This includes the severe multi system disorders Hoyer aal Hreidarsson and Revesz syndromes as well as a subset of patients with aplastic anaemia, myelodysplasia, leukaemia, liver disease and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. This wide spectrum of diseases ranging from classical DC to aplastic anaemia can be regarded as disorders of defective telomere maintenance Ã¢ÂÂthe telomereopathiesÃ¢ÂÂ.ABSTRACTS SYMPOSIA ESHG 2015 | GLASGOW, SCOTLAND, UK | WWW. ESHG. ORG 10Back to inde x Some cases of DC still remain uncharacterized. Using whole exome sequen cing we have identified novel biallelic mutations in the poly(A) specific ri bonuclease (PARN ) gene, in families exhibiting severe DC. PARN is an exo nuclease whose deadenylation activity in part controls mRNA stability and therefore regulation of a large number of genes. The mutations identified affect key domains within the protein and studies on patient cells show re duced deadenylation activity. This deficiency causes an early DNA damage response, cell cycle arrest and reduced cell viability upon UV treatment. In dividuals with biallelic PARN mutations and cells that are depleted of PARN have reduced RNA levels for several key genes associated with telomere bio logy (TERC, DKC1, RTEL1 and TERF1 ). They also possess critically short telo meres. Collectively, these results identify a role for PARN in telomere main tenance and demonstrate that it is a new disease causing gene in a subset of cases with severe DC.",2015

22981,"Human primary or essential hypertension is a complex, polygenic trait with some 50% contribution from genes and environment. Richard Lifton and colleagues provided elegant dissection of several rare Mendelian forms of hypertension, exemplified by the glucocorticoid remediable aldosteronism and LiddleÃ¢ÂÂs syndrome. These discoveries illustrate that a single gene muta tion can explain the entire pathogenesis of severe, early onset hypertension as well as dictating the best treatment. The dissection of the much more common polygenic hypertension has pro ven much more difficult. Early studies used a single polymorphic marker such as the I/D polymorphism in the ACE gene and small numbers of ca ses and controls. Candidate gene studies have been largely non informative and non reproducible. These were followed by linkage studies, which used approximately 300 microsatellite markers distributed across the genome. These studies resulted in large peaks covering regions with 50 100 genes, with no easy way to quickly focus on a few genes of causal relevance. The real breakthrough came with the initiation of the genome wide associati on studies (GWAS) characterised by a much more thorough coverage of the genome with thousands single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Typi cally 500,000 2,5000,000 SNPs have been used for the big, collaborative GWAS for hypertension. These studies resulted in several Ã¢ÂÂhitsÃ¢ÂÂ or signals with a genome wide significance and a high level of reproducibility between studies. These Ã¢ÂÂhitsÃ¢ÂÂ have been used successfully to calculate genetic risk scores for cardiovascular complications such as left ventricular hypertrophy, stroke and coronary artery disease. Intragenic signals, such as for example Uromodulin, are being used to examine new pathways for cardiovascular protection and possibly new targets for drug discovery. The next steps in genomic medicine belong to a combination of the next ge neration sequencing (NGS) and its linkage with electronic health records, including preferably the real time clinical data, biochemistry, imaging, histo logy as well as longitudinal health outcomes.

Background: High plasma levels of nonfasting triglycerides are associated with increased risk of ischemic cardiovascular disease. Whether lifelong low levels of nonfasting triglycerides, due to mutations in the gene for apolipo protein C3 (APOC3), associate with reduced risk of ischemic cardiovascular disease in the general population is unknown. This is important, because APOC3 is a potential drug target for reducing residual cardiovascular risk. Methods: Using 75,725 individuals from two general population studies, we first tested whether low levels of nonfasting triglycerides were associated with reduced risk of ischemic vascular disease and ischemic heart disea se. Second, we tested whether loss of function mutations in APOC3, which were associated with reduced levels of nonfasting triglycerides, were also associated with reduced risk of ischemic vascular disease and ischemic heart disease. During follow up, 10,797 individuals developed ischemic vas cular disease, of whom 7,557 developed ischemic heart disease. ABSTRACTS SYMPOSIA ESHG 2015 | GLASGOW, SCOTLAND, UK | WWW. ESHG.

Heterozygosity for loss of function mutations in APOC3 was associated with mean reductions in plasma nonfasting trigly cerides of 44% (P,2x10 54). The cumulative incidence of ischemic vascular disease and ischemic heart disease was reduced in heterozygotes (P,0.009 and 0.05, respectively), with corresponding risk reductions of, respectively, 41% (HR: 0.59; 95% CI, 0.41 0.86; P,0.007) and 36% (HR: 0.64; 95% CI, 0.41 0.99; P,0.04).Conclusions: Loss of function mutations in APOC3 are associated with low levels of triglycerides, and with reduced risk of ischemic cardiovascular di sease.

22984,"Long Interspersed Element 1 (LINE 1 or L1) is a family of active non LTR retrotransposons that comprise around a fifth of our genome. Despite this substantial representation, an average human genome only contains 80 100 actively mobile or retrotransposition competent L1s (RC L1s). The mobili ty of RC L1s continues to impact germline and somatic genomes and can lead to human genetic disease. L1 retrotransposition normally occurs by a mechanism known as target site primed reverse transcription (TPRT), which requires both the L1 encoded endonuclease and reverse transcripta se activities. However, it has been reported that L1 can mobilize through an endonuclease independent pathway (ENi), in which the element inserts at sites of DNA disrepair. Notably, recent data from our lab has demonstrated that the mobilization of L1 is de regulated in Fanconi Anemia (FA) patients, including the ENi pathway. FA is a rare disease characterized by infant mor tality and genomic instability, suggesting that de regulated LINE 1 retro transposition may affect genomic fluidity in FA patients.",2015

Defining the cell autonomous processes that underly BAT differentiation and activation may thus reveal novel therapeutic targets for obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus interventi on. Here we show that ageing and obesity associated demises in BAT func tion coincide with coordinate down regulation of mature microRNAs in BAT in the presence of reduced expression of the microRNA processing enzyme Dicer1. To mimic this partial down regulation of microRNA processing in obesity and ageing, we inactivated one allele of Dicer1 selectively in BAT of mice. BAT selective heterozygosity of Dicer1 caused glucose intolerance in lean mice and aggravated diet induced obesity (DIO) evoked deterioration of glucose homeostasis. Using combinatorial analyses of altered microRNA expression in BAT during in vitro brown preadipocyte commitment and mouse models of premature ageing, longevity and DIO, we identified 23 mi croRNAs dysregulated among these conditions. Of these, we identified miR 328 as a novel regulator of BAT differentiation. miR 328 over expression promotes BAT differentiation and impairs muscle progenitor commitment, while reducing miR 328 expression blocks brown but not white adipocyte differentiation. We validated the ÃÂ Secretase Bace1 as a target of miR 328, which is consequently over expressed in BAT of obese and premature ag eing mice. Reducing Bace1 expression enhances brown adipocyte, while impairing myogenic differentiation in vitro. In vivo small molecule Bace1 inhibition in obese mice delayed DIO induced weight gain, ameliorated obe sity associated deterioration of glucose metabolism and improved insulin sensitivity. Collectively, these experiments reveal reduced Dicer1 miR 328 Bace1 axis in presence of generalized impairment of microRNA processing in ageing and obesity as a novel determinant of ageing and obesity asso ciated decline in BAT function. This may define in vivo Bace1 inhibition as an innovative therapeutic approach to not only target age related neurode generative diseases but at the same time improving age related impairment of BAT function and metabolism.",2015

Here we show that pathogenic Opa1 triggers a localized accumulation of autophagosomes that filters mitochondria out from RGC axons. Mitochondrial dysfunction caused by mutated Opa1 results in localized AMPK activation and downstream axonal hillock autophagoso me accumulation.

22989,"MNGIE (mitochondrial neurogastrointestinal encephalomyopathy) is a mi tochondrial disease caused by mutations in the nuclear gene TYMP, enco ding thymidine phosphorylase (TP). In recent years, knowledge gained from basic research on the biochemical mechanisms involved in this disorder has allowed us to design plausible therapy approaches. In MNGIE patients, TP dysfunction leads to systemic overload of the nucleosides thymidine and deoxyuridine, which results in alteration of the homeostasis of mitochondri al deoxyribonucleoside triphosphate (dNTP) pool. This imbalance interferes the correct replication of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). As a consequence, mtDNA depletion, multiple deletions and somatic point mutations occur in several tissues in patients, ultimately leading to mitochondrial dysfunction. As the clinical phenotype of MNGIE is the result of the toxic accumulation of thymidine and deoxyuridine, therapy approaches have focused on clearing the systemic overload of these nucleosides. First attempts to use hemodia lysis failed to reduce nucleoside overload because of the high rate of endo genous production of these compounds by human metabolism. By contrast, hematopoetic stem cell transplantation restored nucleoside homeostasis in patients with successful engraftment, and led to slow clinical improvement. However, the high morbidity and mortality rates associated to the proce dure encouraged us to find alternatives, and the most obvious one, gene therapy, has given very promising results in a murine model of the disease. Two different vectors carrying the human TYMP gene (a lentiviral vector transduced to hematopoietic stem cells, and an adeno associated virus vec tor with targeted expression in liver) have been tested in a murine model of the disease. In both cases, successful and long term stable expression of the transgene was achieved, resulting in permanent reduction of nucleoside overload in vivo. These results demonstrate that gene therapy is a feasible option for MNGIE patients; therefore, clinical trials should be implemented to investigate the safety and efficacy of this option.

22990,"The extensive genetic and allelic heterogeneity observed with congenital eye diseases is a major barrier to the development of therapeutics. Leber congenital amaurosis is a typical example where more than 400 mutations have been identified in at least 19 different genes. Conversely, more than 600 mutations in a single gene (PAX6) cause aniridia. Developing treatments for each affected gene remains a significant challenge and would have to overcome the ethical and technical barriers associated with the delivery of a preventative prenatal treatment. To overcome these issues we have taken advantage of the observation that approximately 12% of all disease causing mutations are nonsense mutations leading to premature stop codons. Our approach has therefore focussed on pharmacological strategies that speci fically target nonsense mutations and are gene independent. In our recent work we used systemic prenatal and postnatal nonsense suppression to cor rect the underlying genetic defects in choroideremia, ocular coloboma, ani ridia, retinitis pigmentosa and most recently Leber congenital amaurosis. During these studies we developed a topical eye drop formulation (called START therapy) containing the nonsense suppression drug Ataluren that we tested in a mouse model of aniridia. Topical delivery not only reversed the malformation defects it also restored the electrical and behavioral respon ses of the retina. Further studies on the efficacy of this postnatal treatment have shown that the eye responds to changes in Pax6 dosage over a specific time window. These studies suggest that the eye retains significant develop mental plasticity into the post natal period and therefore postnatal thera peutic strategies delivered early in life could now be considered as potenti ally practical for some congenital eye abnormalities. Not only would topical drug delivery avoid the issue of systemic toxicity, but would likely lead to high compliance in young children. Furthermore, this approach would be relevant to new mutations that spontaneously occur without family history.",2015

Impaired mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation, bioenergetics imbalance, deficit of Fe S cluster enzymes and mitochondrial iron overload occur in individuals with FRDA. To date there are not effective treatment for FRDA, and cardiac failure is the most common cuase of mortality in FRDA.

Recent examples involve mutation of non coding RNA genes (such as the deletions observed at the mir17 92 cluster in Feingold syndrome), but also regulatory DNA alterations that we will discuss as: Enhancer variants located within or close to a gene, such as a genomic variant in a highly conserved sequence located in a non coding region of the RET gene, altering the binding of a transcription factor expressed in neu ral crest cell precursors to the enteric nervous system, which predispose to Hirschsprung disease. Long distance disruption of CNCs, whatever their function, such as those observed on both side of the SOX9 gene coding sequences in either Pierre Robin sequence (PRS), a common orofacial cleft anomaly with mandibular hypoplasia, or isolated disorders of sex determination (DSDs). In these ca ses, the disruption of distant tissue specific regulatory elements, required for the normal development of either the mandibula or the gonads, perturbs embryonic expression of SOX9 and could account for the PRS or DSD pheno types respectively, as these evolutionarily constrained regions may be dis rupted in a modular fashion.

22996,"As mutations are at the origin of all genetic variations, understanding the factors that influence the apparent rate at which de novo mutations occur is crucial to the study of genome diversity, evolution and diseases. Although it is well established that point mutations initially arise as random miscopying events, preferentially from the paternal germline, we have described a new mechanism which predicts that certain pathogenic mutations may hijack the way sperm production is controlled to their own advantage. In doing so, these Ã¢ÂÂselfishÃ¢ÂÂ mutations become progressively enriched in the testis as men age and are therefore associated with an increased risk of transmission to the next generation. The concept of selfish spermatogonial selection was originally proposed to account for the unusual presentation of a group of rare Mendelian diseases, which we collectively called Ã¢ÂÂpaternal age effect disordersÃ¢ÂÂ. It relies on prin ciples similar to oncogenesis to explain why some paternally derived muta tions, such as those causing Apert (FGFR2) and Costello (HRAS) syndromes or achondroplasia (FGFR3), occur spontaneously at levels up to 1000 fold higher than the genomic background rate. The evidence gathered original ly through direct quantification of these ultra rare pathogenic mutations in human sperm suggests that selfish mutations, although occurring rarely, confer a selective advantage to mutant spermatogonial stem cells, leading to their clonal expansion and progressive enrichment in sperm over time. Our understanding of this process so far suggests that molecularly selfish selection relies on the activation of the growth factor receptor RAS signal ling pathway, which is a key regulator of stem cell homeostasis in the testis. As RAS is required in many different cellular contexts, we will discuss to which extend dysregulation of this pathway is likely to be relevant to the pathology of common disorders, including cancer predisposition and neu rodevelopmental disorders, such as schizophrenia and autism for which paternal age effects have been described epidemiologically.",2015

The system is efficient, versatile and easily programmable. Originally, CRISPR Cas is an RNA mediated adaptive immune system that protects bacteria and archaea from invading mobile genetic elements (pha ges, plasmids). Short crRNA (CRISPR RNA) molecules containing unique ge nome targeting spacers commonly guide Cas protein(s) to invading cognate nucleic acids to affect their maintenance. CRISPR Cas has been classified into three main types and further subtypes. CRISPR Cas9 originates from the type II CRISPR Cas system that has evolved unique molecular mechanis ms for maturation of crRNAs and targeting of invading DNA, which my labo ratory has identified in the human pathogen Streptococcus pyogenes. During the step of crRNA biogenesis, a unique CRISPR associated RNA, tracrRNA, base pairs with the repeats of precursor crRNA to form anti repeat repeat dual RNAs that are cleaved by RNase III in the presence of Cas9 (formerly Csn1), generating mature tracrRNA and intermediate forms of crRNAs.

It is estimated that in the EU 5,000 8,000 rare diseases affect 27 36 million people (6 8% of the population). The EU objectives in the field of rare diseases have been defined in order to assemble all the elements necessary for a global strategy to tackle rare diseases efficiently. The foremost aim is to improve patientsÃ¢ÂÂ chances of ob taining the most appropriate and timely diagnosis, information and care on the assumption that this aim can be achieved more effectively through colla borative, European action than by the Member States individually. Most EU policies do not differ significantly from what most Member States already have in place and these policies should not incur an extra burden for the Member States, particularly those with greater economic challenges and less developed health systems. In a nutshell, EU rare disease policies are aiming to make rare diseases more visible through the promotion of an appropriate coding system that will allow the correct and prompt identification of patients. Other key aspects include the development and implementation of National Plans to ensu re equal access to prevention, diagnosis, treatment and rehabilitation for people with rare diseases. In general, the European rare diseases policies ensure that common guidelines are developed and shared everywhere in Europe for areas such as research, centres of expertise, development of or phan drugs etc. The concept of European reference networks (ERNs) for rare diseases is one of the latest instruments provided by the EC to tackle rare diseases requiring specialised care. They should serve as research and knowledge networks, treating patients from other Member States and ensuring the availability of subsequent treatment facilities where necessary. This concept will certainly support the implementation of the Ã¢ÂÂCross Border Healthcare DirectiveÃ¢ÂÂ and the equity of care for patients according to the state of the art; however, it will also be the measure that will likely inflict greater financial cost on Mem ber States. To establish effective ERNs will require not only technical but also financial resources coupled with an EU wide spirit of cooperation.",2015

There has been a significant amount of research into developing objective quantification methods to leverage clinician expertise. I will give a brief introduction to imaging based computational phenotyping research, touching on the morphometrics, anthropometry, 3D imaging mo dalities, and syndrome classification. Recent developments in computer vision research have begun to enable analyses based on ordinary photographs to be performed for the purpose of computational phenotyping. I will present Clinical Face Phenotype Space (CFPS), an algorithm to automatically detect faces in photographs, annotate locations of key anatomical parts and extract machine readable feature de scriptions of the facial gestalt. The approach uses machine learning to create a multidimensional space shaped to account for spurious variations such as lighting, pose, occlusions, and image quality. The CFPS locates patients in the context of known syndromes, and thus can help generating disease hypothe ses. This holds promise as an impartial means of narrowing the search space to suspected rare diseases, and could augment the prioritisation of testing in clinical investigations. Moreover, CFPS allows the clustering of patients by phenotype even when no known syndrome diagnosis exists, thereby aiding disease identification.

23012,"Imprinted genes are expressed from a single parental allele and are the main reason why mammals require both a maternal and paternal contribution for normal development. Defects in imprinted gene expression or loss of a sin gle allele of an imprinted gene are responsible for a number of human syn dromes, including Prader Willi Syndrome, Angelman Syndrome, Beckwith Wiedemann Syndrome and Silver Russell Syndrome. There are fewer than 200 imprinted genes that have been described thus far in mice. The imprin ted expression and regulation of these genes is largely conserved between rodents and humans, which allows mechanistic studies of this most unusual form of gene expression using both animal models and human tissues and cell models. Most imprinted genes reside in clusters that are located throug hout the mammalian genome. The clusters typically contain an imprinting control region (ICR), which harbors allele specific DNA methylation and governs the imprinting of the entire domain. Deletion or inappropriate epi genetic modifications of the ICR causes deregulation of the entire cluster in cis. Although most imprinted clusters use long non coding RNAs to regulate imprinted gene expression, a few are regulated by CTCF and allele specific insulator function. One such cluster harbors the H19 and Igf2 imprinted ge nes, and is controlled by an ICR that contains multiple CTCF binding sites. Gain of maternal methylation and loss of paternal hypermethylation of the H19/IGF2 ICR are associated with the human growth disorders Beckwith Wiedemann Syndrome and Silver Russell Syndrome, respectively. Using gene targeting and genome editing, we have generated ES cells, iPS cell lines and mice to study the mechanisms of imprinting for these imprinted loci and to model the epigenetic mutations in human syndromes. We have also developed SNP FISH to study the dynamics of allele specific gene expression at the single cell level in cell lines and tissues exhibiting loss of imprinting.",2015
23013,"Genomic imprinting is a good example of epigenetic regulation of gene ex pression. Imprinted genes are characterised by expression from only one allele (of the pair) in a consistent parent of origin manner; often only in cer tain developmental windows and in some tissues of the body. The pattern is set by targeted methylation within the male or female germ line that resists the post fertilisation waves of demethylation of the zygote. Imprinted genes play an important role in fetal growth and development. Their carefully re gulated expression is important for normal cellular metabolism and human behaviour. Imprinting Disorders. A genetic or epigenetic mutation that impacts imprinting expression can result in one of eight clinically recognisable disorders: 1. Silver Russell syndrome chrm 7, 11p15 (Growth restriction, asymmetry) 2. Transient Neonatal Diabetes Mellitus (TNDM)6q24 (Transient neonatal diabetes, intrauterine growth retardation, diabe tes) 3.

23014,"Introduction: In the Netherlands euthanasia or physician assisted suicide (PAS) is legal since 2002 under strict conditions. Euthanasia or PAS is ex empt from prosecution when the euthanasia or PAS is performed by a phy sician after a direct request from a patient or based on an advance directive. Furthermore the physician must be convinced that the patient suffers unbe arable and without prospect or relief. HuntingtonÃ¢ÂÂs Disease (HD) is an autosomal dominant progressive neuro degenerative disease, characterized by chorea and hypokinesia, psychiatric symptoms and progressive cognitive decline leading to dementia. In The Netherlands approximately 1,700 patients have HD and another 6,000 8,000 persons are at risk. Primary cause of death is pneumonia, second cause is suicide. Each year approximately 7 requests for euthanasia from a HD patient are granted. We have observed an increase in conversations about wishes for the end of life between physicians and patients, but this was never investigated. Objective: to investigate presence and content of wishes for the end of life amongst HD patients, and the relationship with demographic or disease specific characteristics. Methods: First, 14 patients in different stages of the disease and 15 physi cians were interviewed. Based on the qualitative research a custom made questionnaire was developed and sent to 242 Dutch patients registered in the Leiden HD Registry Database. Information on demographic variables and clinical characteristics such as TFC, MMSE, UHDRS M was collected. Results: The interviews showed that most patients had strong ideas about things they do not want for the end of their life because of their experiences with family members. Knowledge about how to effectuate the wishes ( for example the role of the physician or family and the value of the advance directive) was in some of them inadequate or lacking. In general, conversa tions about wishes for the end of life were not initiated by physicians. Phy sicians reported problems how to deal with an advance directive especially in light of cognitive decline, psychiatric symptoms and signs and Ã¢ÂÂresponse shiftÃ¢ÂÂ.The questionnaire was returned by 134 patients (55.4%) of whom 101 (75%) reported to have some kind of thoughts for the end of life. These thoughts concerned care (11%) and ; thoughts about euthanasia or PAS (64%). The presence of thoughts about the end of life was related to being familiar with HD but not to any other socio demographic or clinical variable. Conclusion: Thoughts about and wishes for the end of life are widely pre sent amongst patients with HD and known gene carriers and these thoughts or wishes concern euthanasia or PAS in a majority of the respondents.

As a result, keeping track of all the care and decisions that preceded the current moment in time is essential to understand how the population of infants being observed came into existence, and to what we can validly infer from comparisons of groups of infants. And as our ability to intervene in the lives and deaths of these pa tients increases, and the decisions of what to do or not do hinge not only on data but also diverse human values, the importance of understanding and monitoring how infants die increases in equal measure.

Here we review our experience of NIPD and introduce congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) as a model for NIPD of autosomal recessive (AR) disease. Materials and methodsAn audit of cases was carried out from our internal database for 2014. Agilent Sureselect Custom enrichment assay, targeted at heterozygous SNPs around CYP21A2 was designed. CffDNA was prepared using Kappa Hyper Prep Kit. Libraries were sequenced on the Illumina MiSeq and variants called using BWA and Varscan. Parental and proband samples were used to construct parental haplotype. Fetal inheritance was determined using the constructed haplotypes. ResultsIn 2014 203/337 (60%) molecular prenatal tests in our laboratory were non invasive. NIPD for fetal sex determination accounted for 73%, 14% were for achondroplasia, 13% thanatophoric dysplasia and around 0.5% for other monogenic disorders. Of those giving a definitive diagnosis in a mono genic condition 63/197 (32%) were NIPD. CAH analysis of two families to date has correctly identified fetally inherited alleles, consistent with either corresponding CVS sample or follow up data from the pregnancy. ConclusionsNon invasive referrals exceed invasive in our prenatal service. NIPD in our laboratory is considered diagnostic and confirmatory invasive testing is not recommended.

23021,"As part of the NIPSIGEN project (Non Invasive Prenatal diagnosis for Single Gene disorders), we are developing and validating a clinical test for NIPD of DMD/BMD in at risk pregnancies. Through highly targeted enrichment (200 Kb across a 2.4 Mb region on ChrX) and massively parallel sequencing (Illumina MiSeq) of cffDNA followed by relative haplotype dosage (RHDO) analysis, we were able to determine fetal inheritance of the dystrophin gene in six male pregnancies: four healthy pregnant donors and two pregnant DMD carriers all undergoing invasive prenatal testing. Fetal genomic DNA from CVS of healthy donors was used to identify the haplotype of interest on ChrX. For the DMD pregnancies, the affected haplotype was identified from genomic DNA from an affected sibling. Using RHDO analysis, the allelic imbalance in 300 400 heterozygous SNPs was used to determine over /un der representation of the reference haplotype in statistically independent haplotype blocks. For all healthy pregnancies, over representation of the expected fetal haplotype was observed for all haplotype blocks. Both DMD pregnancies were correctly diagnosed and a recombination event was de tected. The fetal portion of cfDNA inputted into the RHDO analysis was cal culated using the same allelic imbalance. This new assay for NIPD of DMD/BMD has shown great promise in the initial stages of validation with high sensitivity and specificity on samples tested so far. It is highly affordable (2 3 patients per sequencing run) and capable of detecting recombination events within the DMD gene by splitting the RHDO analysis into multiple statistically independent haplotype blocks across the targeted region.

However, a baseline false positive and false negative rate remains. We in troduced an analysis pipeline which addresses some of the technical and biologically derived causes of error. Importantly, it differentiates high z scores due to fetal trisomies from those due to local maternal CNVs causing false positives. Following routine clinical analysis of over 5000 prospective pregnancies, several other genomic imbalances were found in addition to detection of the common autosomal aneuploidies. These findings include (i) other (segmental) aneuploidies (0,3% of cases), 4 of which could be confir med to be fetal (1 mosaic trisomy 16 and 1 mosaic trisomy 15 which contai ned a uniparental disomy cell line, 2 partial trisomies 18 and 1 terminal 5p deletion) and (ii) maternal imbalances. Importantly, three aberrant genome representation profiles were observed that could not be attributed to the maternal nor the fetal genomic constitution. Whole body diffusion weighted magnetic resonance imaging and subsequent pathologic and genetic inve stigation uncovered the presence of respectively an ovarian carcinoma, a follicular lymphoma and a nodular sclerosis classical Hodgkin lymphoma.

Ethical aspects have not been a main focus of those statements. This ESHG/ASHG document fills this lacuna. Emerging scenarios for introducing NIPT into prenatal screening should not just be regarded as a matter of screening technology and health economics; the question is also how the trade offs involved enable or impede meaningful reproductive choices and how they affect the balance of benefits and burdens for pregnant women and their partners. With improving screening technologies and decreasing costs of sequencing and analysis, it will become technically possible to expand the scope of prenatal screening beyond common autosomal aneuploidies. This should be limited to serious congenital and childhood disorders, and only following sound validation studies and a comprehensive evaluation of all relevant aspects. In countries where prenatal screening for fetal abnormali ties is offered as a public health programme, governments and public health authorities should adopt a more active role to ensure the responsible inno vation of prenatal screening on the basis of ethical principles.

We report on the challenges involved in developing SCA for RNA NGS: workflow, experimental design, techniques, quality control, analysis, and interpretation. Materials and Methods: Utilizing FluidigmÃ¢ÂÂs C1Ã¢ÂÂ¢ system, we captured 4 cell populations. cDNA was QCd with capillary electrophoresis. 96 single cells were prepped for Illumina sequencing using a modified Nextera XT kit. Samples were sequenced on the HiSeq2500 Rapid (PE 100 base reads). Results: Integrated workflow between flow sorting and C1 capture required planning and a close relationship with the flow facility. Although cDNA, li brary preparation, and the sequencing run QC measurements passed, we had 14% failure (13/96 libraries). Data analysis (approximately 3 million reads/cell) demonstrates that accumulation of unique RNA species across multiple single cells yields coverage estimates for genomic expression, but that cell types can be differentiated. Conclusions: SCA has great potential, however, variance in expression of in dividual genes requires detailed consideration, and cluster analysis of single cells from multiple compartments should take mean variance relationships of individual genes into account. Analysis and experimental design require a mind shift from the averaging method to which we have been chained and there remains an inordinate amount of work to be done before single cell clinical diagnostics is possible.",2015
23025,"Inversions are known to be associated to phenotypic and functional diffe rences between individuals. Unfortunately, their study has lagged behind due to the technical difficulties of their analysis, especially when they are flanked by highly identical inverted repeats (IRs). Here, we present a new method called inverse MLPA (iMLPA, patent pending) to genotype simul taneously multiple inversions mediated by IRs in hundreds of individuals, which is based on a combination of inverse PCR and probe hybridization. In particular, current developed assays are able to genotype more than 30 in versions using only 25 ng of DNA per inversion, although it should be easy to include additional inversions as they are identified. To test the performance of the technique, we have genotyped 24 of these inversions in 550 individu als of seven diverse human populations from the 1000 Genomes Project with 98.5% genotyping success rate. In addition, by comparing with the results obtained by PCR for a subset of the samples, we have shown that iMLPA is highly accurate and most errors accumulate in specific inversions affected by restriction site polymorphisms. Finally, we have established the popula tion distribution and evolutionary history of the inversions, their functional effects on genes, and we have observed that most inversions with IRs are recurrent and are not linked to SNPs. Therefore, having a high throughput technique to genotype these inversions is crucial to shed light on their as sociation with complex phenotypes and disease susceptibilities, and could contribute to unravel the hidden heritability of the human genome.

Va riation in these repeats can alter the function and/or expression of genes al lowing organisms to swiftly adapt to novel environments. Importantly, some repeat expansions have also been linked to certain diseases. Unfortunately, due to the nature of short read sequencing technologies, tandem repeats are not analyzed during whole genome or exome sequencing studies. We deve loped a novel capture assay for large scale genotyping of tandem repeats (Duitama J., Zablotskaya A. et al., Nucl.

23027,"Sanger sequencing is THE standard to scan disease genes for deleterious variants. Although next generation sequencing is gradually taken over it will not resolve all issues. A major limitation of both methods is their short read length (~1,000 nucleotides), making it impossible to study certain rearran gements and/or resolve regions with repetitive sequences. We have applied long read single molecule sequencing (Pacific Biosciences) to overcome this limitation and tackle some of the remaining diagnostic problems. For targeted sequencing we apply a two step procedure: target amplifica tion with gene specific M13 tailed primers followed by barcoding using reusable M13 tailed barcode primers. Barcoded samples are then pooled and processed for smart bell sequencing. Sequencing runs yield ~60,000 sequences with ~15kb read lengths. Using this approach we have targeted several loci of interest. The CYP2D6 gene is amplified and sequenced as a 6.6kb fragment. Although homolo gous sequences may co amplify (e.g. the CYP2D7 gene) the full length se quences simply their discrimination and recognition of both CYP2D6 alleles. The latter is important to accurately predict the drug dose to use. In PKD1 long reads allow us to start in unique 3Ã¢ÂÂ sequences and read far into highly repetitive 5Ã¢ÂÂ sequences. In PMS2 they help to discriminate the active gene from several PMS2 pseudogenes. When genomic structure complicates am plification or compromises analysis, we use RNA to synthesize full length cDNA and perform long read sequencing. Finally, we use long read single molecule sequencing to resolve individual alleles from repeat expansion dis orders and to analyse complex disease associated repeat structures (D4Z4 in FSHD).

We show that WES performs comparable to WGS in terms of covered ba ses if sequenced at 2 3 times higher coverage.

De novo mutations are recognized both as an important source of human genetic variation and as a prominent cause of sporadic disease. Mutations identified as de novo are generally assumed to have occurred during game togenesis and, consequently, be present as germline events in an individual. However, Sanger sequencing does not provide the sensitivity to reliably di stinguish somatic from germline mutations. Therefore, the proportion of de novo mutations occurring somatically rather than in the germline remains unknown. To determine the contribution of post zygotic events to de novo mutations, we analysed a set of de novo mutations in 50 parent offspring trios using three sequencing techniques. We found that 8 out of 107 pre sumed germline de novo mutations (7.5%) were in fact present as mosaic mutations in the blood of the offspring and were therefore likely to have oc curred post zygotically. Furthermore, genome wide analysis of de novo va riants led to the identification of 5 de novo mutations in the offspring which were also detectable in the blood of one of the parents. This implies parental mosaicism as the origin of these de novo mutations in 5 out of 50 trios. Re markably, none of the parental low level mosaicisms detected by Whole Ge nome Sequencing and validated by amplicon based deep sequencing, were identified by Sanger sequencing. Our results show that a significant propor tion of de novo mutations presumed to be germline in fact occurred either post zygotically in the offspring or were inherited from low level mosaicism in one of the parents.",2015
23030,"Next generation sequencing studies have led to the identification of a large number of novel autosomal intellectual disability (ID) genes. However, the interpretation of disease causality of genetic variants on the X chromosome has remained behind and up to now has been mostly dependent on segrega tion analysis in families. We identified de novo frameshift, missense, nonsen se and splice site mutations in DDX3X in 15 females within cohorts of spora dic ID patients. These females showed mild to severe ID and various other features including cortical dysplasia, hypotonia, movement disorders, beha viour problems and epilepsy. In seeming contrast with these observations, we additionally identified three families with variants in DDX3X suggestive for a X linked recessive inheritance pattern, in which males had mild to se vere ID while carrier females were unaffected. Intriguingly, in silico predic tion and protein modelling programs could not discriminate between the de novo variants in affected females and the variants associated with X linked recessive inheritance. The gene DDX3X encodes a multifunctional RNA heli case and is particularly intolerant to genomic variation. To further explore the pathogenic mechanisms that might underlie the differences in disease transmission and phenotypic outcomes, we have employed a combination of in vitro and in vivo assays grounded on the known roles of DDX3X on the regulation of ÃÂ² catenin signaling. Preliminary studies indicate a dosage de pendent effect of DDX3X on Wnt signaling that is altered by the introduction of the majority of the missense changes found in our cohort.

De novo missense mu tations in two different subunits of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) were identified in 15 individuals with mild to severe ID, long lasting hypotonia, epileptic susceptibility, frontal bossing, mild hypertelorism and downslan ting palpebral fissures. The PP2A holoenzymes comprise catalytic (C), scaffolding (A) and regulato ry (B) subunits that determine subcellular anchoring, substrate specificity and physiological function. Nine patients had mutations (E198K, E200K, P201R or W207R) that brought a basic charge into a highly conserved acidic loop of the PPP2R5D encoded regulatory B56ÃÂ´ subunit, including six indivi duals who had the same de novo E198K mutation. Five others had de novo mutations (P179L, R182W and R258H, all also cancer associated) in the PPP2R1A encoded scaffolding AÃÂ± subunit. Large ventricles causing macro cephaly and suspicion of hydrocephalus were features in some cases, and all AÃÂ± cases had partial or complete corpus callosum agenesis. Functional studies showed that the mutant A and B subunits were stable and uncoupled from the C subunit: Mutant B56ÃÂ´ had deficient A and C subu nit binding, while mutant AÃÂ± had deficient binding of C, but not of B56ÃÂ´. This suggested that mutant B56ÃÂ´ or mutant AÃÂ± B56ÃÂ´ complexes could hinder C subunit access to B56ÃÂ´ anchored PP2A substrates. Such a dominant nega tive effect was supported by our finding of hyperphosphorylation of B56ÃÂ´ regulated substrates upon mutant subunit overexpression. This was also in line with clinical observation indicating a correlation between the degrees of ID and biochemical disturbance.",2015

To identify new causes of human overgrowth, we have been ABSTRACTS CONCURRENT SESSIONS ESHG 2015 | GLASGOW, SCOTLAND, UK | WWW. ESHG. ORG 21Back to inde x undertaking trio based exome sequencing studies in overgrowth patients and their unaffected parents. Prioritisation of functionally relevant genes with multiple unique de novo mutations revealed four mutations in three related genes encoding components of the protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), a key cellular serine threonine phosphatase. All four mutations clustered within a highly conserved functional domain of 27 nucleotides shared by all three genes. Analysis of exome sequencing data from a follow up cohort of overgrowth probands identified a further mutation in the cluster regi on, bringing the total number of patients with PP2A related mutations to five. Mutation carriers shared some similar phenotypic features including increased height, increased head circumference and intellectual disability. We mapped the mutations onto the crystal structure of the PP2A holoenzy me complex to predict their molecular and functional consequences. These studies suggest that the mutations may affect substrate binding, thus per turbing the ability of PP2A to dephosphorylate certain protein substrates. PP2A is a major negative regulator of V akt Murine Thyoma Viral Oncogene Homolog (AKT). Thus, our data further expands the list of genes encoding components of the PI3K/AKT signalling cascade that are disrupted in hu man overgrowth conditions.

Mutations in chromatin remodelling and histone modification genes are increasingly recognized as a major cause of intellectual disability (ID) and other frequently overlapping neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism. BCL11A has recently been shown to be a stable subunit of the BAF SWI/SNF complex in mammals. This evolutionary conserved complex is involved in transcriptional regulation through ATP dependent modification of chroma tin structure. The Deciphering Developmental Disorders Study (DDD) has identified de novo mutations in BCL11A (previously linked to autism spectrum disorder) as a cause of non syndromic intellectual disability. We present the clinical features of these patients, as well as model organism studies that support the role of Bcl11a in neurodevelopmental phenotypes. In mouse embryonic development, Bcl11a is expressed in the forebrain and derivatives of the first and second pharyngeal arches. It maintains high expression in the central nervous system and craniofacial mesenchyme throughout postnatal stages. The study of the haploinsufficient mouse mo del of Bcl11a shows abnormal brain development, with overall decreased brain size, particularly in regions of the limbic system. Behavioural pheno typing has identified impaired social behaviour in the haploinsufficient mice compared to littermate controls. Previously known for its role in lymphoid malignancies, BCL11A now joins the increasing number of genes involved in neurodevelopment through a putative role in chromatin remodelling.",2015
23034,"Background Ã¢ÂÂ Trio based exome sequencing in 100 patients with intellectu al disability (ID) previously identified a de novo mutation in WAC , encoding a protein regulating transcription coupled histone H2B ubiquitination. The WAC gene is located on chromosome 10p11.23 and has previously been im plicated in a microdeletion syndrome also containing BAMBI . Here, we used different strategies to identify additional patients with mutations in WAC to establish the role of WAC in ID. Methods We collected de novo mutations affecting WAC through routine diagnostic procedures including genomic microarray analysis and/or exo me sequencing, and supplemented these with mutations reported in (inter) national databases. Moreover, we performed targeted resequencing of WAC in 2,326 patients with unexplained ID. For patients with mutations, we per formed a detailed phenotypic comparison to the previously described phe notype for 10p12p11 microdeletion syndrome. Results Ã¢ÂÂ We identified four additional de novo loss of function mutations in WAC , including three point mutations and one partial deletion. Clinical re evaluation of our total cohort of five patients revealed phenotypic overlap for mild ID, hypotonia, behavioral problems and distinct overlapping facial dysmorphism, including a square shape of the face, deep set eyes, Kabuki like long palpebral fissures, broad mouth and broad chin. Notably, these cli nical features are comparable to the main features observed in 10p12p11 microdeletion syndrome. Conclusions Ã¢ÂÂWe defined a clinically recognizable ID syndrome, caused by de novo loss of function mutations in WAC , characterized by ID, hypotonia and distinctive facial features. In addition, our data suggest that haploinsuf fiency of WAC contributes to the phenotypic appearance of patients with the 10p12p11 microdeletion syndrome.",2015

Studies of genetic causes of intellectual disability and identification of mo nogenic causes of obesity in humans have made immense contributions to wards the understanding of the brain and control of body mass. Here we describe a novel disorder of global developmental delay, intellectual disa bility and susceptibility to obesity caused by 6q16 deletions encompassing POU3F2 (Brn2 or N Oct3 or OCT7) in nine patients from five families. The developmental delay and intellectual disability varied from mild to severe in our cohort. The body mass index (BMI) of all, but one patient, was above the 99th centile and in the obese category. BMI of one girl in our study was on the 91st centile putting her in overweight category. POU3F2 upregulates proneuronal genes, is required for production, migra tion and positioning of neocortical neurons, is an essential factor needed to generate induced neuronal cells in vitro and is required for hypothalamic development and function. Using zebrafish as model organism we show that pou3f2 lies downstream of sim1 in the leptin>melanocortin>Sim1 pathway and controls oxytocin expression in the hypothalamic neuroendocrine pre optic area. Our zebrafish work, previous work on mouse models and the human phenotypes demonstrate that the molecular pathway linking the ge nes in the central molecular pathway that regulates body mass is conserved across multiple species. This is further supported by our analysis of expres sion pattern of POU3F2 and related genes in human brain.

Smoking is a major preventable environmental risk factor related to human health. Smoking killed about 100 million people during the 20th century and is projected to kill one billion people during this century, assuming that the current frequency of smoking is retained. Lung cancer is the prime cause of cancer associated death in relation to smoking. However, it is less well appreciated that smoking also causes tumors outside the respiratory tract, which are predominant in men, and cumulatively roughly as common as lung cancer. Moreover, it is known that males have a higher incidence and mortality from most sex unspecific cancers, disregarding smoking status, and this fact is largely unexplained by known risk factors. We have shown that a male specific risk factor, acquired mosaic loss of chromosome Y (LOY) in non cancerous blood cells, is associated with an increased risk of non hematological tumors among aging males (Forsberg et al. 2014 Nature Genetics, PMID: 24777449). We have also recently shown that smoking is associated with LOY in blood cells in three independent cohorts (TwinGe ne: OR,4.3, 95% CI ,2.8 6.7; ULSAM: OR,2.4, 95% CI,1.6 3.6; and PIVUS: OR,3.5, 95% CI,1.4 8.4) encompassing in total 6014 men. Our data also support a transient and dose dependent mutagenic effect from smoking on LOY status (Dumanski et al. 2015 Science, PMID: 25477213). Thus, smoking may induce LOY, linking the most common acquired human mutation with a severe preventable risk factor. Our results could explain the observed sex differences and why smoking seems a greater risk factor for cancer in men than women.",2015
23037,"Aberrant regulation of the NF ÃÂºB pathway has been shown in breast cancer, however, the impact of the genetic variation in the pathway on patient pro gnosis has been little studied. Possibly, for a complex disease such as breast cancer a single SNP is not independently critical in the biological function un derlying the initiation or progression of the disease but multiple loci might jointly exert a greater impact. We used an extensive data set of the Breast Cancer Association Consortium (BCAC) with 30,431 cases to investigate the NF ÃÂºB activating pathway for association between 917 germline SNPs in 75 genes and breast cancer survival. Assessing two way SNP SNP interaction survival analyses, we found two pairs of genetic variations with interactive effect on breast cancer survival, i.e. rs5996080 and rs7973914 (HRinterac tion 6.98, 95% CI 3.3 14.4, P,1.42E 07), and rs17243893 and rs57890595 (HRinteraction 0.51, 95% CI 0.3 0.6, P,2.19E 05). Based on in silico functio nal analyses, we hypothesize that the rs5996080 and rs7973914 may affect the BAFFR and TNFR1/TNFR3 receptors and breast cancer survival possib ly by disturbing both the canonical and the non canonical NF ÃÂºB pathways or their dynamics, whereas rs17243893 and rs57890595 interaction on patient survival may be mediated through TRAF2 and TRAIL R4 interplay.

23038,"Understanding the genetic architecture of cancer requires genomic and integrative approaches. Cancers feature genomic alterations ranging from single base changes to large scale structural variation (SV) involving gains and losses, and rearrangements. Having a complete catalogue of mutati ons in cancer is crucial for identifying key drivers and providing accurate diagnosis, prognosis, and targeted therapy. Whole genome sequencing has become more routine and affordable since the introduction of next genera tion sequencing (NGS) technologies. However, NGS platforms have limited power to decipher large, complex structural variants frequently observed in cancer. Genome mapping represents a complementary technology that provides critical structural information. It involves high throughput analysis of single molecules spanning hundreds of kilobases in nanochannels. Long range information is preserved and direct interrogation of complex structu ral variants made possible. Here, we present our analysis of well studied and highly rearranged can cer genomes such as the near tetraploid HCC1143 cell line. We construc ted completely de novo genome map assemblies with N50 lengths of more than 1 Mb.

We observed that tumor samples had highly variable copy number profiles, correspon ding to focal and chromosome scale changes. We also present a pipeline to integrate NGS and genome mapping data to validate and refine translocati on calls. Genome mapping data helped bridge and phase neighboring trans location events.

Integrative bioinformatic analyses were employed to define molecular sub groups, which were then related to histology, molecular biomarkers, inclu ding IDH1/2 mutation, 1p/19q co deletion, TERT promoter mutation, and patient outcome. Genomic profiling identified five distinct glioma groups. Expression profiling revealed evidence for eight transcriptionally different tumor groups.

23040,"BACKGROUND: Mismatch repair (MMR) deficiency in tumor DNA causes shifts in the translational reading frame resulting in the production of alte red peptides. Frame shift peptides (FSP), such as Caspase 5 and TGF bRII, are considered Ã¢ÂÂforeignÃ¢ÂÂ by the immune system. Dendritic cells are (DC) the professional antigen presenting cells of the immune system and decisive in inducing immunity. This is the rationale for vaccination with monocyte derived DC (moDC) loaded with FSPs to stimulate T cells to combat Lynch syndrome associated tumors. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Lynch syndrome CRC patients (n,3) and healthy mutation carriers (n,20) were vaccinated with DC loaded with CEA and FSP MHC class I binding peptides. After each vaccination round (up to 3), anti gen specific CD8+ T cells were assessed in blood and challenged skin. Injec tion of minute amounts of the DC vaccine resulted in infiltration of immune cells into the skin. Specificity of these lymphocytes was assessed by flow cytometry with tetrameric MHC complexes binding to T cells that recognize the indicated peptides. RESULTS: In most patients, after moDC vaccinations, both FSP and CEA specific CD8+ T cells were present. Additionally CD8+ T cells specific for Caspase 5 and CEA were detectable. The functionality of skin infiltrating T cells was demonstrated by their production of IFN g upon stimulation with target cells loaded with CEA or one of the FSPs. CONCLUSIONS: DC vaccination against CEA and FSP antigens appears fea sible and immune responses towards Lynch syndrome tumor specific pepti des are induced. Our data emphasize DC vaccination can enhance the hostÃ¢ÂÂs antitumor immunity and underline consideration for cancer prevention in Lynch syndrome.",2015

Prolonged QRS is associated with increased risk of sudden cardiac death and heart failure. In previous work, we have identified common variants in loci associated with QRS interval du ration comprising non coding regions of the genome. We hypothesized that genes influencing this trait may harbour both common and rare variants in protein coding regions. Methods: The Illumina HumanExome Beadchip (Ex Chip) is an array focused on rare and low frequency putative functional coding variation. We conduc ted an Ex Chip meta analysis for QRS interval duration in 62,251 partici pants from 17 studies collaborating in the CHARGE Ex Chip EKG Consorti um.

Nonsyndromic mitral valve prolapse (MVP) is a common (2 4%) degenerative valvulopathy, a risk factor for cardiac failure and the most frequent indication for surgical repair of mitral regurgitation. We per formed a genome wide association study to identify risk loci, which may uncover novel pathogenic mechanisms. Methods. We tested 4.8 million common genotyped/imputed variants in 1412 MVP cases and 2439 controls. Replication for 23 loci was performed in 4 case control studies (Ncases,1442, NControls,6779). Candidate genes were investigated for protein expression by immunohistochemistry on val ves in embryonic and adult mice and morpholino knockdown (KD) assessed cardiac function in zebrafish. Results. Six susceptibility loci were identified after replication (P<5ÃÂ10 8). Association was observed in LMCD1 (OR,1.32, P ,1.3ÃÂ10 11), a repressor of GATA6 previously implicated in cardiac hypertrophy. KD of Lmcd1 in ze brafish induced significant atrioventricular (AV) valve defect with regurgita tion.

Mutations in several genes controlling early leftÃ¢ÂÂright patterning have been implicated in heterotaxy but account for a minority of cases. We performed whole exome or genome sequencing in 2 families with re currence of complex CHDs associated with laterality defects of abdominal organs. We identified compound heterozygous mutations (stop and mis sense or frameshift and exonic deletion) in matrix metallopeptidase 21 (MMP21 ) in both families. MMP family members are involved in extra cel lular matrix turnover. Interestingly, mice homozygous for ENU induced mis sense mutations in Mmp21 exhibit CHDs and heterotaxy. Also, we performed knockdown of mmp21 in zebrafish using an antisense morpholino, which resulted in abnormal cardiac looping, a consequence of disrupted left right patterning. We then performed next generation sequencing of MMP21 in a cohort of 168 index cases with CHDs and heterotaxy. From this cohort we identified 9 families with one or more affected siblings exhibiting variati ons in MMP21 on both alleles, including a homozygous missense affecting the start codon in one family and a homozygous frameshift in another. The frequency of MMP21 associated heterotaxy in this cohort is therefore po tentially as high as 6%, pending the validation of all missense mutations in functional assays in zebrafish.

These patients are characterized by small multifocal lesions, which may increase in number with time. We explained this by KnudsonÃ¢ÂÂs double hit theory and demonstrated somatic second hits (intragenic or chromosomal anomalies, including acquired uniparental isodisomy) in all three entities. The frequency of somatic 2nd hits made us study sporadic patients for so matic changes. We screened resected tissues from >100 venous (VM), >70 lymphatic (LM) and >30 capillary (CM) malformations for mutations in can didate genes, either by RT PCR or Ion Torrent PGM, for high sensitivity. We frequently pinpointed somatic activating mutations: in +/ 50% of VMs in TIE2, 80% of LMs in PIK3CA, 50% of CMs in GNAQ, and in some syndromic forms, like CLOVES syndrome, in PIK3CA. Interestingly, sporadic patients with multifocal VMs were mosaic in blood with a somatic second hit in tis sues, whereas in Blue Rubber Bleb Nevus syndrome, somatic cis mutations in distant lesions were shared, without blood mosaicism. We conclude that somatic mutations are a common pathophysiologic cau se of sporadic vascular anomalies. Wider mosaicism is evident in sporadic patients with multifocal lesions.

23047,"Introduction: Two problems for molecular diagnosis of neurogenetic disor ders are high levels of genetic heterogeneity and involvement of large genes, e.g. titin. Materials and Methods: To offset these problems we developed a TargetSeq (Life Technologies) capture panel containing 277 genes in which mutations detectable by next generation sequencing (NGS) cause neurogenetic di seases. The diseases range from foetal akinesia, through muscular dystro phies and peripheral neuropathies, to motor neuron disease. The targeted genes were captured from pooled bar coded patient DNA samples. Up to 24 patient samples were sequenced at a time using Ion ProtonÃ¢ÂÂ¢ (Life Techno logies) sequencing. Variant analysis was by either custom Annovar or Carta genia (Cartagenia, Inc.) based pipelines. Results: Testing the panel identified 88% of the known small scale mutati ons in 28 positive controls. Known mutations deliberately chosen in regions not sequenced well by NGS were not detected. Using FishingCNV, we iden tified 90% of CNV controls, including 100% of CMT1A/HNPP duplication/deletion controls. Although one single exon CNV was detected, not all small CNVs were detected. We have screened approaching 600 molecularly undia gnosed probands, whose clinical diagnosis matched the diseases screened by the panel. We identified mutations in 68 genes, 40 of which were not previously analysed at all by the diagnostic laboratory due to Sanger se quencing costs. The overall success rate (Class 5 and 4 variants) was 34%, varying from 20% in distal arthrogryposis and SMA/MND, to 57% in chan nelopathies.

23048,"Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD) predominantly affects the muscles in the face, trunk and upper extremities. FSHD is associated with partial chromatin relaxation of the D4Z4 macrosatellite repeat array localized on chromosome 4 and transcriptional derepression of the D4Z4 encoded DUX4 gene in skeletal muscle. In the most common form, FSHD1, this D4Z4 chromatin relaxation is caused by a D4Z4 repeat array contraction to 1 10 units (normal range 10 100 units). In the rare form of FSHD, FSHD2, D4Z4 chromatin relaxation occurs without repeat contraction, and is most often caused by loss of function mutations in the structural maintenance of chromosomes hinge domain containing 1 (SMCHD1 ) gene. SMCHD1 is in volved in the maintenance of D4Z4 methylation and a repressed chromatin structure. An SMCHD1 mutation screen in a large cohort of FSHD2 individuals revealed a mutation spectrum that ranges from large deletions causing SMCHD1 he mizygosity, to missense, nonsense and splice site mutations. In addition to the autosomal dominant inheritance seen in most FSHD2 families, we also identified a family with semidominant inheritance. Furthermore, SMCHD1 mutations can also modify disease severity in FSHD1.This mutation spectrum shows that epigenetic sensitivity to disease pre sentation depends on the nature of SMCHD1 mutation in combination with D4Z4 array size with SMCHD1 open reading frame preserving mutations being more deleterious for the maintenance of repressive D4Z4 chromatin state, than open reading frame disrupting mutations. Collectively, our study positions SMCHD1 central in the FSHD2 and FSHD1 disease mechanisms and warrants further studies into SMCHD1 as therapeutic target.

23049,"Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a devastating motoneuron disorder caused by functional loss of SMN1. Previously, we identified Plastin 3 (PLS3) as a strong candidate protective modifier using transcriptome differential expression analysis in SMA discordant families. PLS3 was highly upregulated in lymphoblastoid cell lines of asymptoma tic but not SMA siblings at both, RNA and protein level. Instead fibroblast cell lines from both SMA and asymptomatic siblings showed similar PLS3 expression, suggesting a tissue specific regulation. To investigate whether PLS3 is upregulated in motorneurons, the primary affected cells in SMA, we generated induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from fibroblasts of three asymptomatic and three SMA III affected siblings. After full characterization of pluripotency, small molecule neural precursor cells (smNPCs) were gene rated from iPSCs. Next, motoneurons were differentiated from smNPCs and characterized for any possible changes including survival, gem counts, pro tein and RNA expression of SMN and PLS3. Most strikingly, PLS3 was highly upregulated only in motoneurons from asymptomatic siblings pinpointing a tissue specific regulation. To finally address the PLS3 rescuing effect in SMA disorder, we generated PLS3 overexpressing mice, which were crossed into a severe SMA mouse model. By applying low amounts of exon 7 inclusion SMN antisense oligonu cleotides (ASOs), we improved the multi organ dysfunction in these severe SMA mice and increased their survival from 14 to 28 days. Most importantly, crossing the PLS3 transgene homozygously into these mice led to a robust increase of survival (>60% survived >180 days). These combined data pro vide strong evidence for PLS3 as protecting modifier in humans and SMA mouse model.",2015

23051,"i P . La Fe, Valencia, Spain. Charcot Marie Tooth (CMT) disease is a hereditary sensory and motor neuropathy with more than 60 genes associated. CMT type 2K (CMT2K) is caused by mutations in the GDAP1 gene and is characterized by incomplete penetrance and intrafamilial clinical variability. We have recently described the junctophilin1 (JPH1) as a genetic modifier of GDAP1. We characterized the combination of the JPH1 p. R213P and the GDAP1 p. R120W mutation in one patient with a more severe clinical picture. Through cellular studies we established that the combination of these two mutations significant in creases the basal cytosolic Ca2+ and reduces SOCE activity, and therefore, JPH1 contribute to the phenotypical consequences of GDAP1 mutations. Junctophilin genes are characterized by having a long 3Ã¢ÂÂUTR (from 1861 nt of JP in Drosophila melanogaster to 2347 nt of JPH1 in humans) and that is conserved in the case of JPH1.

Ho mozygosity mapping identified a single disease associated locus of 3.5Mb on chromosome 3. Studies of a Bedouin consanguineous kindred with 4 individuals affected with a similar recessive phenotype identified a single disease associated 18Mb homozygosity locus containing the entire 3.5Mb locus of the Ethiopian family. Whole exome sequencing demonstrated one homozygous mutation in CCDC174 (c.1404A>G, p.[*468Trpext*6]) within a shared identical haplotype of 0.6Mb, common to both Bedouin and Ethiopi an affected individuals, suggesting an ancient common founder effect. The mutation segregated as expected in both kindreds and was not found in 400 Bedouin and 100 Jewish Ethiopian controls. Knockdown of the CCDC174 ortholog in Xenopus laevis embryos resulted in poor neural fold closure at the neurula stage with later embryonic lethality. Knockdown embryos ex hibited a sharp reduction in expression of n tubulin, a marker for differen tiating primary neurons, and of hindbrain markers krox20 and hoxb. The Xenopus phenotype could be rescued by the human normal, yet not the mu tant CCDC174 transcripts.

In one third of such cases, children with maternal UPD(16) manifest IUGR (attributed to trisomic placenta) and multiple con genital malformations, including heart defects, pulmonary hypoplasia, tra cheosophageal fistula, gut malrotation, absent gall bladder, renal agenesis, hydronephrosis, imperforate anus, and single umbilical artery. In contrast, relatively normal phenotype was reported in few patients with paternal UPD(16), and imprinted gene(s) on chromosome 16 were suggested as causative for maternal UPD(16) phenotype. All the above clinical features, except IUGR, are observed in the vast majority of children with a neona tally lethal lung developmental disorder Alveolar Capillary Dysplasia with Misalignment of Pulmonary Veins (ACDMPV). ACDMPV is caused by hetero zygous point mutations or genomic deletions involving FOXF1 on 16q24.1, previously shown to be paternally imprinted, incompletely and in a tissue specific manner. Most recently, genomic duplications involving FOXF1 were associated with pyloric stenosis, mesenterium commune, and aplasia of the appendix [PMID: 25472632]. We knocked in a Cre inducible Foxf1 allele at the ROSA26 locus and activated it with Tie2 cre to specifically overexpress Foxf1 in endothelial and hematopoietic cells. Using timed matings, microCT , and plethysmography analyses, we found that these mice exhibit hypopla stic lungs, abnormal breathing, gastrointestinal abnormalities, edema, skin hemorrhages, and die perinatally. We propose that Foxf1 overexpression in mice corroborates the clinical observations seen in patients with maternal UPD(16) and conclude that paternal imprinting of FOXF1 may be responsib le for the key phenotypic features of maternal UPD(16).",2015

Here, we report the clinical results of a NGS based preconception carrier genetic test (CGT) for mendelian conditions. Materials and Methods: Massive sequencing of 548 autosomal recessive (AR) and X linked genes involved in severe childhood phenotypes reinforced with 5 non NGS complementary tests, performed in ART patients. In case of ga mete donation, paired results (donor/patient) were blindly matched using a proprietary software. Results: We performed a total of 2,559 CGT analysis: 1,158 tests for gamete donors; 1,127 tests for patients using donation, and 274 CGT for 137 coup les undergoing ART with their own gametes. Positive results for at least one pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants were present in 92.5% samples (2,368). The average carrier burden per sample was 2.94 mutations and 14.39 variants of unknown significance. Female donors were discarded in case of pathogenic variant was found in an X linked gene. In our series 1.5% resulted positive (8 premutated in FMR1 gene and 5 for other X linked con ditions). Twelve couples using their own gametes (8.7%) were positive for pathogenic mutations, 8 for AR genes and 4 X linked genes. These couples received genetic counseling and PGD or gamete change was recommended.

23056,"Determination of variant pathogenicity represents a major challenge in the era of high throughput sequencing. Erroneous categorization may result if variants affect genes which are in fact dispensable. We demonstrate that this also applies to rare, apparently unambiguous truncating mutations of an established disease gene. By whole exome sequencing (WES) in a consan guineous family with congenital non syndromic deafness, we unexpectedly identified a homozygous nonsense variant, p. Arg1066*, in AHI1 , a gene as sociated with Joubert syndrome (JBTS), a severe recessive ciliopathy. None of four homozygotes expressed any signs of JBTS, and one of them had nor mal hearing, which also ruled out p. Arg1066* as the cause of deafness. Ho mozygosity mapping and WES in the only other reported JBTS family with a homozygous C terminal truncation (p. Trp1088Leufs*16) confirmed AHI1 as disease gene, but based on a more N terminal missense mutation impairing WD40 repeat formation. Morpholinos against N terminal zebrafish Ahi1 , orthologous to where human mutations cluster, produced a ciliopathy, but targeting near human p. Arg1066 and p. Trp1088 did not. Most AHI1 mutati ons in JBTS patients result in truncated protein lacking WD40 repeats and the SH3 domain; disease was hitherto attributed to loss of these protein interaction modules. Our findings indicate that normal development does not require the C terminal SH3 domain. This has far reaching implications, considering that variants like p. Glu984* identified by preconception scree ning (Ã¢ÂÂKingsmore panelÃ¢ÂÂ) do not necessarily indicate JBTS carriership.

However, recent advances in genetic technology have enabled a more comprehensive coverage of both disorders and pathogenic variants at little additional cost.

Notably, when discussing severity of the disease, some geneticists considered the impact of the disease on the family as a whole, suggesting screening should also be performed for severe conditions with effective yet burdensome therapeutic interventions. There was disagreement on the in clusion of adult onset and X linked disorders, with some geneticists favoring screening under certain conditions, while others supported active exclusion of such disorders.

23058,"Introduction: Obesity is a serious risk factor for cardiovascular and metabo lic disease. Considering the steady increase in obesity prevalence and that GWAS variants explain <5% of body mass index variance, gene environment interactions may contribute to obesity. We hypothesized that expression profiles in adipose tissue may reflect the molecular consequences of envi ronmental changes underlying obesity. Accordingly, in an obese cellular en vironment, context specific expression quantitative trait loci (cseQTL) vari ants might regulate gene expression distinctly from non obese conditions. Materials and Methods: We performed eQTL mapping (FDR<1%) using 7,932,277 SNPs with adipose RNA sequence data on 17,210 expressed ge nes in 582 men from the Finnish METSIM cohort. We considered the eQTLs only observed in the obese group, but not in the non obese or overall groups as obese eQTLs (OB), and vice versa for non obese (NOB). We tested the OB and NOB eQTL genes for replication in an independent METSIM cohort (n,771) using microarray data (FDR<5%).Results: We discovered 2,450 OB eQTL genes regulated by 28,267 cis (+/ 1Mb) variants; and 1,455 NOB eQTL genes regulated by 10,814 vari ants, respectively. Of these 55% of the OB and 41% of the NOB genes were consistent across RNA seq and microarrays in independent cohorts. When searching for potential drivers of context specificity, we observed that estrogen signaling genes were enriched among OB versus NOB eQTL genes (P,0.001), including HSD17B12, which converts estrone into the most acti ve estrogen, estradiol.

23059,"The expression of nearly all genes is subject to genetic regulation. This is a first conclusion from the largest population based RNA sequencing project executed so far, including 4,000 total blood mRNA samples from five Dutch biobanks. The large sample size, unprecedented resolution of this study and the comparison with other large population based studies revealed that SNPs affecting expression (eQTLs) act in a context dependent manner. Whereas microarray identified blood eQTLs (Westra et al., Nature Genetics, 2013) replicated well in our study (87%, including 6.8% with opposite al lelic direction), eQTLs identified by RNA seq in lymphocyte cell lines (LCL) (Lappalainen et al., Nature, 2013) replicated less well (78%, including 12% with opposite allelic direction). This wasnÃ¢ÂÂt due to differences in data pro cessing as we analyzed all RNA sequencing data with a common pipeline, but was partly due to differences in cell types. We inferred cell type specific eQTLs, and observed that lymphocyte specific eQTLs replicated well in LCL, but neutrophil specific eQTLs didnÃ¢ÂÂt. We also observed that higher order effects (e.g. differences in proliferation, differentiation or metabolism) can induce, abrogate or inverse eQTLs. We observed several examples where genetic risk factors affect gene expression only in a specific context. We con clude that the effect of SNPs on gene expression depends on the cell and the cellular state. Since eQTL data is not available for every tissue, cell or cellular state (and their specific combinations), predictions of the effect of genetic variation on gene expression should be carefully interpreted.

23060,"Genome wide association studies (GWAS) have successfully identified thou sands of loci for a range of human complex traits and diseases but explain only a limited proportion of trait variation. Mixed linear model analyses cap ture a greater proportion of phenotypic variance than GWAS single SNP ana lyses and provide insight into the genetic and environmental architecture of traits. Using this approach we analysed 18 traits related to metabolic syn drome in a Scottish cohort of ~14,000 individuals genotyped for ~550,000 common autosomal SNPs. Trait variation was partitioned into genetic ef fects associated with SNPs, genetic effects associated with pedigree, shared family environment, shared couple environment and shared full sibling environment. On average across traits SNP associated and pedigree asso ciated genetic effects each explained around half the genetic variance with recently shared environment of couples accounting for ~10% of the pheno typic variance on average, all of the three being important sources of variati on in metabolic syndrome traits. On the other hand, the environment shared largely in the past by members of a nuclear family or by full siblings, had a limited impact on trait variation. Our findings point to appropriate models to use in future studies as pedigree associated genetic effects and couple en vironmental effects have seldom been taken into account in genotype based analyses. In samples of unrelated individuals pedigree associated effects cannot be captured, explaining at least part of the missing heritability, but even in such studies it may be necessary to account for unrelated couples included in the sample to appropriately model the variation and hence make accurate predictions and inferences.",2015

For 15 loci the lead SNP was low frequency, for 8 a coding variant and 22 involved transcription factor binding sites. We showed that two loci, known for Mendelian amino acid metabolism disease with severe neurological ma nifestations, also harbor low frequency variants affecting the same circu lating amino acid in healthy population samples. Moreover, we show new evidence that the biosynthesis of lipoprotein(a) (Lp(a)), a known coronary heart disease (CHD) biomarker, is associated with very low density lipo protein metabolism and other lipoprotein particles. Causality of metabolite associations was shown with a genetic risk score (GRS Lp(a)) for Lp(a), which composed of 18 SNPs independently associated with circulating Lp(a) le vels at genome wide significance in a discovery cohort.

23062,"Genetic risk factors identified in genome wide association studies are mostly non coding, making it difficult to understand their functional consequences. So far, large scale trans eQTL analyses have identified such downstream functional consequences for only 233 SNPs (Westra et al, NG 2013). To in crease this, we used methylation QTL mapping in peripheral blood of 4,000 population based samples from the Dutch BBMRI NL BIOS consortium. We observed that 1,300 different GWAS SNPs affect methylation of over 10.000 unique CpGs sites in trans (FDR <0.05), representing a six fold increase in the number of disease associated SNPs for which downstream functional effects can be detected. To address the question in what particular biological processes these spe cific CpGs are involved, we also generated RNA sequencing data for 2,000 of the samples, permitting us to empirically relate CpG methylation to gene expression effects (eQTMs) for over 18,500 CpG sites (FDR <0.05). By using different genomic annotations we could accurately predict (AUC , 0.8) wh ether these methylation gene expression relationships were positive (35%) or negative (65%).By finally integrating the trans meQTLs and eQTMs and adapting pathway enrichment method DEPICT , we obtained insights in the downstream func tional effects of many genetic risk factors: rs3774959 (mapping close to NFKB1 and associated with ulcerative colitis) significantly affects methyla tion levels of 355 different CpG sites, of which many map within genes of the NF kappaB cascade.

The microbiome composi tion was accessed by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. The genotypes of 157 SNPs previously associated to lipid levels were available for all subjects. We deve loped the 2 part analysis model to account for both binary and qualitative features of microbiome.

Germline mutations in the succinate dehydrogenase subunit genes SDHB, SDHC and SDHD are the most frequent causes of inherited phaeochromocy tomas and paragangliomas. Since these genes were identified over a decade ago, genetic testing for mutations in them has become a standard clinical tool for many patients with these, and other, tumour types. However, the lack of information regarding penetrance and phenotypic variability asso ciated with SDHB/C/D mutations hinders optimum clinical management of individuals who are found to have a germline mutation. In order to address these issues we undertook a retrospective survey of 800 individuals (in cluding 401 previously reported) with identified mutations in SDHB/C/D. Analysis of age related tumour risks according to relevant gene and mutati on type (for SDHB and SDHD) provided novel estimates of penetrance and genotype phenotype correlations. In silico structural prediction analyses were performed to evaluate the functional effects of SDHB and SDHD muta tions. Increased knowledge of the molecular basis of phenotypic variability commonly observed in individuals with germline SDHB/C/D mutations will facilitate the development of personalised management protocols based on gene and mutation specific tumour risks. We describe the distinct phenotypes of SDHB Ile127Ser and SDHD Pro81 Leu carriers, which can be explained using structural prediction studies and may indicate a need to move towards mutation specific management plans for these patients.",2015
23069,"Hamartomatous polyposis syndromes (HPS) represent a small but ap preciable number of the gastrointestinal inherited cancer predisposition syndromes associated with a substantial risk for developing colonic and extracolonic malignancies. We present a unique case of familial juvenile polyposis syndrome associated with gastrointestinal ganglioneuromas of unknown etiology. The patient underwent genetic testing for the known HPS genes (BMPR1A, SMAD4, ENG, PTEN, STK11) but no mutation was de tected. Exome sequencing identified a novel germline mutation in SMAD9 resulting in reduced PTEN expression. We subsequently screened 40 JPS pa tients and 40 CS patients with HPS for SMAD9 mutations but did not detect any with SMAD9 mutations. Our patient, in addition to HPS, had significant ganglioneuromatosis which is rare but is overrepresented in CS patients with germline PTEN mutations. Our functional experiments show that our patientÃ¢ÂÂs SMAD9 mutation results in gain of function in SMAD8 leading to reduced PTEN mRNA and protein stability, together, yielding a phenotype (ganglioneuromatous polyps) seen more commonly in patients with germli ne PTEN mutations. Our study suggests that this may be indirectly regulated by miR21expression. We recommend that all patients with a clinical presen tation of hamartomatous polyposis especially those with gastrointestinal ganglioneuromas be referred for genetics evaluation.

23070,"JohnÃ¢ÂÂs, NL, Canada. Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is genetically heterogeneous, with evi dence for hundreds of susceptibility loci. Previous microarray and exome sequencing studies have examined portions of the genome in simplex fami lies (parents and one ASD affected child) having presumed sporadic forms of the disorder. We used whole genome sequencing (WGS) of 85 quartet families (parents and two ASD affected siblings), consisting of 170 indivi duals with ASD, to generate a comprehensive data resource encompassing all classes of genetic variation (including noncoding variants) and accom panying phenotypes, in apparently familial forms of ASD. By examining de novo and rare inherited single nucleotide and structural variations in genes previously reported to be associated with ASD or other neurodevelopmental disorders, we found that more than two thirds of the affected siblings car ried different ASD relevant mutations. These siblings with discordant muta tions tended to demonstrate more clinical variability than those who shared a risk variant. Our study emphasizes that substantial genetic heterogeneity exists in ASD, necessitating the use of WGS to delineate all genic and non genic susceptibility variants in research and in clinical diagnostics. We have now sequenced 200 additional ASD families using WGS. We will present our complete data analysis as well as additional progress from this study.",2015
23071,"Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disease caused by an interaction between genetic vulnerability and environmental factors. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have emerged as key post transcriptional regulators and are involved in multiple aspects of brain development and connectivity. Here, using olfactory mucosal stem cells biopsied from living patients, we identified a signature of four miRNAs (miR 146a, miR 221, miR 654 5p and miR 656) commonly deregulated in ASD. This signature is conserved in pri mary skin fibroblasts and allows discriminating between ASD and intellec tual disability samples. Putative target genes of the differentially expressed miRNAs were enriched for pathways previously associated to ASD and alte red levels of neuronal transcripts targeted by miR 146a, miR 221 and miR 656 were observed in patientsÃ¢ÂÂ cells. In the mouse brain, miR 146a displays strong neuronal expression in regions important for high cognitive func tions, and we demonstrate that overexpressing miR 146a leads to alteration of neuronal dendritic arborisation. These findings have strong diagnostic implications and emphasize the role of miRNA expression deregulation in the etiology of ASD, opening new opportunities for therapeutic approaches.",2015
23072,"Purpose: Mutations in GABAA receptor (GABAA R) subunit genes have been described in a range of epilepsy syndromes. Here, we tested whether muta tions in 18 genes encoding for GABAA receptor subunit genes contribute to the etiology of Rolandic epilepsy (RE) or its atypical variants (ARE). Methods: We performed exome sequencing in 204 European patients with RE/ARE and compared the frequency of GABAA R genes variants with 728 platform matched controls. We functionally assessed nonsynonymous GABRG2 variants for protein stability, trafficking, postsynaptic clustering and receptor function. Results: Out of 18 screened GABA A R genes, we found a significant en richment of rare variants in the GABRG2 gene in RE/ARE patients (5/204, 2.45%) when compared to controls (1/723, 0.14%) (OR , 18.07, 95% CI , 2.01 Ã¢ÂÂ 855.07, p , 0.0024, p corr , 0.043). We detected a splice variant (c.549 3T>G) in two unrelated patients as well as three nonsynonymous GABRG2 variations (p. G257R, p. R323Q, p. I389V). Functional analysis of the nonsyn onymous variants showed reduced surface expression of p. G257R and de creased GABA evoked currents for p. R323Q. The p. G257R mutation resul ted in reduced palmitoylation, a posttranslational modification crucial for trafficking of proteins to the cell membrane. Enzymatically enhanced pal mitoylation levels restored the surface expression of the p. G257R variant ÃÂ³2 subunit. Conclusion: The presented statistical association and functional evidence suggest that mutations in the GABRG2 gene increase risk of RE/ARE. Re storing the impaired membrane trafficking of some GABRG2 mutations by augmenting palmitoylation levels offers a therapeutic perspective to reverse the pathogenic effect of such mutants.

23074,"CADASIL is a disabling hereditary vascular dementia and stroke syndrome, occurring worldwide in ~1:50.000 individuals, for which no treatment is available. The disease is caused by stereotyped mutations in NOTCH3, which alter the number of cysteines in one of the epidermal growth factor like repeat (EGFr) domains of the NOTCH3 protein. This causes toxic NOTCH3 aggregation and accumulation in the (cerebro)vasculature, leading to vascu lar smooth muscle cell degeneration and a reduced cerebral blood flow. We hypothesized that re establishing the correct number of 6 cysteines within EGFr may prevent or reduce toxic NOTCH3 aggregation. To accomplish this NOTCH3 Ã¢ÂÂcysteine correctionÃ¢ÂÂ, we use antisense mediated exon skipping. Based on extensive in silico protein predictions, at least 12 NOTCH3 exons are eligible for this approach, targeting the majority of CADASIL causing mutations. We now have established that this targeted NOTCH3 exon skip ping is feasible both in a CADASIL patient derived cell model and in human NOTCH3 transgenic mice. Using Ã¢ÂÂskipÃ¢ÂÂ cDNA constructs, we show that the modified NOTCH3 proteins are expressed at the cell surface and bind to their canonical ligand Jagged1. This indicates that this selected exon exclusi on does not abrogate normal NOTCH3 processing and function. The human NOTCH3 transgenic mice which we generated for in vivo studies show pro gressive cerebrovascular NOTCH3 accumulation, and are therefore a good model to test potential therapies aimed at preventing or reducing NOTCH3 accumulation. Ongoing studies focus on optimizing in vivo exon skipping, to determine the effect of cysteine correction on vascular NOTCH3 accumulati on and ultimately the CADASIL phenotype.",2015
23075,"We hypothesized that de novo variants (DNV) might participate in the ge netic determinism of sporadic early onset Alzheimer disease (EOAD, onset before 65 years). We investigated first by array CGH and then by whole exome sequencing 14 sporadic EOAD trios. Two patients carried a de novo copy number variation and 7, among the remaining 12, had at least one non synonymous DNV. Five of these 9 DNV (an APP duplication, a BACE2 intronic deletion, and three nucleotide variants affecting PSEN1, VPS35 and MARK4) targeted a biological network centered on the Amyloid beta (AÃÂ²) peptide. Using appropriate statistical analyses, we showed that this a priori defined genetic network was significantly enriched in amino acid altering DNV, compared to the rest of the exome. In addition, we provided evidence of the functional impact of 4/5 DNV targeting this network: the causality of the APP de novo duplication (which is the first reported one) was obvious; the novel PSEN1 variant resulted in exon 9 skipping in patientÃ¢ÂÂs RNA, lea ding to a pathogenic missense at exons 8 10 junction; the VPS35 missense variant led to partial loss of retromer function, which may impact neuronal APP trafficking and AÃÂ² secretion; and the MARK4 multiple nucleotide vari ant resulted into increased Tau phosphorylation which may trigger enhan ced AÃÂ² induced toxicity. Despite the difficulty to recruit AD trios due to age structures of the pedigrees and the genetic heterogeneity of the disease, this strategy allowed us to highlight the role of de novo pathogenic events, the putative involvement of three new genes in AD genetics and the key role of AÃÂ² network alteration in AD.",2015

Known disease causing genes currently explain approximately 80% of the cases. We have recently identified mutations in components of the cytoplasmic dynein 2 complex, including the heavy chain and 2 novel inter mediate chains, but not any light chains. Objectives, methods and results: To define the underlying genetic and molecular basis, we have genetically explored a cohort of over 300 indi viduals using diverse DNA sequencing techniques including whole exome sequencing, identifying 3 families with loss of function (Ã¢ÂÂnullÃ¢ÂÂ) mutations in TCTEX1D2 , a new cytoplasmic dynein 2 (IFT dynein) light chain. We observed an unusual inheritance pattern suggesting incomplete penetran ce and in patient cells and Chlamydomonas , impairment of retrograde IFT seems milder than in models for other dynein 2 defects and in human, fish and Chlamydomonas and loss of TCTEX1D2 conferred no apparent changes in gross ciliary structure. Our proteomics analysis in Chlamydomonas and human proteomic analysis confirmed that TCTEX1D2/Tctex2b represents a component of an intermediate chain/light chain sub complex within IFT dynein and that in Chlamydomonas , the retrograde IFT defect observed is caused by instability of the entire IFT dynein complex. Conclusion: Together, our results suggest TCTEX1D2 is an integral compo nent of the IFT dynein complex in human, zebrafish and that loss of function mutations cause JATD, however its loss may be compensated for under cer tain conditions.",2015
23077,"Robinow Syndrome (RS) is a phenotypically and genetically heterogeneous condition that can be caused by mutations in genes encoding components of the non canonical WNT signaling pathway. In contrast, germline mutations that act to increase canonical WNT signaling lead to distinctive osteosclero tic phenotypes. Here we identify de novo frameshift mutations in DVL1, a mediator of both canonical and non canonical WNT signaling, as the cause of a subtype of RS with osteosclerosis (RS OS) in three unrelated individu als. The mutations all delete the DVL1 C terminus and replace it, in each in stance, with a novel, highly basic sequence. We show the presence of mutant transcript in fibroblasts from one individual with RS OS, and demonstrate unimpaired protein stability with transfected GFP tagged constructs bearing a frameshift mutation. In vitro TOPFlash assays, in apparent contradiction to the osteosclerotic phenotype, revealed that the mutant allele is less active than the wild type in the canonical WNT signaling pathway. However, when the mutant and wild type alleles are co expressed, there is a 2 fold increase in canonical WNT activity over that of the wild type construct alone. This work establishes that DVL1 mutations cause a specific subtype of RS, RS OS, and that the osteosclerosis may be the result of an interaction between the wild type and mutant alleles leading to elevated canonical WNT signaling.",2015

Due to the i) anti in flammatory properties of PPS, ii) positive effects in arthritic animals and patients, and iii) extensive safety history, we investigated the use of PPS in the mucopolysaccharidoses (MPS). Comparative studies of oral (daily) and injectable (weekly subcutaneous, s.c.) PPS were carried out in MPS VI rats (Schuchman et al., 2013; Frohbergh et al., 2014). Both studies led to reduced inflammatory markers, improved dentition and skull lengths, re duced tracheal deformities, and markedly improved mobility. Unexpectedly, a significant reduction of urine and tissue glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), was most evident after s.c. administration. Findings were confirmed by analysis of total GAGs and by mass spectrometry. The mechanism(s) leading to PPS mediated GAG reduction in MPS are currently being investigated. Further preclinical studies were carried out in MPS I dogs, with oral (daily) and s.c. (every other week) PPS for >1 year. Significant reductions of inflammatory markers, tissue and urine GAGs were most evident with s.c. administration. Both treatment groups also exhibited reduced carotid and aortic inflamma tion with the absence of plaque formation, a common pathology in the va sculature of MPS I dogs and patients. Based on these findings, two clinical studies evaluating s.c. PPS have been initiated, in adult MPS I (Germany) and MPS II (Japan) patients.

Affected individuals harboured a homozygous missense mutation in CLTCL1 encoding the CHC22 clathrin heavy chain. The mutation p. E330K renders CHC22 non functional in mediating endocytosis at the cell mem brane. We found that CLTCL1 is significantly upregulated in the developing human brain, displaying an expression pattern suggestive of an early neuro developmental role. Guided by the disease phenotype, we investigated the role of CHC22 in two human neural crest differentiation systems; human iPSC derived nociceptors and TRKB dependant SH SY5Y cells. In both there was a significant down regulation of CHC22 upon the onset of neural diffe rentiation. Furthermore, knockdown of CHC22 induced neurite outgrowth in neural precursor cells, which was rescued by stable overexpression of siRNA resistant CHC22 but not by mutant CHC22. Similarly, overexpressi on of wild type, but not mutant, CHC22 blocked neurite outgrowth in cells treated with Retinoic Acid. Using a novel, quantitative proteomics approach we have identified the protein complement of clathrin coated vesicles in neuronal cells, and present insights into the neural specific trafficking de fects resulting from loss of functional CHC22.

Gly306Arg missense mutation in SLC52A2, previously reported in patients with BVVLS2, but located on chromosome 8qter. High recombinati on rate in the telomeric region and use of widely spaced microsatellite mar kers explains why correct linkage was initially missed. Exome sequencing of a second family with two children affected with progressive ataxia, bilateral optic atrophy and mild mental retardation revealed the novel homozygous p. Pro134Leu missense mutation in SLC52A2, confirming that treatable (by riboflavin supplementation) BVVLS2 should be considered for differential diagnosis of syndromic autosomal recessive ataxia. Exome sequencing of a third family with two children affected with progressive ataxia and retinitis pigmentosa and with linkage to 6p23 p21 revealed the p. Ala912Val muta tion in PEX6. Retrospective analysis of peroxisomal markers showed just above normal serum phytanic acid levels but fibroblasts from a subsequent skin biopsy revealed absent peroxisomal catalase immunostaining, peroxi somal ghosts with abnormal structure and markedly increased C26/C22 ratio, confirming the pathogenicity of the p.

Loss of function mutations in both genes are known to cause peroxisome biogenesis disorders (PBDs), such as Zellweger syndrome, which is a group of autosomal recessive dis orders, characterized by developmental brain abnormalities, sensorineural hearing loss, retinopathy, and skeletal, craniofacial, and liver abnormalities. We analyzed plasma, erythrocytes and cultured skin fibroblasts from affec ted individuals for biochemical peroxisomal parameters but did not detect any significant aberrations. However, immunofluorescence microscopy of the fibroblasts revealed a so called mosaic peroxisomal pattern compatible with a very mild peroxisomal dysfunction. The impaired peroxisomal bio genesis in the PEX1 or PEX6 mutant cells could be rescued by transfection of PEX1 or PEX6 cDNA respectively and by functional expression studies we demonstrated which of each mutant allele caused the mild mutant phe notype. Most of these mutations had not been reported previously in PBD patients. Although individuals with HS share subtle clinical features found in PBDs, the overlap is minimal and the diagnosis was not suggested by routine plas ma analyses used to detect PBDs.

Introduction: Otosclerosis, the most common cause of conductive hearing loss in adults, is characterized by the cementing of the stapes bone to the oval window, and is believed to be caused by dysregulation of bone remo deling in the otic capsule. Although considered sporadic, 10 distinct genetic loci (OTSC1 10 ) have been mapped in families with autosomal dominant forms, but no genes have been identified. Materials and Methods: We used a combination of linkage, fine mapping and exome sequencing in a multiplex AD family from the island of New foundland, Canada. Results: We identified a 15 bp in frame deletion in the FOXL1 gene (c.976_990het_delGGGATCCCCTTCCTC) co segregating in all relatives with surgically confirmed otosclerosis. This in frame deletion in FOXL1 is predic ted to cause the removal of 5 amino acids from the highly conserved C ter minus (NM_005250). Screening of >100 patients from Canada and Europe revealed a second family from Ontario, Canada, with the identical mutation in FOXL1 and shared ancestral haplotype. Conclusions: Expression studies using human cells suggest that mutant FOXL1 causes dysregulation of cytokines, supporting the prevailing hypo thesis that patients with otosclerosis undergo activated bone remodeling in the otic capsule. Interestingly, although not present in ethnically matched controls, the novel c.976_990het_delGGGATCCCCTTCCTC deletion in FOXL1 was recently reported at a frequency of 0.16% in Europeans and 0.09% in Africans.

Un like TGDS which has no known function in muscle cells, GPR180 is involved in the regulation of smooth muscle cell growth. The identification of a null GPR180 mutation segregating over two generations with iridocorneal angle dysgenesis which can be regarded as a MCOR endophenotype is consistent with the view that deletions of this gene, with or without the loss of elements regulating the expression of neighboring genes, are the cause of MCOR.",2015

Introduction: Brittle cornea syndrome (BCS) is an inherited connective tis sue disease with a devastating ocular phenotype. Mutations in transcription factors ZNF469 and PRDM5 cause BCS types 1 and 2, respectively. PR domain containing 5 (PRDM5) is hypothesised to exert epigenetic effects on histone and DNA methylation, chromatin organisation, and microRNA regulation, however its role in epigenetic regulation is not fully elucidated. PRDM5 re lated disease offers an in vivo opportunity to observe a subset of epigenetic regulatory mechanisms in an inherited eye disease. Methods and results: We report a retinal vascular phenotype in the eyes of two patients with PRDM5 associated disease, and through mining PRDM5 ChIP seq data performed in murine MC3T3 cells and our expression mi croarray data performed on patient fibroblasts suggest a role for PRDM5 in vasculogenesis. We confirmed PRDM5 binding at a subset of vasculoge nesis related genes in skin fibroblasts by ChIP QPCR. We examined PRDM5 interaction partners by pull down and mass spectrometry and observed di minished interaction of a PRDM5 construct carrying a BCS associated muta tion with repressive complexes, including NuRD complex protein CHD4, and heterochromatin protein 1 binding protein 3 (HP1BP3). We investigated a role for HP1BP3 in vivo, identifying reduced HP1BP3 staining in patient re tinas, and identifying H3K9 di methylation as a molecular mechanism for transcriptional repression at a subset of vasculogenesis related PRDM5 tar get genes. Western blotting studies on patient fibroblasts further suggested a role for dysregulated H3K9 di methylation in vivo.

These rearrangements occur via non allelic homologous recombination (NAHR) between BOLA2 containing directly oriented segmental duplications at BP4 (breakpoint 4) and BP5. Illumina sequencing of 2,551 humans, 86 great apes, a Neanderthal and a Denisovan showed that modern humans carry at least one additional copy of BOLA2 (from 3 to 10 diploid copies) in contrast to apes and archaic hominins. Through Illumina and PacBio sequencing of large insert clones from orangutan and chimpanzee, we identified three in versions in the human lineage after divergence from orangutan, affecting >1Mbp of sequence and 45 genes, together with the addition of ~1Mbp via segmental duplication. The latter includes a ~102kbp BOLA2 segment that duplicated ~183kya, the time when Homo sapiens emerged as a species. We sequenced four human haplotypes and discovered multiple ~102kbp tandem duplications in BP4 and BP5, likely leading to different NAHR pre disposition. We are currently assaying BOLA2 copy number and refining breakpoints in >125 patients with a BP4 BP5 deletion or duplication. BO LA2 is ubiquitously expressed, present in all eukaryotes, and involved in the regulation of iron metabolism. Expression levels in human lymphoblastoids correlate with copy number (r,0.29), expression of genes on 16p13 and 19p13, and of genes encoding mitochondrial and ribosomal proteins. These findings suggest that a possible advantage linked to the emergence of duplicated genes in the last 200,000 years of human evolution, underlies the predisposition to recurrent rearrangements at 16p11.2 associated with autism.",2015
23088,"We identified the cis and trans acting long range chromosomal contacts of five genes located within the 16p11.2 600kb BP4 BP5 copy number variants (CNVs). Its deletion is one of the most frequent known etiologies of autism spectrum disorder (ASD), while this deletion and reciprocal duplication are associated with mirror phenotypes on BMI, head circumference and brain volume. We observed complex chromatin looping between genes located in the proximal 600kb BP4 BP5 and those mapping to the distal 16p11.2 220kb BP2 BP3 region, two loci separated by 650kb, successfully confir med by reciprocal 4C, FISH, Hi C and associations between active regula tory regions. Phenotyping of 137 unrelated carriers of distal 16p11.2 220 kb BP2 BP3 deletion and duplication showed that these CNVs are similarly associated with ASD and reciprocal impacts on BMI and HC. Our results indicate that chromosomal contactsÃ¢ÂÂ maps could uncover func tionally and clinically related genes. Consistent with this hypothesis, loci chromatin contacted by our selected viewpoints are enriched for ASD genes (OR,2.15, P,1.65e 08). Furthermore, we uncovered 16p11.2 600kb BP4 BP5 chromatin loops with (i) the 1q21.1 cytoband, whose deletions and du plications were previously linked to micro and macrocephaly, respectively; (ii) PTEN, mutations of which are associated with a macrocephalic form of ASD; and (iii) the 2p15 cytoband. We enrolled 35 carriers of 2p15 16.1 de letion and duplication and showed that they similarly display mirror pheno types on HC and weight. Finally, we observe that genes differentially expressed in 16p11.2 BP4 BP5 CNV carriers are concomitantly modified in their chromatin interactions, suggesting that disruption of chromatin interplays participates in the ob served phenotypes.

23089,"Mobile genomic element insertions (MEIs) are DNA sequences that can be autonomously copied or moved through the genome, yet their highly repe titive sequence structure makes them difficult to detect and genotype. In addition to being a major evolutionary driver in changing the genomic archi tecture, MEIs can also directly resulted in pathogenic variation in a number of human diseases by inserting into functionally important regions and dis rupting gene function, or indirectly by mediating deletions. We have developed a method to identify both MEIs as well as gene retro transposition insertions (GRiPs) in whole genome sequencing data. Using this tool we screened a cohort of 250 trios selected from the Dutch popula tion and whole genome sequenced to a mean depth of 14x. In total 11,680 MEIs and 5 GRiPs were identified. The majority of the MEIs were rare Alu events (83%) with a frequency of less than 1% (56%). Per individual 1,200 MEIs were identified, including exonic insertions predicted to result in loss of function in known disease genes. In addition we identified and validated 5 de novo MEI events and used the trio design to estimate the genotype error rate (0.4%). Due to developments in NGS it is now possible to perform genome wide identification of both MEI and GRiP events. The discovery of these events in large cohorts provides new insights into the role of genomic variation with positional effects. Grants: ERC DENOVO 281964, NWO 184.021.007",2015
23090,"Trisomy 21 is a model disorder of altered gene expression. We have pre viously used a pair of monozygotic twins discordant for T21 to study the global dysregulation of gene expression, without the noise due to genetic va riation among individuals (Nature:508;345 350;2014). The majority of pre vious studies focused on aneuploidies were conducted ÃÂ¿n cell populations or tissues. Studies on gene and allelic expression behavior at the single cell level, may reveal important biological insights regarding the cellular impact of aneuploidy and elucidate the fundamental mechanisms of gene dosage. In this study we employed allele specific expression (ASE) using RNAseq from 352 single cell fibroblasts (172 Normal and 180 T21 cells) from the pair of monozygotic twins discordant for T21. A considerable number of heterozygous sites throughout the non chr21 genome were expressed mo noallelically (Normal: 73.2 % monoallelic in 559,134 observations, and T21: 78.8 % monoallelic in 573,670 observations). There was also considerable monoallelic expression for chr21 genes in Normal and surprisingly in T21 cells as well (Normal: 67,2 % monoallelic in 4,985 observations, and T21: 76.07 % monoallelic in 6,723 observations). This metric was used to classify genes on chr21 according to the level of monoallelic expression (9 monoal lelic, 29 intermediate, 2 biallelic). We hypothesize that different classes of genes contribute with different mechanisms to the phenotypic variability of Down Syndrome. Furthermore we have made a preliminary observation that genomewide T21 cells showed more monoallelic expression than the normal cells, but more analysis is needed to confirm these results. This stu dy provides a fundamental understanding of the allele specific expression behavior in T21.",2015

Maintenance of a balanced euploid genome is a key requisite for the success of all multicellular organisms. Broken chromosomes trigger repair pathways and are known to block or delay mitosis. As a consequence, chromosome se gregation is generally thought to accurately transmit intact chromosomes. Estimates of the whole chromosomal error rates derived from karyotyping and FISH studies of cell lines or stimulated white blood cells, range bet ween 2 4x10 2 per cell division. The occurrence of segmental imbalances is estimated to be 5x10 4 per cell division. Sporadic studies of single cell genome wide CNV analysis suggested that the error rate might be higher than currently estimated. To obtain accurate measures of chromosomal er ror rates, we plated fibroblast and analyzed the genomes of two daughter cells following a single cell division, using array based approaches. In total 152 cells (76 mitoses) from 5 different normal control fibroblast cell lines were analyzed. At least one imbalance was detected in 23 cells, giving a an euploidy rate of 5.3 25% (median,15.1%) in the different cell lines tested. In conclusion, the chromosomal stability is more than 100 times lower than current dogma, showing that chromosomal instability is a common place and putting the efficacy of the DNA repair mechanisms and control check points in question.",2015
23092,"Chromothripsis represents an extreme class of complex chromosome re arrangements (CCRs) with major effects on chromosomal architecture. Although recent studies have associated chromothripsis with congenital abnormalities, the incidence and pathogenic effects of this phenomenon require further investigation. Here, we analyzed the genomes of three fami lies in which chromothripsis rearrangements were transmitted from a mo ther to her child. The chromothripsis in the mothers resulted in completely balanced rearrangements involving 8 23 breakpoint junctions across 3 5 chromosomes. Two mothers did not show any phenotypic abnormalities, although 3 13 protein coding genes were affected by breakpoints. Unba lanced but stable transmission of a subset of the derivative chromosomes caused apparently de novo complex copy number changes in two children. This resulted in gene dosage changes, which are likely responsible for their severe congenital phenotypes. In contrast, one child with severe congenital disease harbored all three chromothripsis chromosomes from his healthy mother, but one of the chromosomes acquired de novo rearrangements lea ding to copy number changes. These results show that the human genome can tolerate extreme reshuffling of chromosomal architecture, including breakage of multiple protein coding genes, without noticeable phenotypic effects. The presence of chromothripsis in healthy individuals affects repro duction and is expected to substantially increase the risk of miscarriages, spontaneous abortions and severe congenital disease.",2015

Quality assessment has long been associated with laboratory, but not clini cal, services. To address this gap, in 2012 the ESHG Genetic Services Quality Committee (GSQC) explored the needs for a European Quality Assessment (EQA) scheme for genetic counselling. All European national societies of human genetics were surveyed. All participating 15 countries expressed a need for an EQA for genetic counselling services. A proposal for achieving an EQA for genetic counselling was launched at an ESHG satellite symposium in 2013. The working group wrote four case scenarios in the fields of cardiogenetics, oncogenetics, monogenetic disor ders and dysmorphology. Each scenario started with a referral letter and consisted of multiple stages, to reflect an episode of clinical care. At each stage more information was given and a number of questions presented. For each question, consensus answers were obtained by the author of the case, a patient organisation and at least two other experts.

There are bene fits for directing womenÃ¢ÂÂs treatment and providing information for families, but there are ethical concerns about testing this group at this point. These women may be elderly, unwell and may have little or no family history of cancer. Those found to have a mutation then have the task of communicating this sensitive information to their families. We explore the experiences of women recently diagnosed with epithelial ovarian cancer who have been offered RGT through a project considering the feasibility of integrating RGT into routine oncology services (The GTEOC Study). Using data collected from twelve semi structured interviews with women that were analysed using Interpretive Phenomenological Analysis, we consider how individuals make sense of genetic testing within their broader cancer and life experiences. Our results highlight the sensitivity of the timing of discussions about gene tic testing during a womanÃ¢ÂÂs cancer journey. Women have much emotional work to do as they confront their cancer diagnosis, their own mortality and the impact on their family and others. Though genetic testing is welcomed during this time by the women we interviewed, the burdens and comple xities are acknowledged. This foregrounds the necessity for appropriate support for this patient group. Our work contributes to current discussions about the ethical issues arising from the introduction of genetic testing in mainstream medicine.",2015
23095,"Background: A growing number of young people are undertaking predicti ve testing for adult onset conditions. However, there is a lack of empirical evidence about their information and support needs. Aim: To produce the evidence for, and to develop materials to help parents and professionals in sharing information with young people about serious adult onset genetic conditions. Methods: Clinic observations and interviews with young people and parents; an analysis of practitionersÃ¢ÂÂ case notes and online web fora for young people; collaborations with patient groups and interviews with genetics professionals. We used two adult onset inherited disorders as exemplars: HuntingtonÃ¢ÂÂs disease and Familial Hypercholesterolaemia. Results: In both patient groups the process of genetic testing could be a positive and empowering experience for young people, but for some pati ents there were gaps in the provision of age appropriate information and emotional support, resulting in poor experiences. Children and young peop le could question their own risk earlier than literature suggests. Genetics professionals used a range of strategies to support communication between parents and children, but one third gave limited advice and felt under skilled in this area. Some parents also felt inadequate time was given to discussion of disclosure strategies. We helped patient groups develop evidence based materials for children and young people. Conclusions: Practitioners should give serious consideration to parents concerns about disclosure even in treatable inherited conditions, and the provision of age appropriate information. Facilitating family communicati on should be a goal of genetic counselling, but training for practitioners is needed. KFK was funded by a CSO Fellowship, Scottish Government.",2015

Background A preconception carrier screening (PCS) test can detect whether a couple has an increased risk of having a child with a monogenetic disease. Next ge neration sequencing (NGS) allows the testing of many genes or diseases si multaneously. The University Medical Center Groningen (UMCG) developed an NGS PCS test for couples covering 70 very severe, autosomal recessive diseases simultaneously and screening for all variants. This is the first non commercial population based PCS test to be offered to prospective couples in a healthcare setting in Europe. So far, little is known about how potential users view such a population based PCS test. MethodsWe examined potential usersÃ¢ÂÂ intentions to undergo the test and preferences regarding who should offer the test. Data was collected in March 2014 by means of an online survey among 500 people belonging to the target popu lation (people aged 18 40, with a partner and living in the Netherlands). Results One third of the respondents said they intend to take this test were it to be offered. They prefer this to be offered via their GP and via face to face pre test consultation. Fifty eight percent is willing to pay for the test, up to a cost of 5,000 euro. Testing for later onset, treatable diseases or even traits (e.g sportivity) is valued less.

23098,"Intellectual disability (ID) disorders, due to their frequency and enormous genetic and phenotypic heterogeneity, represent a major unmet challenge in health care and diagnostics. A comprehensive and systematic understanding of ID disorders and their underlying biology is still limited. We established a curated database of 650 currently known ID genes, linked them to various functional datasets and classified them according to ID manifestation and severity and 27 associated core clinical features such as organic or neuro logical anomalies. Using this integrated resource we show that ID genes are substantially enriched in protein protein interactions and co expression, highest in the hippocampus. 86% of ID genes fall into 32 common Gene On tology based molecular processes: metabolism and nervous system deve lopment among the largest, and hedgehog and glutamate signalling among the most enriched groups. Identification of highly enriched functional the mes and phenotypes systematically revealed characteristic phenoprofiles of process defined IDopathies including chromatin and DNArepairopathies. Strikingly, classification of ID genes according to their associated clinical phenotypes efficiently breaks them down into subsets with significantly elevated biological coherence and allows ID genes to predict each other. Fur thermore, we utilised custom made datasets on ID gene function in Droso phila. Early onset behavioural and specific morphological wing phenotypes were characteristic for ID genes in general, and several fly phenotypes were particularly representative for specific human clinical phenotype classes. Our study and resource provide systematic insights into the molecular and clinical landscape of ID disorders and prove the utility of systematic human and cross species phenomic analyses in highly heterogeneous genetic dis orders.",2015

Genetic mutations account for about half of the currently undiagnosed cases, and despite recent successes in identifying some of the mutations responsible, it has been suggested that up to 1,000 further genes remain to be identified. To identify genes involved in brain malformation and potentially associated with ID, we are collaborating with the Sanger Mouse Genetics Project (MGP), allied to the International Mouse Phenotyping Consortium (IMPC), to sy stematically study the neuroanatomy of the MGP/IMPC knockout mouse strains. We are measuring a standardized set of 78 brain parameters across 22 brain regions to detect a variety of mechanisms that underlie brain mal formation disorders, such as aberrant cell proliferation, neuronal migration defects or elevated cell death rates.

KDM5C is a chromatin remodelling regulator with histone deme thylase activity for di and trimethylated histone 3 lysine 4 acting as tran scriptional repressor during brain development and neuronal maturation. With Regulatory Element 1 Silencing Transcription factor (REST), a critical regulator of the spatio temporal transition of neural progenitors to neurons, KDM5C co occupies the promoters of a subset of REST target genes. We identified a disease path, linking functionally KDM5C to another XLID/Epilepsy gene, encoding the homeotic transcription factor ARX, whose mu tations impair severely KDM5C transcript regulation. Furthermore, we analysed two additional XLID proteins that also bind KDM5C promoter. They are PHD Finger Protein 8 (PHF8), a H3K9 deme thylase; and Zinc Finger Protein 711 (ZNF711), a transcriptional factor, which role is almost unknown. We observed that PHF8 and ZNF711, which co occupy the target promoter, induce cooperatively the KDM5C stimula tion. This activity seems to be ARX independent and we propose that the transcriptional induction by ARX does not synergize with the action of the PHF8/ZNF711 complex.

The single base change abolished bin ding of the YY1 transcription factor at a highly conserved sequence proxi mal to the HCFC1 transcription start site resulting in loss of transcriptional repression. We employed ex vivo models of embryonic neural development to show that this change was likely pathogenic; over expression of HCFC1 caused cell cycle exit and differentiation of neural progenitor cells (NPCs), and reductions in neurite growth of hippocampal neurons. Intriguingly, mis sense mutations that result in almost complete loss of HCFC1 have also been reported to cause Cobalamin type X (CblX), a VitaminB12 metabolic disor der with severe neurodevelopmental impairment including intractable epi lepsy. We extended our studies to show that in contrast to over expression, modest reduction (~50%) of Hcfc1 expression promoted the cell cycling of NPCs at the expense of differentiation, and enhanced neurite growth of neurons. We further identified four additional missense variants in HCFC1 that segregate with ID in four families. Three of these variants caused partial loss of function in multiple cell based assays, including complementation of neurite growth. In line with only partial loss of function, metabolic features of CblX were largely absent in affected individuals. Our identification and functional assessment of HCFC1 mutations together with descriptions of a broadened phenotypic spectrum reveals an emerging genotype phenotype correlation, dependent also on HCFC1 abundance and not just function.

Therefore, we also assessed C5orf42 by evaluation of the pri mary cilia in affected individuals and in ovo RNAi silencing in chicken em bryos.

PLK4 individuals also demonstrated retinopathy, a phenotypic feature normally associated with cilium dysfunction.

Microcephaly (MC) is a clinical condition characterized by abnormal small head circumference for the respective age and sex which closely correlates with reduced brain volume and most of the times with intellectual disabili ty. Many syndromes encompassing MC have been described and although several genes have been recently reported in literature, a massive number of unexplained cases still exist. We have collected and performed whole exome sequencing (WES) on 21 patients displaying syndromic forms of MC and on their parents for trio based variant filtering. Since most of the index patients were sporadic, the majority of causative variants were suspected to be de novo. However, recessive models have also been taken into account. We were able to identify causative mutation in 10/21 patients. For the re maining cases, we found de novo mutations in 8 novel candidate genes. We used the zebrafish model to test the pathogenicity of candidate variants. The morphant model for one of our main candidates showed a 10% head size reduction, while preliminary mRNA overexpression data unexpectedly sho wed a slight head area increase. Our cohort was enriched with patients dis playing de novo mutations in CASK, responsible for an X linked syndrome of MC and pontocerebellar hypoplasia. CASK morphants displayed a pronoun ced head size reduction, while anti acetylated tubulin staining revealed pro minent cerebellar abnormalities. For both genes, rescue experiments and further functional assays are pending. Fonds Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek Vlaanderen Grant nr 11O4813N to F. C.",2015
23109,"Background: Differences in DNA methylation pattern between subcuta neous adipose tissue (SAT) and omental visceral adipose tissue (OVAT) may help, together with corresponding changes in the mRNA profile, to elucidate variances in metabolic activity. In the present study we examined genome wide promoter methylation and mRNA expression pattern in 80 paired hu man SAT and OVAT samples including lean as well as obese subjects. Methods: DNA methylation analysis was performed using methylated DNA immunoprecipitation and subsequent hybridising on Affymetrix Human Promoter 1.0R tilling arrays. Expression profiles were generated using Il lunima human HT 12 chips. All genes with at least 30% methylation diffe rence between SAT and OVAT or lean and obese subjects in the same fat depot were taken forward to overlap analysis with corresponding mRNA expression levels. Results: We identified 35 genes in the lean and 38 in the obese subgroup conferring negative correlation between DNA methylation and mRNA ex pression comparing SAT and OVAT . 37 genes were found in the SAT and 76 in the OVAT subgroup comparing lean and obese individuals. The gene lists included known candidate genes such as PPARG but also unexpected genes, e.g. BHMT .Conclusion: To the best of our knowledge, we show the first genome wide epigenetic data set comparing SAT and OVAT in a considerably large cohort. We identified significant differences in genome wide DNA methylation pat tern in paired human SAT and OVAT samples from lean and obese subjects with corresponding changes in mRNA levels.

ESHG. ORG 42Back to inde x methods allow to systematically investigate the regulatory effects of genetic variants by screening the genome for correlations between allelic variants and gene expression (expression Quantitative Trait Loci / eQTLs) or DNA methylation (meQTLs). Several studies have investigated the occurrence of QTLs in human brain tissue; however the overlap of QTLs between these studies is relatively low. We employed 150 fresh frozen hippocampal biopsy samples derived from surgery of patients with chronic pharmaco resistant temporal lobe epilepsy and performed genome wide SNP genotyping, expression and methylation profiling. Data from 115 brain samples was correlated using a linear regres sion model. To limit the effect of confounding factors, surrogate variables were included. At a false discovery rate threshold of 5%, 641 RNA transcripts and 19,953 CpGs showed a genetic regulation by common variants in cis. Enrichment testing of our QTL data among the top hits from the public NHGRI GWAS catalogue revealed an overlap for brain disorders. Overall, we present an integrative functional analysis to explore the effects of common DNA sequence variants on DNA methylation and mRNA expres sion. In contrast to all published studies, our samples were collected from fresh frozen and not post mortem brain tissue. Therefore, the identified QTLs provide an extremely valuable resource for functional annotation of SNPs and will help guiding the interpretation of GWAS hits in genetically complex brain disorders.",2015
23111,"Genomic imprinting is defined as the mutually exclusive expression of either the paternally or maternally inherited allele. Imprinted genes are implicated in the etiology of rare syndromes and have been associated with common diseases such as diabetes and cancer. We aim to identify novel imprinting genes using a Single Cell (SC) RNA sequencing approach. The detection of average to low expressed genes allows a more comprehensive profiling of the allelic imbalance of each gene as previously reported (Borel et al, AJHG, 2015). From the proband of a family trio, 380 individual fibroblasts were RNA sequenced and more than 770Ã¢ÂÂ000 heterozygous SNVs were identi fied by WGS (25x). For each gene, we analysed the allelic specific expres sion using an in house pipeline. We modeled the likelihood of a gene to be monoallelically expressed with a beta binomial distribution and evaluated the significance of the aggregate monoallelic ratio (reads sum of the most frequent allele per site / total reads) with the log likelihood test. Genes presenting with a significant (adjusted p value <0.01) aggregate monoalle lic ratio between 0.9 1 were retained. We were able to detect 634 putative imprinted genes and 16 known imprinted genes. We validated 118 of these genes in 165 SC fibroblasts from an independent individual; in addition, 19 were imprinted in 48 SC lymphoblasts from the same individual. A SC tran scriptome analysis provides an unprecedented opportunity to discover the full repertoire of imprinted genes per cell type, and will contribute to the understanding of the molecular pathophysiology of genetic disorders.

23112,"We investigate expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) and search for SNPs that have a parent of origin effect (POE) with respect to transcript le vels in cis. We applied our recently published algorithm [Hoggart et al 2014] to tease out SNPs where the contribution of the maternal allele to the nearby gene expression is different to that of the paternal allele. In the case where each parentÃ¢ÂÂs allele has a different effect, the variance in the expression le vels within the heterozygous group will be larger than the variance within either homozygous group. We used genome wide genotyping and gene ex pression data from the EGCUT and Groningen cohorts and ran the quicktest software to estimate the difference in effects. Controlling the type I error at 5%, we selected 4,162 of the 59 million SNP gene pairs, where we could reject the null hypothesis of no difference between paternal and maternal effects. We applied conservative pruning (based on LD) to end up with 495 candidate lead SNP gene expression pairs, where the parentsÃ¢ÂÂ effects are expected to be different. By combining the marginal effects from [Westra et al 2013] and our observed POE estimates for the differences between maternal and paternal effects we found that 135 of these 495 candidates exhibit classical POE, i.e. where the effect from one parent is exactly zero. These 135 candidates are currently being validated in ~700 trios from the Framingham study to confirm that the expression levels differ between he terozygous individuals that inherited the two alleles from different parents.",2015
23113,"Recently, we described CHCHD10 as a novel gene responsible for mtDNA instability disorder by studying a large family with a late onset phenotype including motor neuron disease, cognitive decline looking like frontotem poral dementia (FTD), cerebellar ataxia and mitochondrial myopathy with accumulation of multiple mtDNA deletions. Subsequently, other groups and ourselves, identified other CHCHD10 mutations in several cohorts with fron totemporal dementia amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (FTD ALS) or with pure familial or sporadic ALS or late onset spinal motor neuropathy (SMAJ).Here, we show that CHCHD10 is a component of the mitochondrial inner membrane organizing system (MINOS) complex. The expression of CHCHD10 mutant allele leads to MINOS complex disassembly and loss of mitochondrial cristae in patient fibroblasts. The abnormalities of the inner membrane are responsible for nucleoid disorganization leading to defect in mtDNA repair after oxidative stress, which explains the multiple mtDNA deletions found in patient muscles. Interestingly, the expression of CHCHD10 mutant alleles inhibits apoptosis by preventing cytochrome c release. This result supports previous studies suggesting that, in some ALS models, motor neuron death can occur via caspase independent apoptotic mechanism. In conclusion, we show for the first time that mutations in a gene encoding a MINOS component are responsible for human disorder. Dissecting the cellular pathways disrupted by the expression of CHCHD10 mutant alleles represents, therefore, a golden opportunity to gain powerful insight into the sequence of events that link mitochondrial dysfunction with neurodegene rative disorders.

CoQ10, a lipoidal quinone, is an essential component of the electron transport chain (ETC), shuttling elec trons from complex I/II to complex III. By whole exome sequencing we identified five individuals carrying biallelic mutations in COQ4.

The clinical phenotypes of the five subjects varied wi dely, but four had a prenatal or perinatal onset with early fatal outcome. Two unrelated individuals presented with severe hypotonia, bradycardia, respi ratory insufficiency and heart failure; two sisters showed antenatal cerebel lar hypoplasia, neonatal respiratory distress syndrome, and epileptic ence phalopathy. The fifth subject had early onset but slowly progressive clinical course, dominated by neurological deterioration with hardly any involve ment of other organs. CoQ10 amount was reduced in all available specimens from mutant subjects, often associated with decrease of CoQ10 dependent ETC complex activities and reduced oxygen consumption rate in cultured cells. The pathogenic role of all identified mutations was experimentally va lidated in a recombinant yeast model: oxidative growth, strongly impaired in strains lacking COQ4, was corrected by expressing a human wild type COQ4 cDNA but failed to be corrected by expressing COQ4 cDNAs with any of the nucleotide variants identified in affected subjects.

Ketone bodies are mainly produced in the liver and used as an energy source in extrahe patic tissues. Currently only two genetic defects in ketone body metabolism are known, whereas most patients with recurrent ketoacidosis remained unresolved. We performed targeted exome sequencing of homozygous genomic regions in a patient from consanguineous parents with recurrent massive ketoaci dosis. We sequenced the main candidate gene and related genes in a cohort of 96 patients suspected of a ketolysis defect, followed by functional, bioche mical and clinical characterization. We identified a homozygous frameshift mutation in the monocarboxylate transporter 1 (MCT1/SLC16A1), a known transporter of monocarboxylates including lactate and ketones. Subsequent analysis of MCT1 and related ge nes in our cohort yielded 6 additional truncating mutations and 1 missense mutation in MCT1. We identified both homozygous and heterozygous inac tivating mutations, correlating with the depth of ketoacidosis. Immunoblot analyses revealed reduced and absent levels of MCT1 in heterozygous and homozygous patients, respectively. A lactate transport assay in erythrocytes showed absence of transport in homozygous patients and reduced trans port in heterozygotes. We show that MCT1 deficiency is a novel cause of profound ketoacidosis. Our results indicate that MCT1 is pivotal for import of ketones in extrahepa tic tissues. Contrary to the current concept of freely diffusing ketone bodies, our study shows that during catabolic stress, facilitated transport of ketones by MCT1 is essential to allow adequate ketone utilization and maintain acid base balance.",2015
23116,"Haemochromatosis type 4 is a rare form of primary iron overload transmit ted as an autosomal dominant trait caused by mutations in the gene enco ding the iron transport protein ferroportin 1 (SLC40A1 ). SLC40A1 mutations fall into two functional categories (loss versus gain of function) underlying two distinct clinical entities (haemochromatosis type 4A B). However, the vast majority of SLC40A1 mutations are rare missense variations, with only a few showing strong evidence of causality. The present study reports the results of an integrated approach collecting genetic and phenotypic data from 44 suspected haemochromatosis type 4 patients, with comprehensive structural (3D model) and functional annotations. 1,2 Causality was demon strated for 10 missense variants, showing a clear dichotomy between the two haemochromatosis type 4 subtypes. Two subgroups of loss of function mutations were distinguished: one impairing cell surface expression and one altering only iron egress. A new gain of function mutation was identi fied, and the degradation of ferroportin on hepcidin binding was shown to probably depend on the integrity of a large extracellular loop outside of the hepcidin binding domain. Eight further missense variations, on the other hand, were shown to have no discernible effects at either protein or RNA level; these were found in apparently isolated patients and were associated with a less severe phenotype. The present findings illustrate the importance of combining in silico and biochemical approaches to fully distinguish pa thogenic SLC40A1 mutations from benign variants. This has profound impli cations for patient management. 1 Le Gac G et al. Hum Mut. 2013;34:1371 80 2 Callebaut I et al. Hum Mol Genet. 2014;23:4479 90.",2015
23117,"Genetic defects are responsible for the majority of primary renal diseases leading to end stage renal disease. The risk of recurrence after transplan tation depends on the genotype. Genetic testing becomes increasingly im portant for proper clinical management and therapeutic and prognostic issues, but there is a need for novel comprehensive, time and cost efficient strategies. We analysed 605 unrelated patients by a customized NGS panel of 347 genes for atypical haemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS) and heredi tary glomerular disorders (nephrotic syndrome, FSGS, Alport syndrome, MPGN, C3 glomerulopathies) which often show clinical and genetic overlap. The alternative complement pathway is typically overactivated in aHUS and C3 glomerulopathies, but genes implicated in coagulation and haemostasis play a pivotal role too. Secondary triggers (e. g., hypertension, pregnancy, transplantation, infection) and predisposing polymorphisms lower the threshold for disease onset. Our study represents the by far largest cohort analysed by comprehensive genetic testing. We present new disease genes and demonstrate that variations in more than one gene contribute to the phenotype with variable expressivity and incomplete penetrance. We show that detailed information on the genotype is crucial for decisions on trans plantation, recurrence risk and treatment such as when and how long an ex pensive drug like the monoclonal antibody eculizumab should be given. The diseases discussed represent an interesting model that may help to explain basic genetic principles not confined to renal disorders and of relevance for all geneticists.

TSCP requires only 50ng of input DNA and we multiplex to sequence 96 samples at a time on a HiSeq2500, generating median coverage of 500X.

This test has replaced nu merous alternative diagnostic sequencing tests, providing a single laborato ry workflow and financial savings. Data is analysed for a panel of genes appropriate for the clinical presenta tion. To date 190 virtual gene panels have been developed, incorporating 1085 genes, averaging 7.9 genes per panel. Almost 1/3 of panels established (60) are single genes, requested for patients with homogeneous clinical presentations. Single gene analysis yields a higher mutation detection rate (40%) than panel testing (27%), however we will present data showing that panel testing would increase the diagnostic yield further if applied instead of single gene analysis. Gene panels are established on demand. As long as the required gene(s) are captured and yield good sequencing coverage, a diagnostic test, which may be unavailable or unaffordable by alternative methodology, can be offered almost immediately.

Mutations in more than 300 genes are known to cause PIDD and the subtype symptoms can be overlap ping. Both disease severity, which can range from mild to life threatening, and treatment options depend on the genetic aetiology. We examined the utility of whole exome sequencing (WES) to detect disease causing single nucleotide variants (SNVs) and copy number variations (CNVs) in PIDD patients. Patients were recruited from Texas ChildrenÃ¢ÂÂs Hospital (Houston, US) and Oslo University Hospital (Norway). As of February 2015, patients with extensive immunological and genetic testing from 258 families have been WES tested. PIDD causing SNVs were identified in 100 of the families. A computational CNV prediction pipeline was applied to the exome data to identify PIDD causing CNVs. The predicted PIDD causing CNVs were valida ted using a custom array CGH (aCGH) platform with exon level resolution. The same aCGH was also applied to a selection of the families with negative WES. PIDD causing CNVs were identified in 10 families, involving MAGT1, SMARCAL1, DOCK8, IL7R, MYB, PGM3, DKC1, and FANCA. Five of the CNVs spanned between 1 4 exons and would not have been detected by traditio nal diagnostic aCGH, with a typical resolution of 50 kb.

However, diagnostic WGS pipelines are yet to be validated as a clinical tool in the context of heterogeneous genetic disease. Methods: We surveyed the diagnostic yield of an accredited, conventional next generation sequencing (NGS) diagnostic testing method for 537 pa tients with genetically and clinically heterogeneous single gene disorders (specifically, inherited retinal disease). A subset of 47 patients also under went WGS, and we compare the diagnostic yield of a WGS pipeline to that achieved by the conventional NGS diagnostic test. Findings: The WGS pipeline achieved similar sensitivity and specificity rates to the targeted NGS diagnostic testing method. Importantly, the WGS pipe line detected pathogenic variants that were not identified by current NGS diagnostics and, amongst the 47 patients, facilitated an 85% increase in dia gnostic yield. If applied to the 537 patients surveyed, weighted estimates suggest that the WGS pipeline could provide a 27% increase in diagnostic yield. Interpretation: We demonstrate the capability of a WGS pipeline to detect pathogenic genetic variants missed by current methodologies, and to iden tify essential modifications for current and future molecular diagnostic practice.

They suggest the possible negative psychological im pacts from identifying childrenÃ¢ÂÂs genetic risks and the loss of their future autonomy, are outweighed by the potential benefits, both for the health of the child and also their parents. Yet ACMG do not recommend disclosure of childrenÃ¢ÂÂs carrier status to fa milies, despite the potential benefits to the child, due to the possible health implications for carriers of some X linked conditions, such as Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD), and their parents, who may benefit from re productive choices.

We draw on data from qualitative inter views with 17 genetic health professionals and 33 parents of children with genetic conditions (cystic fibrosis, DMD and haemophilia), exploring the practices, views and experiences of carrier testing in children to inform this discussion. We consider these parentsÃ¢ÂÂ reactions to learning their childÃ¢ÂÂs carrier status and their intentions to communicate carrier information to their children, and how this might impact on their abilities to manage inci dental findings from diagnostic WES/WGS.

23127,"Introduction:The empirical body of evidence on parentsÃ¢ÂÂ decision making processes for whole exome sequencing (WES) and return of unsolicited findings (UFs) in pediatric disease diagnostics is limited. Yet understanding these processes and the differences between them is needed for developing morally respon sible policy. Method:Twenty semi structured interviews were conducted with parents of child ren ages <1 Ã¢ÂÂ 17, after consenting to WES (trio analyses), but prior to feed back of results. Results:Parental preferences for return of UFs, reasoning patterns, and difficulties experienced in decision making diverged. Context specific factors of per sonsÃ¢ÂÂ situations, such as uncertainty about whether their child will develop into an autonomous adult capable of making future disclosure decisions, and differences in personsÃ¢ÂÂ moral starting points clarify this divergence. Parents valued being given choices over most outcome categories of UFs for various reasons. One reason was that decisional discretion necessitates contemplation of the possible future consequences of hearing, or not hea ring, certain results Ã¢ÂÂ thereby ensuring parentsÃ¢ÂÂ confidence of having made a well informed decision for WES. A need was sometimes also expressed by parents to understand the moral argumentation behind the centerÃ¢ÂÂs policy choices regarding opt ins and opt outs for certain UFs, since seeing different arguments can help one weigh alternatives in a systematic manner, thus, adding to oneÃ¢ÂÂs confidence about having decided responsibly. Conclusion:These insights inform ethical theorizing on how policy for WES and UFs should be structured in order to ensure personsÃ¢ÂÂ well informed decision making.

23128,"Human rights are engrained in international law. They offer many advan tages to translational and transnational genome science centred on data sharing. First, their universalizing force can overcome site specific factors that drive a wedge between research initiative/funder data sharing policies and harmonization. Second, because human rights have both political and legal dimensions, they reach beyond the moral appeals of bioethics and can provide a more robust governance framework for the regulation of geno mics research. If health care becomes a primary location for collecting the phenotypic and genetic data needed to create learning systems for research and clinical care, we need to reinforce the self regulatory codes of ethics of genomic researchers, and clinicians with legally recognized human rights, that is, a co regulatory system. Third, human rights belong to groups as well as individuals (creating a reciprocity between the individual and public le vel) and reach beyond classic negative duties (i.e. forbidding State actors from interfering with the rights of individuals), to positive, more progressive duties, thereby urging action by governments (and ideally, industry, funders, and researchers) to share the data, technologies and knowledge that are the fruits of our science to achieve a goal desired by all, such as health. Fourth, human rights can foster responsible protection in three critical areas: priva cy; anti discrimination, and procedural fairness. This presentation will use the Framework for Responsible Sharing of Genomic and Health Related Data of the Global Alliance for Genomics and Health as a case study for harnessing human rights as mobilizing force for international data sharing.",2015

These suggestions are commonly made from a li beralist vantage point, in which it is held that patients or consumers should be free to define the value of genomic tests for themselves and to access genomic tests through the healthcare system or through commercial chan nels that may lack clinical utility, strictly defined. A paradigmatic example is ApoE testing: while there are limited therapeutic options for AlzheimerÃ¢ÂÂs disease (i.e. clinical utility), many people prefer knowing their genetic risk to make life choices or to psychologically prepare for possible scenarios. Further, genomic tests for non medical traits (e.g. ancestry, professional or sports related testing) can be interesting or fun and thus have personal va lue for consumers. But does a Ã¢ÂÂconsumer valueÃ¢ÂÂ imply that there is personal utility in a genomic test? I will argue that genomic tests that lack predictive ability cannot have personal utility. Further, I will argue descriptively and normatively that the notion of personal utility should be demarcated nar rowly in order for it to have a role in the ethical evaluation of genomic tests. I will set forth the conditions sine qua non of personal utility in genomic tests, including clinical validity and reasonable potential use. Often, the notion of personal utility is used to ethically justify genomic testing offers to the pu blic; such justifications, I will point out, are flawed.",2015
23130,"Cornelia de Lange syndrome (CdLS) is a variable multisystem disorder with a broad phenotypic spectrum. Most typically affected individuals carry de novo heterozygous loss of function mutations in NIPBL. Mutations in other components of the sister chromatid cohesion system, SMC1A , HDAC8, SMC3 and RAD21 , result in phenotypes that overlap with CdLS but which can be highly atypical. In the present study, a recurrent de novo mutation was iden tified in the X linked gene, NAA10 (c.247C>T [p. Arg83Cys]) in four unrelated female individuals through trio based exome sequencing and re sequencing. A fifth female was found to carry a de novo mutation affecting the adjacent codon (p. Arg82Gln). Three of these cases have a CdLS like appearance, with the growth and dysmorphic features in all individuals being variable. Ana lysis of X chromosome inactivation revealed complete skewing of X inacti vation in 3/5 cases and borderline skewing in the remaining two. In vivo analysis of a patient fibroblast cell line, only expressing the mutant allele, showed no obvious defects in cell division. Molecular modelling suggests that the p. Arg83Cys conversion is likely to alter binding of NAA10 to ace tyl CoA. A significant reduction in auto acetylation of NAA10 was observed in the presence of the p. Arg83Cys mutation in vitro. Furthermore, mouse embryonic fibroblast cell lines derived from CRISPR induced p. Arg83Cys knock in mouse embryos are being analysed for further characterisation of this mutation in relation to cohesin function. A detailed clinical comparison to published cases of NAA10 mutations will also be presented. Our results identify recurrent de novo mutations in NAA10 as a possible cause of CdLS overlapping phenotypes.",2015
23131,"Cohesinopathies are rare disorders arising from a dysfunction in the cohesin pathway, which enables chromosome segregation and proper cell division. So far, seven genes from this pathway have been reported in human disease. Five of them are involved in autosomal dominant (NIPBL, SMC3, RAD21) or X linked (SMC1A and HDAC8) Cornelia de Lange syndrome, and two of them in autosomal recessive Roberts (ESCO2) and Warsaw Breakage syndromes (DDX11). All are severe neurodevelopmental conditions characterized by intellectual disability, growth retardation, microcephaly, limb defects and facial dysmorphism. STAG1 belongs to the STAG subunit of the core cohesin complex, which, along with three other subunits, mediates cohesion between sister chroma tids. Here, we report an international series of four unrelated individuals, 3 males and 1 female, aged 8 to 33 years, referred for moderate to severe intel lectual disability that could be attributed to STAG1 haploinsufficiency. Three had history of intrauterine growth retardation, two with prenatal onset microcephaly, one with post natal growth retardation. One individual had epilepsy, two had autistic features. The four patients shared common facial features, with widely spaced incisors, thin eyebrows, and high nasal bridge. The mechanism for haploinsufficiency was a small deletion encompassing STAG1 diagnosed by array CGH in two individuals, an intragenic deletion in STAG1 found by whole genome analysis in one individual, and a missense heterozygous mutation (c.641A>G) revealed by exome analysis in the last patient. All the variants were shown to be de novo. This series provides evi dence that STAG1 haploinsufficiency leads to a new cohesinopathy with a clinically recognizable phenotype.",2015
23132,"In 2012 members of our group reported that de novo mutations in the histo ne methyl transferase MLL (renamed KMT2A) underlie a distinct phenotype of hypertrichosis, short stature, intellectual disability and a distinctive facial appearance consistent with a diagnosis of Wiedemann Steiner syndrome in five individuals. Other phenotypic features observed were feeding difficul ties, behavioural difficulties, skeletal abnormalities and cardiac defects. We have now identified 39 individuals with mutations in KMT2A. Our co hort contains 37 sporadic individuals and a set of monozygous twins. In total 19 individuals with KMT2A mutations have undergone detailed clini cal phenotyping by members of our group and we have detailed phenotype information for 20 further patients with KMT2A mutations. Recruitment to our study, sequencing and detailed phenotyping is on going. Our study has shown that hypertrichosis, which was initially identified, as a typical feature is variable in individuals with KMT2A mutations. We have expanded the list of phenotypic abnormalities associated with KMT2A mu tations and report novel features including seizures, renal abnormalities, plantar fat pads, ptosis, and malrotation of the bowel. Review of the facial appearance of individuals of KMT2A mutations shows that the facial phe notype evolves over time, clinical photographs will be presented at different time points to illustrate this progression. In addition to the expansion and clarification of the clinical features, grow th profile and mutational spectrum associated with KMT2A mutations, we will review the overlap with other conditions and compare the phenotype of individuals identified through non targeted screening to those individuals identified following clinician phenotyping to define the characteristic phe notype that should prompt consideration of KMT2A testing.",2015
23133,"The endothelin receptor type A (EDNRA) signaling pathway is essential for the establishment of mandibular identity during development of the first pharyngeal arch. We report four unrelated individuals with a novel syndro me, mandibulofacial dysostosis with alopecia (MFDA), who have de novo missense variants in EDNRA. The MFDA phenotype includes eyelid and ear dysplasia and hearing loss. Three of the four individuals have the same sub stitution in EDNRA, p. Tyr129Phe. Tyr129 is known to determine the selecti ve affinity of EDNRA for endothelin 1 (EDN1), its major physiological ligand, and the p. Tyr129Phe variant increases the affinity of the receptor for EDN3, its non preferred ligand, by two orders of magnitude. The fourth individual, previously described as having Johnson McMillin syndrome, has a somatic mosaic substitution in EDNRA, p. Glu303Lys. The zygomatic arch of indivi duals with MFDA resembles that of mice in which EDNRA is ectopically ac tivated in the maxillary prominence, resulting in a maxillary to mandibular transformation, suggesting that the p. Tyr129Phe variant causes an EDNRA gain of function in the developing upper jaw. Our findings highlight the im portance of finely tuned regulation of EDNRA signaling during human cra niofacial development and suggest that modification of endothelin receptor ligand specificity was a key step in the evolution of vertebrate jaws.

Many Mendelian disorders with isolated or syndromic short stature have been recognized but the spectrum of conditions with increased growth appears much more restricted. Among the latter, the 3q13.31 microdele tion (del3q13.31) syndrome is a multisystem disorder characterized by increased postnatal growth, hypotonia, intellectual disability, disturbed behavior and unusual face. Primrose syndrome is an overgrowth conditi on characterized by macrocephaly, hypotonia, intellectual disability, autism and other behavioral concerns. Facial signs resemble del3q13.31 syndrome. Individuals with Primrose syndrome also develop diabetes in adulthood, progressive muscle wasting, hearing loss and ectopic calcifications. We used a WES based strategy to identify the Primrose disease gene. We report that mutations in ZBTB20, residing within the 3q13.31 microdeletion syndrome critical region, underlie this disorder. Eight different missense mutations af fecting residues located in the N terminal region of the DNA binding domain of the transcription factor were identified. Mutations were predicted to af fect DNA binding, and biochemical data provided evidence for reduced in teraction with DNA and transactivation activity of disease causing mutants. Mutations were documented affect protein function through a dominant negative action.

Transcription factors operate in developmental processes to mediate induc tive events and cell competence, and perturbation of their function or regu lation can dramatically affect morphogenesis, organogenesis, and growth. We report that a narrow spectrum of mutations within the transactivation domain of the v maf avian musculoaponeurotic fibrosarcoma oncogene homolog (MAF), a leucine zipper containing transcription factor of the AP1 superfamily, profoundly affects development. Seven different de novo missense mutations involving conserved residues of the four GSK3 phos phorylation motifs were identified in eight unrelated individuals. The di stinctive clinical phenotype, for which we propose the eponym AymÃÂ© Gripp syndrome, is not limited to lens and eye defects as previously reported for MAF/Maf loss of function, but includes sensorineural deafness, intellectual disability, seizures, brachycephaly, distinctive flat facial appearance, skele tal anomalies, mammary gland hypoplasia, and reduced growth. Disease causing mutations impair proper MAF phosphorylation, ubiquitination and proteosomal degradation, perturb gene expression in patient fibroblasts, and induce neurodevelopmental defects in an in vivo model. Our findings nosologically and clinically delineate a previously poorly understood reco gnizable multisystem disorder, provide evidence for MAF governing a wider range of developmental programs than previously appreciated, and uncover a novel example of protein dosage effect severely perturbing development.",2015
23136,"ABSTRACTS CONCURRENT SESSIONS ESHG 2015 | GLASGOW, SCOTLAND, UK | WWW. ESHG. ORG 49Back to inde x Genome wide association studies (GWAS) have identified a large number of disease associated loci, but in few cases have the functional variant and the gene it controls been identified. To systematically identify candidate regula tory variants we sequenced ENCODE cell lines and used public ChIP seq data to find allele specific transcription factor binding. We found 15,644 candi date regulatory SNPs of which more than 20% were rare, allele frequency <1%, and showed evidence of larger functional effect than common SNPs. This high frequency of rare functional variants adds heterogeneity to GWA studies of traits and expression and may explain divergent GWAS results between populations and why SNPs with the highest association signal rare ly are functional. The majority of allele specific variants (95%) were specific to one of the six studied cell types. By examining GWAS loci we found >600 allele specific candidate SNPs, 184 of which were highly relevant in our cell types. Results were confirmed by luciferase assays, EMSA and stimulation of primary cells. Functionally validated SNPs support identification of an in tronic SNP in MERTK associated to risk for liver fibrosis, a SNP in SYNGR1 affecting risk for rheumatoid arthritis and primary biliary cirrhosis as well as a SNP in the last intron of COG6 affecting risk for psoriasis. We propose that by repeating ChIP seq experiments of 20 selected transcription factors in three to ten people most common polymorphisms can be interrogated for allele specific binding, in different cell types and tissues. Our strategy may help to alleviate the current bottle neck in functional annotation of the genome.",2015
23137,"The ultimate goal of GWASs is to find disease associated markers, preferab ly causal variants. GWASs use microarrays to interrogate tag SNPs, there fore many untyped variants need to be inferred through imputation, using the available genotyped SNPs. As demonstrated recently [Pasaniuc et al. (2014)], not only genotypes, but association summary statistics, generated by large meta analytic studies, can be imputed. We propose several improvements to state of the art summary statistic imputation tools. We compute the optimal shrinking of the SNP SNP cor relation matrix, which flexibly adapts to the reference panel size, local LD structure, region size, etc. In addition, our method allows for summary sta tistics that are dervied from variable sample sizes. Finally, we search for the optimal linear combination of reference panel sub populations in order to match their joint allele frequency distribution to that of the association stu dies. This is analogous to selecting the subset of the reference panel that best represents the individuals in the GWAS cohorts. Our extensive simulation study, using UK10K whole genome sequencing data sets, showed that our optimized shrinkage constant significantly out performs all previously proposed choices when the reference panel is small (<300). We also demonstrated the importance of ancestry weighted mixture using 1000 Genomes subpopulation panels combined with summary stati stics simulated from our local CoLaus study (Firman et al., 2008). Finally, using cohort level association summary data from the GIANT (Genetic In vestigation of ANthropometric Traits) Consortium, we found that applying ancestry matched imputation of individual cohort summary statistics before meta analysis substantially outperforms the imputation of meta analysed association summary statistics.

23138,"Recently, genome wide association studies (GWAS) have been expanded to analysis of low frequency and rare variants (MAFÃ¢ÂÂ¤5%, both denoted by RVs). Power for variant detection could also be increased by jointly analy sing multiple correlated phenotypes. We have developed software for geno me wide Multi phenotype Analysis of RVs (MARV), combining features from both RV burden tests and multi phenotype analyses. Specifically, the pro portion of rare variants at which an individual carries minor alleles within a gene region is modelled on linear combinations of phenotypes in a regres sion framework. MARV also implements model selection via the Bayesian information criterion (BIC). We have applied this new method on three cor related phenotypes: fasting insulin (FI), triglycerides (TG) and waist to hip ratio (WHR), using data from 4788 individuals from the Northern Finland Birth Cohort 1966. Individuals were genotyped on the Illumina370CNV ar ray and imputed to the 1000 Genomes Project all ancestries reference panel (March 2012). FI/TG/WHR were adjusted for body mass index and three principal components to control for population structure. The following transformations were applied: natural logarithm for FI and inverse normal for the residuals of TG and WHR. We identified RV associations, at genome wide significance (p<1.7x10 6, Bonferroni correction for 30,000 genes) in ZNF259 , which maps to a common variant GWAS locus for TG and coronary heart disease. Based on BIC, the model with TG and FI provided the best fit (Pmodel,3.1x10 9), and stronger associations than in univariate analyses (PTG,6.7x10 8; PFI,0.13).

23139,"Introduction: Whole exome sequencing has revolutionized rare disease re search. However, many cases remain unsolved due to the fact that ~100 1000 loss of function, candidates remain after removing common and non pathogenic variants. Exomiser offers a suite of algorithms that address this problem by additionally combining gene based measures of candida cy. hiPHIVE (Human Interactome PHenotypic Interpretation of Variants in Exomes) assesses each candidate gene by comparing the patient phenotype to existing knowledge from disease and model organism databases. For ge nes with missing data, a guilt by association approach is applied, based on the phenotypic similarity of near by genes in a protein protein association network. PhenIX is designed for use in a clinical diagnostic setting where only genes associated with existing Mendelian diseases are phenotypically compared with the patient signs and symptoms. ExomeWalker ranks exome candidates based on their proximity in protein protein networks to genes shown, or suspected, to be associated with the disease. Results: In benchmarking experiments with known disease mutations ad ded to unaffected exomes, both hiPHIVE and PhenIX were able to detect the causative variant as the top hit in 97% of samples. Further experiments, where knowledge of the known disease gene association was masked, revealed hiPHIVE could detect novel associations as the top hit in 87% of samples. Exomiser is freely available via download for command line use or through our web interfaces. Conclusions: We are applying Exomiser to the NIH Undiagnosed Diseases Program and detect causative variants as the top hit in most previously sol ved cases and have diagnosed several new cases including a novel associa tion.",2015

Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a genetically heterogeneous neurode generative disorder hallmarked by adult onset loss of motor neurons and fatal paralysis. Mutations in 29 genes have been linked to ALS pathogenesis and are frequently also associated with fronto temporal dementia (FTD). However, mutations in these genes explain less than 1/3 of ALS cases. To evaluate the contribution of low frequency variants in protein coding ge nes to familiar ALS, we performed exome sequencing of 252 index cases and 827 control individuals. We performed gene based rare variant analysis and identified a single exome wide significant enrichment of loss of function (LoF) mutations in the gene TANK binding kinase 1 (TBK1) in the patient group. Seven different LoF mutations were found in nine patients, whereas LoF variants were absent in controls and in 3,101 additional in house exo mes. No enrichment of LoF mutations was detected using a targeted mutation screen of 1,010 sporadic cases and 650 Swedish control individuals. Next, we recruited relatives from index mutation carriers to perform linkage analysis. Incomplete penetrance was observed in all pedigrees. Linkage ana lysis in 3 extended families using a dominant model with reduced penetran ce resulted in a summary LOD score of 4.6 thus exceeding the genome wide significance threshold. In vitro experiments including patient derived cell lines confirmed loss of expression of TBK1 LoF mutant alleles, or loss of interaction of the TBK1 coiled coil domain (CCD) with the TBK1 adaptor protein optineurin, an esta blished ALS target. In conclusion, we provide parallel evidence from association testing and lin kage analysis that LoF TBK1 variants cause a monogenic form of ALS with FTD and reduced penetrance.",2015
23142,"Non progressive cerebellar ataxias (NPCAs) are a rare group of disorders, with only 7 genes/loci described, for autosomal recessive NPCAs. NPCAs manifest in infancy with abnormal gross motor development and hypotonia, followed by the appearance of ataxia. Dysarthria, intellectual disability and spasticity are often present. We studied 17 patients from 4 families affected with NPCA, including the large Lebanese family previously described by Megarbane et al (1999) and localized to chromosome 9q34 (Delague et al, 2001; OMIM #213200). Ho mozygosity mapping and exome sequencing led to the identification of mu tations in PMPCA in all patients: a homozygous p.

Ala377Thr mutation, as patients from 3 a priori non related Lebanese families share a common haplotype at the PMPCA locus. PMPCA encodes ÃÂ± MPP , the alpha subunit of mitochondrial processing peptidase (MPP), the primary enzyme responsible for the maturation of nuclear encoded mitochondrial proteins. Analysis of cells from patients ho mozygous for the PMPCA p. Ala377Thr mutation and carriers, demonstrate that the mutation impacts both the level of ÃÂ± MPP and the function of MPP . Indeed, this mutation impacts the maturation process of frataxin, the defec tive protein in Friedreich ataxia. Our results definitely implicate PMPCA as the causal gene in this rare form of NPCA.

23143,"Spinocerebellar ataxia type 28 (SCA28) is a neurodegenerative disease caused by mutations of the AFG3L2 gene. The encoded protein assembles into multimeric complexes (the m AAA proteases), which exert protein quality control in the inner mitochondrial membrane and participate to the regulation of mitochondrial morphology. The Afg3l2 haploinsufficient mouse recapitulates the symptoms of SCA28 patients, presenting a progres sive decline in motor skills caused by dark degeneration of Purkinje cells (PC DCD) of mitochondrial origin. In this work, we define the pathogenetic mechanism of SCA28 and provide the first evidence of a pre clinical treat ment of this disease. We demonstrated in cultured PCs that an inefficient buffering of stimulus evoked Ca2+ peaks by Afg3l2 deficient mitochondria provokes an increase in cytoplasmic Ca2+ concentration, thus triggering PC DCD. Proving this mechanism, we completely recover the ataxic phenotype of SCA28 mice by genetically reducing the metabotropic glutamate recep tors mGluR1, and thus decreased Ca2+ influx in PCs. The same result has been successfully replicated by administration of an off label therapy with ceftriaxone that favors the synaptic glutamate clearance. This treatment is effective when applied at both presymptomatic and after the ataxia onset in the preclinical model, thus representing a safe and immediately accessible therapy for presymptomatic carriers of AFG3L2 mutations and also SCA28 patients with overt symptoms.",2015

We investigated 30 Amish individuals (1 28yrs) with a severe nephrocerebel lar syndrome characterised by progressive microcephaly, visual impairment, stagnant psychomotor development, abnormal extrapyramidal movements, and steroid resistant nephrosis. Post mortem neuropathology revealed mi crencephaly and atrophic cerebellar hemispheres with a unique pattern of histological findings. Assuming autosomal recessive inheritance of a founder mutation we used autozygosity mapping and next generation sequencing to identify the underlying molecular cause, a homozygous frameshift variant in WDR73 (c.888delT; p.

Interestingly, a second trunca ting frameshift variant (c.1264_1270delATAAAAG) (NM_001080435.2) was also identified in the closely linked WHAMM gene, which was found to be homozygous in all but one affected individual. A further novel homozygous frameshift variant (WDR73 c.766dupC; Arg256Profs*18) was identified in a Bulgarian child with similar clinical features. Our functional studies re vealed that wild type WDR73 protein is expressed in human cerebral cor tex, hippocampus, and cultured embryonic kidney cells and interacts with ÃÂ± and ÃÂ² tubulin, heat shock protein 90 (HSP 90), and CAD; the mTORC1 regulated multi enzyme complex.

The pedigree structure of both families suggested a recessive disorder. Whole genome autozygosity mapping and exome sequencing revealed the presence of different homozygous mutations in PDE10A. Modeling of one of the mutations in cell lines showed that there was a reduction in protein levels and abnormal localization of PDE10A to the cytosol rather than the cell membrane where it is required for its activity. We constructed a knock in mouse with one of the variants, this model animal displayed deficient motor control.

Inherited leukodystrophies represent a diagnostic challenge and many pa tients remain without a diagnosis. In this study we investigated the gene tic etiology of the recently described X linked disorder Ã¢ÂÂHypomyelination of Early Myelinating StructuresÃ¢ÂÂ (HEMS) in 16 patients diagnosed by brain MRI criteria. Using exome sequencing, we identified in all patients unusual hemizygous mutations in the PLP1 gene, located either in exon 3B (1 dele tion, 1 missense and 2 silent), which is spliced out in isoform DM20, or in intron 3 (5 mutations). The frameshift deletion led to truncation of PLP1, but not DM20. In silico analysis of effects of the mutations on splicing and secondary RNA folding showed that four mutations located deep in intron 3 were predicted to destabilize a long distance interaction structure in the se condary PLP1 RNA fragment involved in regulating PLP1 /DM20 alternative splicing. The other four mutations were predicted to alter PLP1 /DM20 al ternative splicing, either by creating exonic splicing silencers motifs, a splice donor site or by affecting the local RNA structure of the PLP1 splice donor site.

Intriguingly, in patients with HEMS, brain structures that normally myelina te early, are hypomyelinated, in contrast to Pelizaeus Merzbacher disease, also caused by PLP1 alterations. This suggests that PLP1/DM20 alternative splicing is important for early myelination, probably by an impact on the PLP1 /DM20 ratio.

Objective: In contrast to whole chromosome aneuploidy, microdeletion syn dromes are smaller and thus harder to detect, and they occur with equal fre quency in women of different maternal ages. Here we report on the clinical experience with our single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) based noninva sive prenatal test (NIPT) for the microdeletion responsible for the 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (DiGeorge). Method: 21,948 maternal blood samples received between February and August 2014 were analyzed for the 22q11.2 deletion. Cell free DNA and maternal specific DNA were isolated from the samples. 672 SNPs in a 2.91 Mb DNA segment commonly deleted in the 22q11.2 deletion syndrome were PCR amplified, sequenced, and analyzed using a proprietary algorithm to determine fetal and maternal copy number at the interrogated region. Fol low up information was sought for all high risk cases. Results: In the study cohort, 97 (0.5%) patients were found to be at high risk for a 22q11.2 microdeletion, including two cases in which the mother was suspected to have the deletion. Fetal diagnostic confirmation was avai lable for 58 high risk cases: 11 were true positives and 47 were false posi tives, resulting in a positive predictive value (PPV) of 19%. Invasive testing decisions were available for 81 high risk cases: 60.5% had invasive testing and 39.5% declined. Ultrasound abnormalities were confirmed for 81.8% of true positive and 10.6% of false positive cases. Follow up is ongoing. Conclusions: Despite the small size of the 22q11.2 microdeletion, this SNP based NIPT was highly effective and may be considered as a first line approach for the general pregnancy population, not just for high risk pati ents.",2015

XY female individuals are rarely found and have complex features. The degree of secondary sexual characteristics, level of hormone and presence or absence of MÃÂ¼llerian or gan might be shown by various causes. Materials and Methods : Cytogenetic analysis were performed in 9,472 female patients at Cheil General Hospital between September 1983 and December 2014. Clinical findings, basal hormone profiles, radiological readings were investigated. Additionally, DA DAPI staining, CBG banding, quantitative fluorescence polymerase chain reaction analysis, fluorescence in situ hybridization were conducted to confirm the presence of Y chromo some and SRY gene. Results : Among the 9,472 individuals, 14 cases found with complete 46,XY female (0.0015 %). Indications of 12 cases were primary amenorrhea (86 %) and two cases were agenesis of uterus and ovary cyst dysgeminoma re spectively. Six cases had no uterus and high levels of testosterone.

In this study, 2 families with patients whom diagnosed clinically as androgen insensitivity syndrome (AIS) were physically and genetically examined. This evaluation carried out by cytogenetic and molecular analysis including karyotype and sequencing of SRY and AR genes. In family1, two brothers and their mother were hemizygous and heterozygous respective ly for c.2522G>A variant, while one of their healthy brother was comple tely normal hemizygous. Family 2 assessment demonstrated the c.639G>A (rs6152) mutation in two siblings who were reared as girls. The SRY gene was intact in all of the studyÃ¢ÂÂs participants. Our findings in family 1 could be a further proof for the pathogenicity of the c.2522G>A variant. Given the importance of AR mutations in development of problems such as sex assign ment in AIS patients, definitive diagnosis and phenotype genotype corre lation could be achieved by molecular genetic tests that in turn could have promising impacts in clinical management and also in prenatal diagnosis of prospect offspring.grant:Tehran University of Medical Sciences/89033010820",2015

AMH levels vary broadly in women du ring reproductive life, until after 40 years old when the AMH level starts to decrease sharply, becoming undetectable after menopause. The discovery of genetic variants responsible for the high variability in AMH level could be a useful marker to predict fertility and age of menopause. AMH levels were measured in serum of 850 healthy women collected by the Italian Network of Genetic Isolates (INGI) and of 461 fertile women collec ted by Obstetrics and Gynecology Unit of San Raffaele Hospital, Milano.

Molecular confirmation is commonly performed on amniocytes and the possibility to use fresh (CVF) and cultu red (CVC) CV has never been investigated. To verify whether CVF and CVC are eligible sources of DNA, we tested by pyrosequencing in normal pregnancies the methylation percentage at: ICR1, ICR2, H19 promoter, PWS/AS ICR, MGMT and RASSF1A genes. We highligh ted stable methylation levels at the imprinting driving regions ICR1 (CVF: 45.38% ÃÂ± 1.77; CVC: 45.04% ÃÂ± 1.81), ICR2 (CVF: 44.32% ÃÂ± 1.84; CVC: 43.67% ÃÂ± 2.10) and PWS/AS ICR (CVF: 43.70% ÃÂ± 5.60; CVC, 43.15% ÃÂ± 3.41).

Almost 2,000 mutations have been described, resulting in CF and CFTR related disorders including male infertility by congenital absence of the vas deferens (CBAVD). Here, we report a Portuguese couple undergoing assisted reproduction because of CBAVD. The man was compound heterozygous for the CF mutation c.1000C>T (R334W) and the CFTR RD associated complex allele c.[1210 34TG[13]T[5];3705T>G] (TG13T5;S1235R). The genotype was consistent with the phenotype. The partner carried three heterozygous variants: c.1727G>C (G576A) and c.2002C>T (R668C), which are known as a complex allele, per se not associated with CF but sometimes in association with a third mutation, resulting in a CF or CFTR RD allele, and c.1158C>A (N386K), which was never reported previously. Family study led to cha racterize a new complex allele combining the three variants. Evaluation of a possible impact of the c.1158C>A (N386K) mutation by bioinformatic tools did not suggest an effect on splicing but showed a possible effect on the protein level. This mutation, in the context of a complex allele, was thus considered to be potentially associated with CF, although functional studies would help document such an effect. This makes genetic counseling cau tious, with a 25% hypothetical risk for the couple of having a child with CF.

The proband is otherwise healthy and has received no blood or bone marrow transfusions. Karyotype analysis of peripheral blood and subsequent FISH analysis of buccal cells showed a mixture of 46,XY and 46,XX cells. Several mechanisms have been proposed for the formation of chimerism including 1) tetragametic chimera resulting from postzygotic fu sion of two separate zygotes, 2) dispermic fertilization of either an oocyte and its second polar body, and 3) dispermic fertilization of two female ga metes arising from parthenogenetic division of a single oocyte. Comparative QF PCR studies of the proband and both parents provided evidence of a ge netic contribution in the proband from two different sperm but no evidence of a genetic contribution from a second ovum, consistent with mechanism 2 or 3.

The overall frequency of reportable non mosaic CCA was 8,5%, and in 2% of samples a CCA was only found in trophoblast. All the CCA were diagnosed in the abnormal first trimester screening group. Although the cohort presented is relatively small, it seems that CCA and placental mosaicisms of CCA present a frequency similar to that of cytoge netically visible chromosomal abnormalities during the first trimester of pregnancy.

In this study, we investigate the incidence of CIN in in vitro cleavage stage bovine embryos, and provide substantial proof that bovine early embryoge nesis is a valuable model for the study of underlying mechanisms leading to CIN in an in vivo research setting.151 blastomeres from 25 cleavage stage embryos were obtained on day 2 and day 3 post insemination (pi) and whole genome amplified (WGA). Sub sequently, the samples were hybridized on the Illumina Bovine HD Bead Chip SNP arrays. We consequently applied a modified version of the siCHILD algorithm (siCHILD bovine) and haplarithmisis for the data analysis. From 25 embryos analyzed, 7 were uniformly diploid (28%), while 18 em bryos had blastomeres with chromosomal anomalies (72%), of which 83% were mosaic. Out of 124 blastomeres available for the analysis, 31% were diploid, 47% had whole chromosome abnormalities and 27% carried seg mental aberrations. Moreover, segmental reciprocal gains and losses in si ster blastomeres were identified in 3 embryos. This study demonstrates that the nature of CIN in bovine cleavage stage and human cleavage stage embryos are comparable. Therefore, cattle can be employed as a model organism for CIN studies.

However, it is unclear weather the entire placenta or just certain placental cell types promote this phenomenon. Also it may oc cur that prevalence of CNVs in one cell type may be essential for normal development, while in another responsible for embryolethality. We aimed to investigate CNVs in the only two placental tissues available from blighted ova cytotropholast (CT) and extraembryonic mesoderm (EM).Materials and Methods: Placental tissues of 10 euploid miscarriages were investigated using Agilent 180K microarrays. Results: Altogether 198 CNVs were detected: 91 in EM and 107 in CT , 24 (26%) and 50 (47%) of them were unique respectively (p,0.0032). Micro deletions and microduplications were equally represented in EM (11 vs. 13), while microdeletions prevailed in CT (41 vs. 9). Unique microdeletions significantly more frequently were detected in CT (p,0.0014). The candida te developmentally important genes involved in tissue specific CNV in EM are PTPN18 (cell growth, differentiation), CFC1 (embryonic development), OCLN (vascular integrity), WIST1 (cell lineage determination and differen tiation), TBX10 (embryonic cell fate and organogenesis), in CT CTNNA3 (inhibitor of trophoblast invasion), PTPRR (cell growth, differentiation), TSPAN8 (cell development, growth, motility), miR 296 (angiogenesis), PCGF1 (embryogenesis).Conclusions: The presented profiling of CNVs may be the hallmark of abnor mal pregnancy, specifically blighted ova, as according to Kasak et al.

These diseases share a number of clinical fea tures and encompass a wide spectrum of severity, in particular TTD, charac terised by sulphur deficient brittle hair, short stature, intellectual disability, microcephaly, facial dysmorphism and ichthyosis. To date, there have been few reports describing foetal cases with mutations in ERCC2. Case report We describe a male foetus, the second child of healthy unrelated parents, who died in utero at 28 weeks of pregnancy. The autopsy revealed severe harmonious intrauterine growth retardation (<3rd centile), delayed bone maturation, congenital ichthyosis, and facial dysmorphism including low in sertion of the columella, beaked nose, large and low set ears, micrognathism and retrognathism and upslanted palpebral fissures.

As it is now technically feasible to screen for many more diseases, the question arises whether this population prefers an ancestry based offer or a pan ethnic expanded carrier screening panel that goes beyond the diseases relatively frequent in their own population, and is offered regardless of ancestry. Methods: An online questionnaire was completed by 145 individuals from the Dutch Jewish community (Ã¢ÂÂ¥18 years) between April and July 2014.Results: 64.8% were aware of the existence of ancestry based carrier scree ning. Respondents were generally positive about screening and thought that several categories of diseases should be included. About half (54%) prefer red pan ethnic expanded carrier screening whereas 43% preferred ance stry based screening. Reasons for preferring pan ethnic screening included Ã¢ÂÂeveryone has a right to be testedÃ¢ÂÂ, Ã¢ÂÂfear of stigmatization when offering ancestry based panelsÃ¢ÂÂ, and Ã¢ÂÂdifficulties with identifying risk due to mixed backgroundsÃ¢ÂÂ. Ã¢ÂÂPreventing high healthcare costsÃ¢ÂÂ was the main perceived barrier to pan ethnic carrier screening among those in favour of ancestry based screening. Conclusion: These findings show that people from the Dutch Jewish com munity have a positive attitude regarding carrier screening in their commu nity for a wide range of diseases. Costs were the main perceived barrier for pan ethnic carrier screening panels. As costs of these panels are most likely to drop in the near future, it may be expected that these will receive more support in the future.

Congenital anomalies affect 1% to 2% of newborns, and approximately 4 5% of those children have abnormalities of urinary tract and kidneys and 10% have upper extremity abnormalities. Combining of homozygo sity mapping using SNP arrays and sequencing of target regions has been successfully applied for identification of mutations causing many autosomal recessive diseases in patients diagnosed postnatally. We used SNP array karyotyping and next generation sequencing to cla rify the etiology of a polymalformative syndrome detected prenatally. On US scan at 18th g. w. the fetus of a second gravida was found to have: mild growth retardation, right kidney agenesis and absent radii and thumbs of both arms.

The gene FANCD2 mapped in the region and was found to be a good candidate for the fetal malformati ve syndrome. We used TruSight Cancer gene panel (Illumina) and the MySeq sequencing system. The fetus was found to be homozygous for a novel hy pomorphic mutation in FANCD2 gene: p. Leu699del and both parents were found to be carriers of the mutation. The identification of an anomaly compatible with life during pregnancy is a challenge for both prospective parents and the doctor. The anomalies re quire an accurate diagnosis and communication of relevant information to the family. Certain anomalies occur in isolation, whereas others are asso ciated with systemic conditions. Prognosis of the developing fetus and re productive decisions of the family largely depend on the causes behind the disease.",2015
23165,"Prenatal ultrasonography identifies an increasing number of undescribed malformation phenotypes. Little attention has been paid to using whole exome and genome sequencing strategies for gene identification in fetal dis orders that are lethal in utero, because they are extremely rare, may appear to be sporadic, and Mendelian inheritance can be easily missed. Some lethal phenotypes, however, indicate an error of early development implying a ma jor malfunction of a gene with a crucial role in cellular and developmental processes. Hypothesizing that truncating autosomal recessive variants are an impor tant cause of early human lethality, we select families with phenotype re currence in sibs who died during pregnancy or after birth because of their malformations. We correlate the malformation pattern, confirmed by auto psy, to developmental pathways in embryogenesis. Genes with homozygous or compound heterozygous variants will be considered candidates. Those harboring truncating variants will be prioritized, since loss of function vari ants are more likely to be causal compared to other variant classes. We present two novel prenatal malformation patterns indicative of the dis ruption of pathways involved in ciliary and midline defect phenotypes. The role in cell division of candidate genes identified suggests a link to these developmental pathways. Causality is supported by cross species phenoty ping. Identifying mutations implicated in early fetal development will improve recurrence risk counseling and allow prenatal diagnosis for future pregnan cies in affected families. Lethal fetal phenotypes may represent an impor tant model to study the genetic basis of natural human knockouts and the roles of genes for which little to nothing is known.",2015

Cells were isolated from blood samples and were subsequently cultured to obtain the targeted line of hematopoietic colonies. After the incubation period, single erythroid colonies were collected and analyzed by means of microarray technology using GeneChip Human Gene 1.0 ST Array. Results: The analysis showed statistically significant differences in the ex pression of 958 genes between maternal and fetal cells. Most of the genes (n , 591) showed higher expression in the fetus relative to the expression of the motherÃ¢ÂÂs genome. A total of 367 genes showed decreased expression in the fetus. Initial protocols were developed for culture and identification of fetal cells in the maternal blood. Conclusions: The use of cell culture enables multiplication of the cells and reduces the volume of maternal blood sample necessary for the analysis. Transcriptome analysis of cells shows expression of specific genes, which may be used as markers for the identification of fetal cells.",2015

A great success in identifying responsible genes & characterizing mutations within such genes paved the road for DNA based prenatal diagnosis. Ex amples of severe genodermatoses candidate for prenatal diagnosis include autosomal recessive congenital ichthyosis (ARCI), Xerodema pigmentosa (XPA), SjÃÂ¶gren Larsson syndrome (SLS) and papillon lefeuvre syndrome (PLS) where clinical severity affects span &/or quality of life hence urging prenatal diagnosis. Materials and methods: The study included five amniotic samples (AF) from carrier mothers descending from five pedigrees with history of affected sibs with severe genodermatoses including; two mothers of previous ARCI ca ses, one XPA, one SLS and one PLS. DNA was extracted from AF samples by QIA gene extraction kit followed by mutational screening for XPA, TGM1, ALDH3A2 and CTSC genes. Results: prenatal diagnosis was successfully performed in all cases. For the family with history of XPA, the fetus was found to be heterozygous carrier for E111X mutation; For ALDH3A2 gene the fetus was affected for E331X nonsense mutation; for TGM1 gene the two fetuses were heterozygous car riers for R264W, R143H missense mutations. The fifth AF sample PLS sho wed homozygous wild type genotype. Conclusion: The high incidence of consanguinity & consequently AR rare disorders combined with the lack of curative therapy, points to the impor tance of implementing preventive programs.

23171,"Background Hypospadias is a common congenital malformation of the male external ge nitalia with a multifactorial etiology. We identified all genetic associations reported for hypospadias and tried to replicate the most promising ones. Methods After a thorough literature search and SNP selection, we used Taqman as says to genotype seven SNPs in 816 Caucasian nonsyndromic hypospadias patients and 668 population based controls derived from the AGORA data and biobank in the Netherlands. Results When excluding studies using microarrays performed after our SNP selec tion, 36 polymorphisms in DGKK and 67 polymorphisms in 16 other genes were identified. We already examined DGKK successfully in our cohort and this gene was also associated with hypospadias in several other Caucasian populations, but much less strong in a Chinese. Many of the polymorphis ms in other genes were found not to be associated with hypospadias, had a MAF<2% in Caucasians, or were repeats or deletions, while four SNPs had already been studied in our cohort. Therefore, we selected seven SNPs in the genes HSD17B3 , ESR1 , ESR2 , ATF3 and MAMLD1 for this study. None of the SNPs was associated with hypospadias, with the possible exception of rs944050 in ESR2 (OR,1.5, p,0.045). This association was in the same di rection as in a Swedish study and in the opposite direction compared to a Japanese study.

23172,"Introduction: Genetic causes of male infertility are hypothesized to involve multiple types of mutations, from single gene defects to complex chromoso me rearrangements. Recently, several recurrent X chromosome microdele tions (located in subtelomeric region of the long arm) were reported to be associated with male infertility in Spanish and Italian males (Lo Giacco et al., 2014). The aim of our study was to test their prevalence and infertility association in population of men from the Czech Republic. Materials and Methods: 146 males with idiopathic nonobstructive infertility were compared to 109 males with normal fecundity. X chormosome micro deletions were assessed by +/ PCR with three primer pairs for each region Xcnv64 (Xq27.3), Xcnv67 (Xq28) and Xcnv69 (Xq28). The latter microdele tion was also complemented with amplification across the deleted region, dividing the deletion into three types. Results: We detected presence of Xcnv64 in 10 patients and 12 controls, Xcnv69 in 5 patients and 4 controls (3, 1 and 1 patient vs. 3, 1 and 0 control for types A, B and C respectively). Thus the frequency was comparable in patient and control groups (FisherÃÂ´s exact test P>>0.05). The patient with Xcnv69 type C deletion also carries Xcnv64 deletion. This may indicate a more extensive rearrangement with putative causal potential. Conclusion: Association of X chromosome microdeletions at Xq27.3 and Xq28 with male infertility could not be confirmed for Czech males.

Let 7c miRNA is located on the human chromosome 21 and broadly expressed by the major types of cardiovascular cells. Recent studies revealed the possible role of let 7c in heart development; therefore we hypothesize that it can be associated with CHD.

23177,"Background: Non invasive prenatal testing (NIPT) demonstrated a small chance for a false positive and false negative result. This is partly due to the fact that the fetal DNA in maternal plasma is derived from the cytotropho blast of chorionic villi (CV). This cytotrophoblast is not always represen tative for the fetus because of its embryonic origin (trophoblast) and the existence of chromosomal mosaicism. Therefore, accurate cytogenetic stu dies in CV involve the investigation of both cytotrophoblast (STC villi) and mesenchymal core, the latter having the same embryonic origin as the fetus itself. We calculated the risk for a false negative trisomy 13, 18 and 21 NIPT result of a biological nature based on our experience with CV.

Methods: Maternal blood samples submitted to Sequenom Laboratories were subjected to DNA extraction and library preparation followed by who le genome massively parallel sequencing. Sequencing data were analyzed using an algorithm to detect subchromosomal events such as 22q11 micro deletions. Results: The MaterniT21ÃÂ® PLUS test identified 32 cases with a 22q11 deletion. For twenty one cases diagnostic invasive testing was per formed and for all cases the 22q11 deletion was confirmed. Eleven cases did not have invasive testing results available. Seven of these cases had clinical findings of complex heart defects or Tetralogy of Fallot consistent with the NIPT result. For the remaining four cases, no clinical signs were identified and outcomes were pending. Thus far no confirmed false positives have been identified. One of the confirmed cases was a twin gestation where one twin was positive for the 22q deletion. Conclusion: It is imperative when testing for rare conditions that tests per form with the utmost specificity to yield high positive predictive values. By using a whole genome sequencing approach, we have demonstrated that this objective is achievable. This abstract provides further evidence to broadenthe scope of non invasive testing to detect subchromosomal deletion/dupli cation events and the potential to derive fetal karyotypes in the future.",2015

All (26/26) aneuploidy pregnancy samples were detec ted; 15.4% (4/26) had a FF of 2 4%, none were <2%. Of 1056 euploid male samples, 23 (2.2%) had a FF <2% and 64 (6.1%) had a FF between 2 4%. All NIPT data were concordant. Our MPS based NIPT detected aneuploidies down to 2% FF; 6% of samples had a FF in the 2 4% range. Assay LOD should be determined prior to clini cal application, as this establishes an appropriate cut off that lowers the risk of false negative results and avoids unnecessary test cancellations.",2015

Introduction: RhD blood group incompatibility between an RhD negative mother and an RhD positive fetus followed by allosensitization and pro duction of maternal anti D antibodies is still the major reason for hemolytic disease of the fetus and newborn (HDFN). Routine antenatal and postnatal anti D prophylaxis has reduced the risk of RhD alloimmunization to 0.05 0.4%. However about 10 20% of RhD negative mothers would receive un necessary prophylaxis. Non invasive diagnostic methods employing cell free fetal DNA (cffDNA) from maternal blood overcome the risks associated with invasive procedures used for fetal RHD genotyping. Materials and Methods: We aimed to evaluate the results from non invasive fetal RHD typing using cffDNA from maternal plasma in a group of 24 RhD negative women with confirmed singleton pregnancy before receiving their first prophylactic dose of anti RhD IgG. RHD genotyping was done using real time PCR amplification of exon 5 and 7 of RHD gene. Results: Of the 24 RhD negative pregnant women 5 (20.8%) were in the first trimester (7ÃÂ±2 GW) and 19 (79.1%) were in their second trimester (20.4ÃÂ±2.6 GW). 20.8% (5/24) were in their third pregnancy and in the second trime ster. Non invasive fetal RhD typing showed that 20.8% (5/24) of the fetuses were RHD negative. Three of them were in the second trimester and 2 in the first trimester, but to mothers in their second and third pregnancy. Conclusions: These results although limited, clearly show that non invasive fetal RhD typing using cffDNA from maternal plasma can be used as a me thod in clinical practice for targeted anti RhD prophylaxis and improvement of management of RHD fetomaternal incompatibility.",2015

Here we report on the preferences and experiences of high risk pregnant women who were offered a choice between NIPT , invasive testing or no follow up test. Methods: A nationwide prospective cohort study among pregnant women at high risk for fetal aneuploidy because of first trimester screening re sults (risk >1:200) or medical history. Questionnaires were completed after counselling (n,1,106, 86% response) and after test results (n,686, 67% response), at seven (of the eight) prenatal diagnostic centres. Results: The majority of respondents (92%) preferred NIPT , 5% invasive testing, 2% were unsure, and 1% declined testing. Main reason to prefer NIPT was safety for the child (92%). Of the 60 women preferring invasive testing, 52% did so because of test accuracy, 25% desired more rapid test results, 5% because it provides more information, and 18% reported other reasons. Most women (92%) felt that they made a well informed decision, and 75% reported that this decision was easy to make. Intention to termi nate the pregnancy for Down syndrome was lower among women choosing NIPT (58%) vs. invasive testing (87%). Women were highly satisfied with NIPT . However, 64% perceived the waiting time for NIPT results (mean:11 days (range 5 32)) as too long, while 3% in retrospect would have preferred a different follow up test, mostly to avoid the long waiting time. Conclusion: Most pregnant women felt they could make an informed deci sion. The majority prefers NIPT , mainly because it has no miscarriage risk. Reducing turnaround time for test results is our next challenge in meeting womenÃ¢ÂÂs needs.",2015

Chorionic villus sampling or amniocentesis are highly precision but carry a risk of 1 3% of cases procedure related miscarriage. Non invasive prenatal testing is active ly put into practice after discovered fetal cell free DNA in maternal blood. Objective: To evaluate the possibility of using non invasive prenatal testing of aneuploidy by means of next generation sequencing (NGS) in high risk pregnancies of chromosomal fetal abnormalities. Materials and Methods: Chorionic villus sampling or amniocentesis was done on 200 pregnant wo men at 11 14 (n,165) or 17 20 (n,35) weeks of gestation due to abnormal maternal serum screening, increase in nuchal translucency and advanced maternal age. Pregnant women also donate blood samples before having the invasive test. NIPT samples were analyzed using low coverage whole geno me sequencing of plasma cell free DNA. Z score was used for fetal aneuplo idy detection and the results were validated by karyotyping confirmation. Results: Aneuploidies were confirmed in 17 of 17 T21 positive cases, 8 of 8 T18 positive cases, and 1 of 2 T13 positive cases. 2 false negative cases were identified, both T21 cases, and 1 false positive case T13. The principal factor contributing to NIPT false positive result was placental mosaicism, whereas false negative results were due to low fetal fraction (<4%). Conclusions: At this time, NIPT may be an option for women classified as high risk of aneuploidy, especially in pregnant women with advanced age. Additional studies are needed to introduce NIPT into the routine workflow of prenatal care.",2015

23187,", San Diego, CA, United States. Current clinical laboratory offerings for noninvasive prenatal testing (NIPT) determine the presence or absence of fetal aneuploidies using aligned sequence read counting methods or by leveraging single nucleotide poly morphisms (SNPs). We hypothesized that using the relative abundance of paired homologous regions may enable an alternative way to detect fetal aneuploidies noninvasively. This study describes the evaluation of paired homologous regions for the detection of trisomy 21 (T21) and trisomy 18 (T18). Assays for 1,060 amplification targets were designed to determine fetal aneuploidy status, fetal sex, and the proportion of fetal DNA present in a sample. Circulating cell free (ccf) DNA was extracted from the plasma of pregnant female donors and all target regions were co amplified in a single reaction. Amplified products were evaluated using massively parallel se quencing (Illumina) and homolog ratios were determined based on the read depth from each homolog. We measured the performance of the developed assay in a blinded set of 480 ccfDNA samples with fetal genotypes ortho gonally validated by the MaterniT21ÃÂ® PLUS Laboratory Developed Test. Samples were sequenced at a mean depth of 2.3 million reads per sample with 432 (90%) assayed samples returning a result. Using orthogonal NIPT results as a reference for each individual, we detected 31/31 T21 samples and 14/16 T18 samples. No false positive results were observed. This stu dy introduces a novel NIPT aneuploidy detection approach using targeted sequencing of paired homologous regions and establishes proof of concept for a low cost, highly scalable method for the identification of selected fetal aneuploidies with performance and non reportable rates similar to some other published methods.",2015
23188,"In the human fetus sex chromosome aneuploidies (SCA) have the same pre valence as the common autosomal aneuploidies 21, 18, 13. Non invasive prenatal testing (NIPT) of cell free fetal DNA (cffDNA) for fetal aneuploidy risk assessment has been shown to be both highly sensitive and highly spe cific for trisomy 21. However, it is less sensitive for trisomies 18, 13 and sex chromosome aneuploidies. Discrepancies between positive NIPT result and fetal karyotype on chorionic villus sampling or amniocentesis may oc cur. The source of aneuploidy may be due to maternal mosaicism, maternal malignancy, true fetal mosaicism, a demised co twin, an anembryonic sac, confined placental mosaicism. We present two cases of a 31 year old woman, pregnant in 18 gestational weeks and a 34 year old woman, also pregnant in 18 gestational weeks. Both were referred to our Unit for amniocentesis due to positive NIPT for SCA: risk for monosomy X, for the first patient and risk for KleinfelterÃ¢ÂÂs syn drome for the second. The ultrasound scans were unremarkable. DNA was extracted from uncultured amniocytes, amplified with commercial QF PCR kit and analyzed on ABI 3130. Karyotyping was performed on cultu red amniocytes using standard protocol. QF PCR and cytogenetic analysis showed normal results, SCA were exclu ded. Both pregnancies were still ongoing, with no pathological findings on fetal morphology ultrasound scans. Cytogenetic and molecular genetic analyses are to be done after delivery to reveal the source of the discordant results.

For 2 cases, the result was positive for trisomy 21.Classically, fetal DNA testing is not a good option in case of ultrasonic mal formations. For all these women, we granted the request for specific rea sons: refusal of patients to perform an invasive procedure due to the risk of induced miscarriages, risk of premature delivery or history of premature labor, decision to continue the pregnancy whatever the outcome, assisted procreation history. Genetic counseling is mandatory before testing. Test limitations were explained. Ultrasound evaluation in our unit was also per formed. Clinical evaluation of newborns and follow up were always practi ced after birth. In some specific situations, NIPT can be performed after genetic counseling and explanation of its limitations.

A 2 year old Thai boy was born from non consanguineous parents, developed dystonia and neurological deterioration after the age of 1 and died within 1 year after establishing clinical diagnosis. DNA sequencing of PANK2 in the patientÃ¢ÂÂs leukocytes revealed novel homo zygous g.21738G>C, whereas the parents were identified as carriers. Genetic counseling for PGD was performed to the couples and the ethical clearance was done. In Vitro fertilization (IVF) and Intra Cytoplasmic Sperm Injection (ICSI) with PGD was performed. All of embryos were biopsied in the clea vage stage and subsequently performed for whole genome amplification. Genetic status was diagnosed with the linkage analysis using family specific short tandem repeat markers and direct mutation testing using SNaPSHOT Mini sequencing. The aneuploidy screening was performed by Next Gene ration Sequencing based strategy. There were seven embryos from these couples: two likely affected, three likely carriers, one likely unaffected and one failed in the target genome amplification. Aneuploidy screening was done before making decision of embryo transfer and only one unaffected embryo passed the screening. Thereafter, this embryo was transferred in frozen thawed cycle and the pregnancy was successful. The confirmation was done by amniocentesis, which showed the consistent result to PGD.

23191,"Objective: To evaluate the performance of a clinical algorithm for direct ge netic analysis done on fetal/neonatal tissue. Methods: Study samples consisted of tissues obtained from miscarriage, stillbirth and neonatal demise during the time period from July 1st, 2011 to June 30th, 2014. QF PCR analysis was the initial test performed on all specimens followed by chromosomal microarray analysis done on the nor mal QF PCR specimens. Results: A total of 1071 of 1195 submitted specimens were confirmed as of true fetal origin. Of those 1071 informative specimens, 30.8% yielded ab normal results. Of the latter, 57.6% had abnormal QF PCR and 42.1% had abnormal microarray result. Autosomal trisomies were detected in 61.2%, 7.6% had triploidy, 9.1% had monosomy X, 1.5% had sex chromosome aneu somies, 5.8% were molar pregnancies and 14.2% had copy number variants (CNV) including microdeletions/microduplications and cryptic unbalanced rearrangements (Table 1). The highest diagnostic yield was observed in the 1st trimester specimens 67.9%, followed by 20.3% in the 2nd and 9.2% in the 3rd trimester. We confirmed that maternal age is correlated with the likelihood of autosomal trisomies but not with triploidy, sex chromosome aneusomies, molar pregnancy, or CNVs. Conclusion: This algorithm, based on uncultured specimens, has replaced standard cytogenetic analysis method in testing of perinatal samples and resulted in a substantially higher diagnostic yield and improved diagnostic rate. Establishing the cause of a miscarriage and stillbirth has clinical and reproductive implications and results in changes in the management of fu ture pregnancies, such as the decision to undertake preimplantation genetic testing.",2015
23192,"Introduction It is widely accepted that a main cause for IVF failure is an euploidity of the embryos. It is also claimed that normal morphokinetics of early embryos, as demonstrated by the EmbryoScope, are correlated with normal chromosomal constitution. Introducing CMA technique to the IVF lab is aimed to contribute a reliable and objective test for the selection of embryo with the best prognosis. This may enable the transfer of a single embryo without decreasing pregnancy rates. Aim To assess the additive prediction value of CMA for embryo selection, compare to the known morphokinetic parameters. Material and methods For CMA analysis 21 PGD embryos, that were not sui table for transfer, were re biopsied on day 5 6. Single cells were subjected to whole genome amplification followed by array hybridization (BlueGenome, 24 sure+) and scanning. CMA results were compared with morphokinetic parameter: PB localization, timing and synchronization of cells division and EmbryScopeÃ¢ÂÂs score. Results CMA results of 21 analyzed embryos were divided into 5 groups: normal chromosomal constitution (3), X monosomy (2), unbalanced trans location (6), single trisomy (3) and chaotic chromosomal constitution (7). Two out of 3 normal euploid embryos were graded with very low morpho kinetic score and 7 embryos with chaotic chromosomal constitution were graded with various scores. Conclusion This preliminary study demonstrates that the ploidity of cleava ge stage embryos can still be determined only by an invasive CMA method. We suggest that timing and synchrony of cell cycles are probably dissatisfac tory morphokinetic parameters for predicting embryo chromosomal consti tution; however, other parameters may be better ones.",2015

Our aim is to join the both methods together for routine examination and to increase probability to transfer healthy embryos without chromosomal aneuploidies and unaffected alleles of monogenic disease from parents. The products derived from MDA of the embryos five days of age were sub jected to the PGD analysis and sequenced in the next step using Ion Proton Sequencing machine and Ion Fragment Library Kit. From June 2014 we have analysed twenty one families undergoing the PGD of monogenic diseases with the aneuploidy detection using the NGS se quencing. Till now the total number of biopsied embryos has been sixty six; forty three embryos have been concluded as suitable for the transfer after the PGD but this number of embryos was decreased to thirty one by the re asons of the NGS results. Twelve embryos were eliminated after NGS : one triploid embryo , one embryo with trisomy of chromosome 21, two embryos with monosomy of chromosome 4, two embryos with monosomy of chro mosome 16, two embryos with trisomy of chromosome 16, one embryo with monosomy of chromosome 18 in mosaic form and two chaotic embryos.

23194,"Introduction: Preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) for chromosomal rearrangements is widely used to avoid transferring embryos with genomic aberrations. Currently, genomic microarrays are predominantly used for the detection of unbalanced structural abnormalities and aneuploidies in embryos from parents at risk. In this study we evaluate whether massive parallel sequencing (MPS) can be used in PGD for detecting chromosomal abnormalities. Materials and Methods: 15 patients with a balanced structural rearrange ment were included in the study: 8 reciprocal translocations, 4 Robertso nian translocations, 2 inversions and one insertional translocation. Whole genome amplification and microarray analysis (24sure+, Illumina) was performed on 47 trophectoderm samples from the cohort. In the current study, low coverage MPS on a Nextseq 500 (Illumina) and Ion Proton (Life Technologies) instrument was performed in parallel for those 47 amplified samples. Aberrations were detected using the QDNAseq algorithm. Results: An average read count per sample of 11 and 10 million was ob tained on the Nextseq 500 and the Ion Proton instrument respectively. In total, 6 normal and 41 abnormal embryos were analysed. All aberrations previously detected with arrayCGH could be readily detected in the MPS data and were correctly identified. The smallest detected abnormality was a 5 Mb deletion/duplication hence equaling or even exceeding the resolution of the routinely used microarrays. Conclusions: This study demonstrates that MPS on a Nextseq 500 or Ion Proton instrument can be applied for the detection of chromosomal abnor malities in PGD embryos. MPS can serve as a more cost effective and flexible technology for PGD.",2015
23195,"Placenta is a temporary, but an indispensable organ in human pregnancy. Similarly to cancer, it is characterized by highly invasive nature facilitating effective implantation of the embryo and its function to support fetal nu trition, growth and development. Rapid multiplication and invasiveness of cancerous cells is facilitated by rearrangements in their genomes. So far only cancerous tissues have been described with high profile of somatic copy number variations (CNVs).We hypothesized that similarly to cancer, somatic genomic rearrangements are promoted to support placental function. We report for the first time an extensive load of somatic CNVs, especially duplications, in the human pla cental genomes across gestation and suggest that this phenomenon may be critical for placental development and function to guarantee the normal pro gression of pregnancy. Identified placental somatic CNVs were significantly enriched in genes involved in cell adhesion, immunity, development, cell cycle. Overrepresentation of imprinted genes in somatic duplications sugge sted that amplified gene copies may represent an alternative mechanism to support parent of origin specific gene expression. The discovery may have clinical implications as placentas from pregnancy complications exhibited altered CNV profiles. Also, in prenatal testing based on cell free DNA shed into the maternal circulation by the placenta, extensive placental somatic CNVs and mosaicism may interfere with the reliable detection of fetal CNV profile.

Paired end sequencing, alignment with BWA, and variant calling using GATK. Results: Mean coverage: 308,76X (SD,62,62). Regions with >20X coverage: 99,53% (SD,0,22).Pathogenic variants (PV) and likely pathogenic variants (LPV) per donor: 2,04 (SD,1,50). Variants of uncertain clinical significance (VUCS) per donor: 6,69 (SD,2,44).Thirty nine donors presented at least 1 PV/LPV. All of them presented VUCS. Most PV/LPV were found in: CFTR (12 donors), CYP21A2 (10), BTD (7), PCCB (5), DUOX2 (4), SLC12A3 (4), POMGNT1 (4), PAH (3). Most of CFTR PV/LPV were low penetrance variants or associated to non classical phenotype. High rate of CYP21A2 PV/PPV could be due to co capture of pseudogene and false positive calls because of the methodology employed. BTD variants obtained were associated with mild phenotype, consistent with population allele frequencies described. Conclusions:Taking together all these results, some aspects should be considered: the need to fully analyze CFTR and to confirm the results with gold standard methodology for genes with pseudogenes or high homology sequences, wh ether or not to analyze genes associated to mild phenotypes, and the high number of VUCS obtained.",2015
23198,"Background: Pregnancy losses (PL) in 60% to 80% of the cases are asso ciated with chromosomal abnormalities in embryos or fetuses. Immunolo gic factors contribute to PL especially at the early stages of gestation. In par ticular, 45% of cases of the early pregnancy losses (EPL) are accompanied by immunologic intolerance to the fetus. One of the main factors involved in immune responses is the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) encoded by human leukocyte antigen (HLA) gene locus. Aims: The determination of chromosomal abnormalities in samples from EPL and allelic polymorphism of HLA DRB1 and DQA1 genes in couples with RM. Methods: Banding cytogenetic analysis; interphase mFISH analysis with the probe panel for chromosomes 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 21, 22, X and Y; DNA extraction by salting method, PCR, agarose gel electrophoresis. Results: Cytogenetic and molecular cytogenetic investigations of EPL ma terial identified karyotype anomalies in 32.4% of cases with prevalence of autosomal trisomy 42.65%, triploidy 30.38% and monosomy X 19.11%. Complex analysis of frequency and distribution of allelic variants of genes HLA DRB1 and HLA DQA1 allowed to establish alleles DRB1*0301, DRB1*1101 1104 and DQA1*0501 to be aggressor alleles in women with RPL. The cumulative homology of allelic polymorphism of more than 50% of HLA DRB1 and HLA DQA1 loci between partners increases the risk of RPL by almost four times.

The range of tests offered includes QF PCR, subtelomere MLPA, karyotyping and array CGH. Combinations of these tests are also being used to investigate later gestation pregnancy losses and fetal losses where phenotypic anomalies have been noted. The ACGS scientific subcommittee has instigated an audit of the outcomes of these tests with respect to gestational age and the presence or absence of fetal anomalies. The data is being used to examine the clinical utility of this testing in i) providing a likely cause for the pregnancy loss, ii) identifying couples with a balanced rearrangement where there is a risk of recurrence, iii) identifying which couples may benefit from prenatal genetic testing or PGD, and iv) establishing the proportion of cases where there is substantial risk of a future affected live born child. Outcomes have been measured in terms of failure rates, diagnostic yield and the significance of genetic fin dings to the management of future pregnancies for couples.

Introduction: Preimplantation Genetic Diagnosis/Screening (PGD/PGS) is the earliest form of prenatal diagnosis and allows identification of genetic abnormalities in embryos produced in vitro, prior to their transfer into the uterus. The identification and transfer of embryos with normal set of chromosomes allow to increase the implant rate per transfer and significantly reduce the likelihood of miscarriage. Materials and Methods: Array CGH is performed on trophectoderm cells. The biopsy of blastocyst during the fifth or sixth day of culture, ensures a remarkable accuracy of the results of the genetic analysis, a significant re duction in the risk of mosaicism, and the absence of impairment in regular embryonic development. Results: During the last year 690 embryos were processed from ICSI cycles performed on 313 infertile couples. In 11% of cases there werenÃ¢ÂÂt clear re sults due to detection of DNA fragmentation or low concentration of DNA. There was a result in 91% of embryos analyzed. Of these: 63% were found to be normal; 37% were found with chromosomal abnormalities. The pregnancy rate obtained by the transfer of embryos undergoing PGD, resulted to be free of chromosomal abnormalities, was 14.6% higher, com pared to the transfer of embryos without PGD. Conclusions: The intention of the PGD/PGS is to improve live births rates after IVF treatment. PGD/PGS offers one more chance during IVF treatment to increase the selection of embryos for certain groups of patients, including those with advanced maternal age, repeated failure of IVF cycles, repea ted miscarriages in parents with normal karyotype or carriers of balanced translocations.",2015

Background: One of the frequent reasons of the unsuccessful conception is the premature ovarian failure/primary ovarian insufficiency (POF/POI) that is defined as the loss of functional follicles below the age of 40 years, and the incidence of this abnormality is 0.1% among the 30 40 years age group. Among the genetic causes the most common one involves the X chro mosome, as in Turner syndrome, partial X deletion and X autosome trans locations. Methods: Here we report a case of a woman referred to genetic counsel ling because of POF. Genetic testing of the 27 year old female patient was carried out due to suspected POF/POI. Molecular and cytogenetic analyses were performed. We evaluated the FMR1 gene analysis using Southern blot technique and Primed PCR. We performed the FISH method and the stan dard cytogenetic analyses by G banding also. In order to detect the exact breakpoints, we used a special cytogenetic array ISCA plus CGH array. Results: We detected a large 67.355 Mb size deletion on the X chromosome at the critical region (ChrX q21.31 q28) which is associated with the POF/POI phenotype. At this region the concerned genes were those ones that the different studies published as POF/POI associated (POF1B; BHLHB9; DACH2; DIAPH2, FMR1; FMR2; XPNPEP2; PGRMC1, CENP1, BCORL1).Conclusions: We conclude that the karyotyping is definitely helpful in the evaluation of POF patients to identify the non submicroscopic chromosomal rearrangement, and using the array CGH technique we can contribute to the most efficient detection and mapping of exact deletion breakpoints of the deleted Xq region.",2015
23203,"ObjectivesSince 2013, samples for prenatal diagnosis in Belgium are analysed by Chro mosomal Microarray Analysis. Interpretation of prenatal copy number va riants (CNV) remains difficult given the limited phenotypic information. An Ad Hoc Committee tries to resolve uncertain cases based on literature and experiences with similar variants. A Belgian MicroArray Prenatal (BEMAP RE) database studies the association between laboratory, ultrasound and postnatal data. Method Our database was customised in consultation with the Centers for Medical Genetics to import, consult and extract genotype phenotype data. Prenatal cases in which a pathogenic CNV/UV(unclassified variant) >400kb was de tected, are imported. Phenotypic data are added postpartum and at the age of 2 3 years. Meta analysis is performed based on genotype phenotype data from hundreds of cases. Results Reporting policy is determined by classification of CNVs (benign, UV and pathogenic). If UVs have intragenic deletions/duplications in a known gene; are mentioned in literature and/or databases; consist of deletions/duplica tions covering more than 18 genes or comprise an X linked gene in a XY fe tus, likeliness of pathogenicity is evaluated. In case of strong arguments for pathogenicity, parents are tested. They are reported if parental phenotype is potentially divergent or if de novo. Known pathogenic variants, risk factors with high penetrance or ultrasound anomalies and actionable incidental fin dings are reported. Since 2013, 7875 arrays were performed; 293 (3.72 %) were reported as pathogenic. ConclusionsThe BEMAPRE database is a source of scientific, clinical and ethical studies; allows easy communication among Belgian genetic centers and will be made available to other scientists. Most recent data are presented.",2015
23204,"Prenatal testing by CMA has been established in the West Midlands Regio nal Genetics Laboratory (WMRGL) at Birmingham WomenÃ¢ÂÂs Hospital (BWH) since 2009 via involvement in a local project (243 referrals) and the MRC funded EACH project (125 referrals), with cytogenetic analysis performed concurrently on all samples tested as a stipulation of project criteriaFrom October 2014, all patients in the West Midlands presenting with abnormal ultrasound scan (USS) findings and/or an NT measurement of >3.5mm have been offered CMA instead of karyotyping, following exclusion of common aneuploidy by QF PCR. To date >200 CMA analyses have been performed using the ISCA v2.0 8x60k platform. Only CNVs interpreted to be clearly linked to USS findings or CNVs which are determined to be clearly pathogenic, irrespective of USS, are reported. Gene content and evidence of overlapping CNVs/syndromes in the literature are the main criteria used to assign pathogenicity classifications. Abnormality rate for reportable anomalies is 9.6%. CNVs considered to be sub microsco pic (likely to be undetected by karyotyping) were observed in 4.9% of refer rals, consistent with larger published studies. Decisions regarding clinical reporting and assignment of pathogenicity re main challenging in the current absence of a National UK consensus and within the fast turn around times mandated in the prenatal setting. A local review panel including both Consultant Clinical Scientists and Consultant Clinical Geneticists is therefore convened virtually to support clinical re porting. Several complex cases highlighting the need for this approach will be discussed, as will issues encountered in rolling out array based testing across the whole West Midlands.",2015

However, the chromosome 18 markers, D18S978 and D18S390, were trisomic and there was marked skewing of D18S391 towards the trisomic range. However, the centomeric marker D18S1002 gave a normal result. Fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH) studies using the chromosome 18 centromeric probe showed two signals with no evidence of mosaicism. To gether, the QF PCR and FISH findings were suggestive of a mosaic, structu rally abnormal chromosome 18. The QF PCR result for chromosome 18 was reported as being uninterpretable. Subsequent cytogenetic analysis identified a mosaic, structurally abnormal chromosome 18 in 26% of cells examined. The complex nature of the im balance could not be fully characterised by G banding. FISH studies with a wcp18 showed that no other chromosome was involved in the rearrange ment and 18p and 18q subtelomeric probes showed that there was both loss of 18q and gain of 18p material. Array CGH was used to further characterise the abnormality. The parental karyotypes were normal indicating that the abnormality had arisen de novo in the fetus. Such cases present counselling dilemmas in terms of the uncertainty in predicting the level and distribution of abnormal cells in the fetus.",2015
23206,"Non invasive versus invasive prenatal diagnosis: What do pregnant couples choose? Background: Women at increased risk of common trisomies can opt eit her for non invasive prenatal testing (NIPT) or invasive prenatal diagnosis (PND) using a SNP array at 0.5 Mb resolution. Array detects more clinically relevant anomalies, and anomalies with variable penetrance and expressi on, while NIPT only aims to detect trisomy 13, 18 and 21.Research questions: What do pregnant couples with an abnormal first trimester screening result choose: NIPT or array? Which motivations do pregnant couples have for this choice? Method: Pregnant women (N,183) and 59 of their partners participated after they were counselled by an obstetrician. Individually, women and their partners filled out a questionnaire assessing anxiety, ambivalence and infor med choice, that was previously designed and published. Results: Eighty four percent of the women chose NIPT and 16% chose array. The main reason for choosing NIPT was to prevent the risk of a miscarriage and not wanting to test for Ã¢ÂÂmore than necessaryÃ¢ÂÂ. Women who opted for an array were inclined to obtain more genetic information to be Ã¢ÂÂprepared for the futureÃ¢ÂÂ, and to mobilise adequate care if needed. Most mentioned they preferred a quicker test result that was completely certain. Conclusion: While most participants chose NIPT over invasive PND with array, our study shows that for a significant number of pregnant women and their partners, the opportunity to learn more about the health of their un born child might outweigh the miscarriage risk of an invasive procedure. It therefore seems justified to keep offering this choice.",2015

The WRGL received 86, 80 and 91 prenatal referrals for speci fic molecular tests in 2012, 2013 and 2014 respectively. There was a slight excess (55%) of amniotic fluid compared to CVS. The tests most frequently requested were DGV (n,51), sequencing (49 referrals for 34 different genes), UPD (n,39), CF (n,38), and skeletal dysplasia (n,29).Across all referrals, 49/257 results were abnormal. However, pick up was 0/21 for cases with an apparently de novo mutation in a previous pregnan cy, 15/46 for recessive conditions and 21/47 for dominant and X linked con ditions. Of 139 referrals with an Ã¢ÂÂintermediateÃ¢ÂÂ risk, 11 were affected: this category mainly comprised abnormal scans (9/101) and inherited Robert sonian translocations (0/32).Abnormal scans accounted for 42% of all referrals, increasing from 34% in 2012 to 45% in 2014; pick up rate also increased from 0/29 in 2012 to 2/31 in 2013 and 7/41 in 2014. The most common tests indicated by an abnormal scan were DGV (n,47), skeletal dysplasia (n,26) and CF (n,20). Five DGV referrals were affected, three with skeletal dysplasia and one with BWS. There were no positive CF cases referred with echogenic bowel. AF comprised the majority of abnormal scan referrals (88%) in contrast most cases referred through family history were received as CVS (68%).Additional referrals from abnormal scans, technological advances and in creases in the number of genetic tests available are all likely to affect the future delivery of prenatal genetic testing.",2015

To explore the modifier mechanism of PROK1 V67I, we studies for functional compa rison in gene expression level and cell functions of V67I and its wild type (WT) in transiently transfected cells. Material and Methods: We investigated transcript expression of V67I and WT in HTR 8/SV neo and HEK293 cells using quantitative RT PCR, and pro tein levels of cell lysate and supernatant of culture medium in HTR 8/SV neo, JAR and Ishikawa and HEK293 cells using ELISA method. Transient ly V67I or WT transfected HTR 8/SV neo and HEK293 cells were used to evaluate cell proliferation, cell invasion, tubal formation, and intracellular calcium mobilization. Results: The gene expression level of both transcript and protein were down regulated in all cell lines, ranging from 20% to 70% compared with WT . The ligand activities of V67I and WT on cell proliferation, cell invasion, calcium influx and tubal formation were of no difference. Both PROK1 allele promo ted cell invasion and induced intracellular calcium influx activities, whereas they have no significant effect on cell proliferation, and tubal formation. In conclusion, the common variant of PROK1 (V67I) may play as a modifier in PROK1 PROKR system through down regulation of PROK1 expression. Our investigation may provide a general modification mechanism for impact on disease severity of PROK1 related pathophysiology.",2015

Prevention, ear ly detection, and specific treatment of preeclampsia are hindered by the fact that the etiology has remained unknown. Current consensus implicates pla cental and endothelial dysfunction, inflammation and genetics in develop ment of preeclampsia. Our prior genome wide transcriptional profiling of placental tissue led to a novel set of 63 preeclampsia candidate genes. In this report, we present preliminary study on the role of regulatory sites in some of these genes in the genetic susceptibility to preeclampsia. We analyzed 48 regulatory SNPs (rSNPs) in 23 differentially expressed genes in 519 patients with preeclampsia and 718 women with uncomplicated pregnancies from Russian, Buryat and Yakut populations using MassArray iPLEX (Sequenom). We have detected significant associations for preeclampsia with 15 rSNPs in 11 genes (CORO2A, NDRG1, SASH1, BHLHE40, PLIN2, SYDE1, LHB, HK2, INHA, ZNF175, PPP1R12C). These genes were associated with such biolo gical processes as synthesis and functional activity of hormones, protein binding, ligand receptor interaction and binding with DNA. Interestingly, only one gene (CORO2A) has been associated with preeclampsia in all three populations. These results demonstrate a significant role of genetic variabi lity of the differentially expressed genes regulatory sites in the formation of susceptibility to pre eclampsia in different ethnic groups.

The etiology of the disease is currently unknown on the other hand it is believed that autosomal gene defects could lead to SCOs. The aim of this study is detecting autosomal genetic defects and determining candidate genes in SCOs infertile men. Single nucleotide polymorphism + comparative genomic hybridization microarray technology (SNP+CGH ar ray) was performed on 39 SCOs infertile patients in the study. Array CGH compares the patientÃ¢ÂÂs genome against a reference genome and identifies uncover deletions, amplifications, ploidy abnormalities and loss of heterozy gosity (LOH).

Autosomal aneuploidies cause serious malformations like triso my 21, trisomy 18 and trisomy 13. However sex chromosome aneuploidies are causing less severe syndromes. For the detection of these the Ã¢ÂÂgold stan dardÃ¢ÂÂ method is the cytogenetic analysis of fetal cells, karyograms shows all numerical and structural abnormalities, but it takes 2 4 weeks to get the reports. Molecular biological methods were developed to evercome on the long culture time, FISH and quantitative fluorescent PCR were introduced. In this work we show our experience with a commercial kit for the detection of sex chromosome aneuploidies. Methods: We analysed 20.173 amniotic fluid samples in a period of 2006 2013 in our department. A conventional cytogenetic analysis was perfor med on the samples. We checked the reliability of quantitative fluorescent PCR and DNA fragment analyis on those samples where sex chromosomal aneuploidy was diagnosed. Results: From the 20.173 amniotic fluid samples we found 50 samples with sex chromosome aneuploidy. There were 19 samples showing 46, XO, 17 samples with 46, XXY, 9 samples with 47, XXX and 5 samples with 47, XYY karyotypes.

In the first pregnancy (2009), ul trasound examination at 29 weeks of gestation revealed fetal macrosomia (parameters>99Ã¢ÂÂ°), macroglossia, depressed nasal bridge, hypertelorism, nephromegaly, clinodactyly and polyhydramnios. The differential diagnosis between overgrowth syndromes was performed, but most of these syndromes share the same pathological findings, so it was difficult to differentiate them prenatally. However, after comprehensive lite rature analysis, we notice specific phenotype sings in mother as suspected mutation carrier (Golabi and Rosen, 1984) and fetal facial 3D evaluation, gender, absence of omphalocele and CNS structural defects enabled to con centrate on SGBS as the most probable diagnosis.

23214,"Background: We routinely perform SNP array analysis as a first tier test for all prenatal indications. Array detects more clinically relevant anomalies including pathogenic aberrations that are not related to the indication. The chance of finding these so called unexpected diagnoses (UD) is one of the reasons that the use of array in prenatal diagnosis is controversial. We will show the relevance of detecting UDs, based on the nature, prevalence, coun seling and outcome of the affected pregnancies. Methods: In 2010 2014 3,326 patients were referred for prenatal SNP array testing (Illumina): 1,682 pregnancies with and 1,644 without ultra sound anomalies. All cases of UD were discussed in a multidisciplinary team consisting of laboratory specialists and clinical geneticists before disclosure. All patients received pre and post test counseling. Psychological help was available if required. Results: In 1:208 (16/3,326) cases an UD was found. Eleven were severe early onset untreatable diseases. In 9/11 severe cases (e.g. Duchenne mus cular dystrophy, Angelman syndrome) the UD helped the couples in making a decision about the course of their pregnancy. In 1 case the UD (22q11 de letion) was found later in the pregnancy when termination was no longer a possibility. In this case delivery was transferred to a tertiary hospital. No severe late onset diseases were detected. Conclusion: We will show that in the great majority the UD was relevant for counseling and pregnancy management. This adds another reason to the known recommendations to use SNP array for all prenatal indications.",2015

DNA from ovarian tissue cells of females in their reproductive age (women 29 +/ 0.,8 years) who had their ovarian tissue cryopreserved and consented to research was subjected chromosomal aneuploidy screening by VeriSeq (Illumina), MLPA (Subtelomeric mix, MRC Holland), QF PCR (Devyser) and arrayCGH examinations (24Sure V3, Illumina).VeriSeq detected low level mosaicism in 4/39 cases (10.3%) with monosomy of chromosome 19, trisomy 4, 21 (isolated) and combined with trisomies 4, 12. QF PCR did not confirm trisomy 21 mosaicism revealed by VeriSeq, since it is below the detection limit of QF PCR. On the other hand, MLPA (sub telomeric mix) revealed duplications/deletions of long and short arms in 5/36 (13.9 %): dupl. chrom. 21p (gene STCH), associated in 2/5 cases with del. chrom. 16p (DECR2), in 2/7 with deletion of chromosome 16q (GAS8), in 1/5 with dupl. chrom. 2p/3p (ACP1), including del. chrom. 13p (PSPC1). All suspective results will be expanded by centromeric mix and verified by a CGH, including low level mosaicism from the VeriSeq assay.

23216,"The nuclear lamina (NL) is a filamentous protein meshwork, composed es sentially of lamins, situated between the inner nuclear membrane and the chromatin. Evidence from rodents suggests a role for the NL during sper miogenesis. The mouse spermatid NL is composed of the ubiquitous lamin B1 and the spermatid specific lamin B3, an N terminally truncated isoform of lamin B2. To explore the NL in human spermatids, we used RT PCR on RNA extracted from spermatozoa (remnants of spermatid transcripts) and immunofluorescence on human testis to reveal a lamin B3 transcript pre sent in human spermatids, and B type lamins as the only lamins detectable in human spermatids. Unlike the mouse, we detected lamin B2 expression in human spermatids. Like the mouse proteins, we show that human lamin B3, but not lamin B2, induces nuclear deformation, when ectopically expressed in HeLa cells. We detected B type lamins at the nuclear periphery in human spermatids, except in the region covered by the acrosome, and as sperma tids mature the B type lamins recede towards the flagellum. Only lamin B1 remains detectable on 33 47% of ejaculated spermatozoa. On spermatozoa selected for normal head density, however, this fell to <6%, suggesting that loss of the NL signal may accompany sperm nucleus compaction. We also show that the presence of lamin B2 transcripts is variable in human sper matozoa samples. The similarities between lamin expression during human and rodent spermiogenesis, strengthens evidence that the NL and lamin B3 have conserved functions during the remodelling of the mammalian sper matid nucleus.",2015

An estimated 10% of couples have difficulty conceiving their own child and in 40% of cases there is evidence of a male cause, most often reduced sperm production. Assisted reproductive techniques provide solutions for many couples, but in most cases the primary cause of infertility, and the con sequences for future generations, remain undetermined, with only a handful of causal mutations identified. We have studied a consanguineous family in which five of the six sons have severe oligozoospermia, 0.05x106 sperm per ml (normal , > 20x106). Genome wide linkage analysis identified a critical region of homozygosity, containing 134 genes (LOD score Z,3.1 at ÃÂ¸,0.01). Sequencing the entire region revealed a single coding variant that was homozygous in the five oligozoospermic sons, heterozygous in the father and absent from public databases. The variant, p. Glu101Ter, is in a gene of unknown function that we have termed OZF13 (Oligozoospermia factor 13), and is predicted to pre vent expression of the protein. We have sequenced OZF13 in 100 infertile men with severe oligozoospermia or azoospermia and identified a unique missense variant affecting a conserved amino acid. In human and mouse, we show that OZF13 predominates in the testis and localises to the cyto plasm of spermatocytes.

To date, only 24 cases of trisomy 18p have been reported in the literature, making it difficult to define a potentially associated phenotype.

Here, none of the 36 most common mutations in CFTR gene were found. These data are in concordance with the previously diagnosed oligozoospermia and azoosper mia respectively. Interestingly, we could determine a deletion of the PAR2 in two patients using FISH and additionally a duplication of the PAR1 in one of those. We performed SNParray analysis in two patients to determine the constitution of the Y chromosome. Analysis of one revealed an unclear de letion pattern in the region Yq11.223 q11.23. The analysis of the other one resulted in a huge deletion on Yq11.221 q12.ConclusionsWe will provide detailed case comparison which shows, that performing ad ditional FISH and SNParrays can help to clarify the aberration status of the Y chromosome.

23222,"Rosemon Hospital Dermatology Departement, Cayenne, France. Oculocutaneous albinism (OCA) is an autosomal recessive disorder charac terized by hypomelanosis of the skin, hair, and eyes, associated with redu ced visual acuity, nystagmus, and photophobia. Recently, two new types of albinism non syndromic have been identified OCA6 (SLC24A5) and OCA7 (C10orf11).(1)Cases : Two women, aged 22 and 65 years, lived in a village along the Ma roni River in South America. They were not from the same family. They had a particular albinism, with similar clinical ophtalmologic characteristics : brown iris, photophobia, reduced visual acuity and nystagmus,but their hair was blond at birth and become darker with age. Their skin was light brown. They were sensitive to the sun exposure and might turn brown. The second patient had a significant pachydermia with age (2).We analyzed these patients by Next Generation Sequencing technology with a panel of genes involved in syndromic and non syndromic OCA (TYR, OCA2, TYRP1,SLC45A2, GPR143, HPS 1 to 6, SLC24A5, MITF, PAX3, SOX10, EDN3, EDNRB). We found the same homozygous variant in these two patients, c.521G>A/ p. Arg174Lys in exon 5 of SLC24A5 gene. This variant had never been described before in the literature. This variant was not reported in the international database of mutations HGMD. There is no frequency data in ESP , EXAC, dbSNP . The prediction software Polyphen and Mutation taster predicted this variant as probably damaging. Our finding of a novel homozygous mutation in SLC24A5 in two patients from french Guiana strengthens the importance of screening this gene in OCA (3).(1) Wei et al., 2013 (2) Montoliu et al. 2014 (3) Morice Picard et al.,2013PM02.02The COL4A4 p.

Introduction: Alport syndrome is characterized by progressive hereditary nephritis, hearing loss and ocular anomalies. The disease is caused by CO L4A5, COL4A3 and COL4A4 gene mutations. Materials and Methods: Twelve patients with hematuria and sensorineural hearing loss were included, in whom carriership of p. Gly624Asp COL4A5 mutation (the most frequent one in Czech patients) was excluded. Sequen cing of the whole coding sequence of the COL4A3 , COL4A4 and COL4A5 genes was performed using either Sanger sequencing on ABI3130 (1 patient) or the ALPORT MASTR kit (Multiplicom) with subsequent next generation se quencing at Illumina platform (11 patients). MLPA was performed to detect genomic COL4A5 and COL4A3 rearrangements. In one patient wholegenome SNP array was performed. Results: Five of the twelve patients carried c.1598G>A, p. Gly533Asp muta tion in COL4A4 gene in either homozygous (4 patients) or heterozygous (1 patient) state. All the homozygots also carried the same 44 polymorphisms in COL4A3 or COL4A4 genes in homozygous state. MLPA excluded deletion of COL4A3 , thus making deletion of the whole region unprobable. SNP array showed loss of heterozygosity of 250 Mb at various sites of the genome of one patient due to consanguinity, including 48 Mb at 2q32.1 to 2q37.1 regi on (COL4A3 and CO4A4 genes are localised at 2q36.3). All the patients with the mutation were of Romani origin. Conclusion: The COL4A4 p. Gly533Asp mutation is prevalent in Czech Alport syndrome patients of Romani origin, consanguinity being responsible for its frequent occurrence in homozygous state.

We ai med to identify causative genes in 311 AMC subjects recruited through a UK national study. Clinical phenotyping and genetic analysis were performed using various methods: single gene sequencing, MLPA, aCGH, custom panel and exome sequencing. Our cohort was subdivided into phenotypic sub groups for analysis: 56 participants (18%) had bilateral anophthalmia/seve re microphthalmia, 37 (12%) had bilateral microphthalmia (+/ coloboma), 175 (56%) had unilateral anophthalmia/microphthalmia (+/ contralateral defects), and 43 (14%) had other phenotypes e.g. isolated colobomas or Pe tersÃ¢ÂÂ Anomaly. Thirty four of the 56 severe cases received a diagnosis, in cluding deletion/mutations in: SOX2 (15 [27%]), OTX2 (7 [14%]), VSX2 (3 [5.4%]), ALDH1A3 (2 [3.6%]), TFAP2A (2 [3.6%]), FOXE3 (2 [3.6%]), also one each: PAX6, STRA6, BMP7, GJA8. SOX2 (7.4%), OTX2 (3.5%) and FO XE3 (1.6%) were the most common causative genes identified, with VXS2, BMP7, CHD7 and TFAP2A each accounting for 1%. Seventy two participants who initially received single gene screening proceeded to 187 targeted gene sequencing. Pathogenic variants in known genes were found in 5 (including CHD7 and FOXE3); a further 51 had variants of unknown significance (VUS) in known/candidate genes. Of 15 participants with whole exome analysis; 3 had pathogenic variants in known genes (including PAX6 and BCOR) and 9 had VUS. This study represents the largest reported phenotype genotype study of patients with eye anomalies.

23224,"Microphthalmia, anophthalmia and coloboma are developmental anomalies of the eye and occur in approximately 3 in 10,000 births. They are a he terogeneous group of genetic conditions, with 111 genes identified based on published case reports and genetic databases. We identified a hetero zygous de novo deletion of chromosome 19p13.2 affecting a minimum of 46kb spanning regions of Olfactomedin 2 (OLFM2) and collagen, type V, al pha 3 (COL5A3) by array CGH in a patient with bilateral microphthalmia and cloudy vascularised corneas. While COL5A3 has not been implicated in mammalian eye function, Olfm2 is expressed in the retina and ganglion cells during mouse eye development. OLFM2 has also been implicated in open angle glaucoma and elevated intraocular pressure in a Japanese population. Therefore, we screened the exons and flanking regions of OLFM2 for vari ants in a cohort of 261 patients with developmental eye anomalies using LightScannerÃÂ® technology, with subsequent validation by Sanger sequen cing. We identified novel mutations in three members of this cohort. These included two variants in the 5Ã¢ÂÂ untranslated region (UTR) of OLFM2 and an intronic C>A 20bp 5Ã¢ÂÂ of exon 5. Of the 5Ã¢ÂÂ UTR variants, one is a 4bp insertion/ deletion and the second is a G/C substitution, both occurring approximately 60bp 5Ã¢ÂÂ of translation start site, separated by only 4bp and predicted to af fect transcription factor binding. We suggest that OLFM2 is a new gene for eye developmental anomalies, in particular associated with microphthalmia, and should be included when considering eye genes to screen in these conditions.",2015
23225,"The aim of this study was to identify and functionally characterize a novel candidate gene for autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa (adRP). Ten in dividuals of a Belgian adRP family in which known adRP loci were excluded underwent genome wide linkage analysis, resulting in two novel candidate loci with a maximum LOD score of 1.7. Whole exome sequencing in two af fected individuals (HiSeq, Illumina) revealed a missense variant c.2417A>G p.(Tyr806Cys) in the SF3B2 gene encoding the splicing factor 3b, subunit 2. The Tyr residue is highly conserved, several predictions suggest an effect on protein function. The change is predicted to disrupt a phosphorylation site. The variant co segregates with adRP and is absent in 300 controls. No addi tional SF3B2 mutations were found in 472 unrelated adRP patients (ERDC consortium). Ubiquitous expression of SF3B2 was demonstrated in human tissues, including retina and RPE. Localization in perinuclear and nuclear areas was shown in 661W mouse cells. Sf3b2 knockdown in Xenopus was performed using targeted injection of a splicing blocking morpholino (Gene Tools), showing gross developmental anomalies affecting the eye. In conclusion, SF3B2 was identified as a novel candidate gene for adRP . SF3B2 is required for binding of the U2 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNP) to the branchpoint and is involved in early spliceosome assem bly. Protein protein interactions have been identified between SF3B2, SNRNP200 and PRPF8, two proteins implicated in adRP . So far, of the seven known adRP genes involved in splicing, six encode components of the U4/U6 U5 triple small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (tri snRNP) complex. Our stu dy potentially involves other components of the spliceosome apart from the tri snRNP complex in adRP .",2015
23226,"Introduction: Autosomal recessive nonsyndromic hearing loss (ARNSHL) is usually prelingual, nonprogressive and severe to profound. Up to date it was accounted to mutations in 55 genes (Hereditary Hearing Loss Home page, http://hereditaryhearingloss.org), where the number is still rising. TMPRSS3 gene mutations account for less than 1 % of autosomal recessive nonsyndromic hearing loss (ARNSHL) in Caucasians. In Slovenians, 26.6 % of congenitally deaf patients and 11 % of progressive hearing loss patients had biallelic GJB2 mutations, where other genetic causes of ARNSHL were not exploited so far. Material and Methods: Targeted next generation sequencing in the index family with congenitally deaf parents and their son was performed initially, followed by Sanger sequencing of selected TMPRSS3 region in 35 patients with ARNSHL and no mutation identified in GJB2 or GJB6 genes. Results: Next generation sequencing in the index family revealed that a son and his mother were homozygous for TMPRSS3 c.208delC (p. His70Thrfs*19) variant. Father was digenic compound heterozygote for the same variant and common GJB2 c.35delG variant. Additionally, we identified 3 patients homozygous for TMPRSS3 c.208delC in a cohort of ARNSHL patients. Conclusions: TMPRSS3 mutations detected in altogether 13,1% of the stu died patients seem to be an important cause of ARNSHL in Slovenia resul ting in uniform phenotype with profound congenital hearing loss and satisf actory hearing and speech recognition after cochlear implantation.",2015
23227,"Behr syndrome (MIM#210000) is characterized by early onset optic neu ropathy associated with ataxia, spasticity, peripheral neuropathy and de velopmental delay. Although this disorder is believed to be inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, it might be heterogeneous encompassing several etiologies. Recently, we reported two brothers affected with adult onset Behr like syndrome caused by a heterozygous mutation in the optic atrophy 1 (OPA1 ) gene. Heterozygous mutations in OPA1 , a gene encoding for a dynamin related GTPase involved in mitochondrial dynamics and mtD NA maintenance, are the main causes of autosomal dominant optic atrophy (DOA). As many as 20% of persons carrying heterozygous OPA1 mutations are affected with the so called Ã¢ÂÂDOA plusÃ¢ÂÂ consisting in optic neuropathy as sociated with extra ocular signs including deafness, ataxia, peripheral neu ropathy and mitochondrial myopathy with multiple mtDNA deletions. We here report four children affected with early onset Behr syndrome caused by compound heterozygous OPA1 mutations. These four children are affected with a strikingly similar early onset neurological syndrome as sociating severe optic neuropathy (4/4), cerebellar ataxia with cerebellar atrophy at MRI (4/4), peripheral neuropathy (4/4), digestive involvement (2/4) and deafness (1/4).To date, compound heterozygosity in OPA1 has been proven in 6 patients (including those reported here) all affected with severe early onset syndro mic optic atrophy. Intriguingly, the same variant p. Ile382Met, involving a highly conserved re sidue in the OPA1 GTPase domain, was recurrently found in five of six pati ents in this series. Although the p. Ile382Met mutation on its own might have only mild consequences, it may combine with another mutation to induce a severe pathological condition which is consistent with a semi dominant mode of inheritance.

23228,"Congenital cataract is a Mendelian disorder that affects the eye lens, a non vascular transparent tissue, causing distortions of the light giving an opaque appearance and loss of transparency that leads to vision problems. This con dition is the worldwide leading cause of visual impairment and blindness for children (Chan, Wai H. et al. 2012). Several genes are known to be re sponsible for the autosomic dominant type of cataract, the most common in the world population. However recessive inheritance has also been reported and it is usually associated with other ocular conditions that worsen the vi sion making it difficult to treat (Kondo, Y., et al. 2013). In this study, a family of healthy parents and three affected children with zonular, nuclear conge nital cataract (two sons and one daughter) is described. Exome sequencing using SureSelect Human All Exon 50Mb V4 (50X depth) was performed to uncover the genes responsible for the condition in the family. Bioinformatic analysis using the reference genome GRCh37 did not find variants in any of the known genes, however we did identify a novel homozygous variant P .Gly377fs in exon 7 of the SLC37A4 gene (NM_001164280.1). According to polyphen (Adzhubei IA. et al. 2010) this variant is considered damaging. Mutations in this gene have been found in patients with glycogen storage di sease, however the individuals in our family show no clinical manifestations of the disease. We might speculate that an abnormal glucose homeostasis caused by this mutation might lead to an accumulation of sorbitol forming a sugar cataract.

23229,"Choroideremia (CHM) is an X linked chorioretinal dystrophy affecting 1 in 50,000 people. Typically, males develop initial symptoms from night blind ness to peripheral visual field loss leading to complete blindness. Female carriers are generally asymptomatic, although mild symptoms can be ob served. It is caused by mutations in the CHM gene that encodes Rab escort protein 1 (REP 1), an essential component of Rab geranylgeranyl transfera se (Rab GGTase) that controls cellular trafficking in secretory and vesicular pathways. We characterized 33 out of 45 unrelated families with clinical diagnoses of CHM. The molecular diagnostic pipeline followed include haplotype ana lysis, direct sequencing, RNA studies, combined MLPA and qF PCR, CGH arrays, cytogenetic studies and, in a family, whole exome sequencing. The mutational spectrum included complete or partial deletions of CHM gene being the most frequent mutations identified (13 families; 39%). Among them, exon 9 deletion was recurrent affecting three families (10%). Second ly, most pathogenic alleles carried nonsense mutations (11 families; 33%). Mutation p. Arg293* was the most frequent one, being present in four fa milies (12%) from diverse geographical origins: Spanish, Portuguese and Polish. Frameshift p. Thr175fs* mutation was found in one Spanish and one Portuguese families. Our diagnostic pipeline allowed us to achieve the molecular characterizati on in 73% of cases. The remainder cases should be clinically reviewed. Al ternatively, other mutations in uncovered regions or in other genes can be the cause. To identify the causative mutations in CHM patients is essential in patient management and to the improvement of therapies focused on cor recting the primary genetic defect.

23230,"Epithelial recurrent erosion dystrophy (ERED) is an autosomal dominant condition associated with painful corneal epithelial erosions, typically star ting within the first decade of life. Between attacks the corneal epithelium either appears normal or there are a small number of epithelial micro cysts, consistent with a healing epithelial erosion. Sub epithelial haze may then progress over several decades, which can lead to central corneal scaring. Our goal was to identify the genetic cause of ERED. A large, genealogical ly expanded, ERED pedigree of northern Swedish origin was identified and whole exome sequencing (WES) was performed using DNA from dis parate branches of the family. A novel, non synonymous COL17A1 variant, c.2816C>T , p.(Thr939Ile), was found to co segregate with disease in the ex tended pedigree. COL17A1 encodes collagen type XVII alpha 1, a structural component of hemidesmosomes (multi protein complexes that provides attachment for basal epithelial cells to the underlying basement membra ne) and thus represents an excellent candidate gene for ERED. Previously, in a family with a similar ERED like phenotype, disease was shown to be linked to Chr10q23 q24 encompassing COL17A1, but the authors reported that no mutation was identified (Sullivan, et al., 2003). Our re evaluation of this data suggested that the synonymous COL17A1 variant, c.3156C>T p.(Gly1052Gly), that co segregated with disease could create a cryptic spli ce donor site. We experimentally confirmed that this synonymous variant leads to aberrant pre mRNA splicing of the COL17A1 transcript in vitro, and we suggest that both of these ERED like corneal dystrophies are allelic and can be attributed to mutations in COL17A1.",2015
23231,"IntroductionOne third of congenital cataract cases have a genetic cause. Today about 39 loci are involved in isolated or primary cataracts; several complex syndro mes including cataract with multiple anomalies and intellectual disability have been mapped. Here is the first report of gene identification in inherited congenital cataracts associated only with intellectual disability. Materials and MethodsA total of 3 affected patients and 2 unaffected parents belonging to a consan guineous Tunisian family with congenital cataract associated to intellectual disability were analysed. Homozygosity mapping, a successful method in identifying genetic defects in consanguineous families, we carried out a genome wide scan for the five members. Moreover, we used the integrated Systems Tool for Eye gene discovery (iSy TE) for the identification of lens specific genes with high or low expression. ResultsGWS identified 2 homozygous candidate regions at chromosome 11 (p11.2 p11.12) and (q11 q13.1). These regions were analysed by the iSyTE allo wing the identification of less highly expressed lens disease associated genes to non syndromic congenital cataract. Four genes (STX3 (11q12.1), CCDC86 (11q12.2), SLC3A2 (11q12.2) and SLC15A3 (11q13)) were selec ted according to their early expression in lens development.

They include pan ophthalmic disorders such as anophthalmia, microphthalmia (A/M) and aniridia, and also anomalies restricted only to the anterior or posterior segment. Our aim was to design and validate a customized high resolution CGH array to search for rearrangements across eye developmental genes causing ocular malformations. Material and Methods: A custom whole genome oligonucleotide CGH array (Agilent, 4x180K format) was designed to cover all exonic, intronic and re gulatory regions from 160 eye developmental genes and the WAGR related locus at 11p13, using 130K probes.

Here we investigated the spectrum of TGFBI mutations in patients with a cor neal dystrophy attending Moorfields Eye Hospital. In total, 58 unrelated pro bands with a suspected TGFBI associated corneal phenotype were screened for mutations by direct sequencing. The most commonly identified mutati ons occurred at two known mutation hotspot residues of the TGFBI protein, Arg 124 and Arg 555. The mutations included c.370C>T; p.(Arg124Cys) in 17 probands, c.1664G>A; p.(Arg555Gln) in 16, c.1663C>T; p.(Arg555Trp) in 11 and c.371G>A; p.(Arg124His) in 5 patients. The phenotypes associated with each mutation were LCD, TBCD, GCD1 and GCD2, respectively. Howe ver, the hotspot mutation c.371G>T; p.(Arg124Leu) associated with an RBCD phenotype was only observed in one proband. Interestingly, the c.1868G>A; p.(Gly623Asp) mutation was identified in 4 patients, with clinical features of RBCD, LCD or both, indicating a lack of genotype phenotype correlation. Two probands with LCD had c.1859C>A; p.(Ala620Asp) and c.1877A>G; p.(His626Arg) mutations and one proband with RBCD had a c.1874T>A; p.(Val625Asp) mutation. One patient with LCD, who was mutation negative for TGFBI, had a mutation in GSN that resulted in a re diagnosis to Meretoja syndrome.

23234,"Introduction: One in every 500 individuals presents severe to profound sensorineural hearing loss. According to the World Health Organization, hearing loss is the most common sensory impairment. It is estimated that 60% of congenital hearing loss may be due to genetic mutations, with high genetic heterogeneity. Over 80 genes are known to be involved in hearing loss. Traditional diagnostic techniques have become slow and costly for screening this large number of genes. High throughput platforms based on Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) have provided an optimal solution for diagnostics. Materials and Methods: We employed Targeted Genomic Enrichment (TGE) and massively parallel sequencing to capture the exons of 284 genes as sociated with deafness in humans and mice. We performed whole exome sequencing (WES) on a portion of the families. A bioinformatics workflow was implemented, providing an output of potential causative variants. The segregation of a subset of variants was examined in families and controls. When relevant, functional analysis was performed. Results: One Brazilian and 67 Israeli Jewish families were evaluated. Vari ants in over 20 genes, including TMC1, POU3F4, MYO6, and MYO15A, were identified, solving 38% of the cases in the Jewish Israeli population. A MYH9 mutation segregated with deafness in the Brazilian family. Conclusions: These results demonstrate that diagnostics for deafness can be performed optimally using NGS, leading to a better understanding of the genetic profile of hearing impaired populations and mechanisms of hearing loss.

23235,"Neuropathic pain is defined as pain arising as a direct consequence of a lesi on or a disease affecting the somatosensory system and it affects around 1 in 4 diabetic patients in the UK. The purpose of this genome wide association study was to identify genetic contributors to diabetic neuropathic pain. We obtained a GWAS dataset of 6,927 diabetic individuals from the Genetics of Diabetes Audit and Research Tayside (GoDARTS) project and accessed the prescription history of these individuals. Cases of neuropathic pain were de fined as diabetic patients with a multiple prescription history of at least one of five drugs specifically indicated for the treatment of neuropathic pain. Controls were diabetic individuals who were not prescribed any of these drugs, nor amitriptyline, carbamazepine, or nortriptyline. Those who had one use of the five specific neuropathic pain drugs were further excluded from controls. Logistic regression analyses were performed to test genetic associations, adjusting with covariates. Overall, 961 diabetic neuropathic pain cases and 3,260 diabetic controls were identified. We found a cluster in the Chr1p35.1 (ZSCAN20 TLR12P) with a lowest P value of 2.74 x 10 7 at rs71647933 in females and a cluster in the Chr8p23.1, next to HMGB1P46 with a lowest P value of 8.02x 10 7 at rs6986153 in males. The narrow sense heritability of neuropathic pain from the overall dataset was 14.7%. Sex specific narrow sense heritability was higher in males (30.0%) than in females (14.7%).This GWAS on diabetic neuropathic pain provides evidence for the sex specific involvement of Chr1p35.1 (ZSCAN20 TLR12P) and Chr8p23.1 (HMGB1P46) with the disorder, indicating the need for of further research.

The most prevalent cause of congenital EL is Marfan Syndrome (MFS), which requires a lifelong cardiovascular follow up. Because of the evolving phenotype, FBN1 testing is often requested in children with EL. In patients without an FBN1 mutation, the absence of a definite diagnosis may cause psychological distress and unnecessary examinations. Recently, mutations in LTBP2 and ADAMTSL4 have been implicated in congenital glaucoma and microspherophakia with EL, and EL et pupillae, respectively. We analyzed the FBN1, ADAMTSL4 and LTBP2 genes in 207 probands refer red for EL over a period of 22 months using a step wise PCR based next ge neration sequencing approach. One hundred fifty four probands harbored an FBN1 mutation (of which 47 fulfilled the 2010 Ghent criteria for MFS) and 53 did not (of which 9 patients fulfilled the criteria). Of these 53 patients, four harbored biallelic mutations in ADAMTSL4 (c.767_786del; c.2237G>A, c.2021_2022delCT , c.2977C>T , c.963dup). One proband had a homozygous LTBP2 mutation (c.4964A>G; p.

23237,"Introduction: Next generation sequencing (NGS) panels are increasingly used in molecular diagnosis of genetically heterogeneous eye diseases. We report the yield of these tests in a clinical setting. Materials and methods: We custom designed a comprehensive panel that included NGS and array comparative genome hybridization (aCGH) for 208 nuclear genes and mitochondrial genome sequencing. We also offered tar geted nextgen panels for specific conditions such as retinitis pigmentosa. 222 individuals with eye diseases were tested using comprehensive or tar geted nextgen sequencing, mitochondrial genome testing and/or array CGH panels. Results: We found pathogenic variants in 71/222 (32%) individuals. Of the se positive results, 59 were identified by comprehensive or targeted nextgen panels alone, 12 individuals had pathogenic copy number variants identi fied on aCGH, of which 6 were for dominant conditions and 6 for a second re cessive change. In 10 of these individuals, one definitive pathogenic variant was identified, the second was a variant of unknown significance. Another 14 individuals had variants that need additional analysis to determine signi ficance. No pathogenic mitochondrial variants related to eye disorders were found in 99 individuals that had testing. .Conclusions: Nextgen sequence analysis alone identified ~27% conclusive pathogenic molecular finding and when complemented with aCGH identi fied an additional 7 8% contributory disease causing variation but none from the mitochondrial genome sequence analysis. Therefore, complete mitochondrial genome sequencing should be reserved only for individuals with suspected syndromic mitochondrial disorder. The most efficient and cost effective testing is a clinical phenotype driven targeted Nextgen se quencing panel with reflex to aCGH in those that have negative sequencing results.",2015
23238,"The genetic bases of complex traits such as Normal Hearing Function (NHF) and Age Related Hearing Loss (ARHL) are largely unknown. Multivariate GWAS is a new and powerful tool for detecting candidate genes. Here, it was applied to simultaneously analyse hearing thresholds and also combine them with Body Mass Index (BMI) and Blood Pressure (BP), as potentially interacting traits. A meta analysis of 2059 subjects from isolated cohorts of Italy and Cen tral Asia were analysed by multivariate linear mixed model regression (Zhou&Stephens 2014) and results were combined, based on inverse va riance weights (R package MultiMeta). After adjusting for sex, age and rela tedness, the following traits were tested: (a) 4 HT (0.5, 2, 4, 8 kHz); (b) HT and BMI and (c) HT and BP .Preliminary results for HT (a) identified the following top SNPs: rs181948008 (p,4e 09) within CYP4B1 gene, rs1523730 (p,3.04E 07) close to CNT NAP2 a gene located within the deafness locus DFNB13 and rs72984055 (p,2.27E 07) within MMP20 (other metalloproteinases were already invol ved in hearing loss). In order to investigate previous epidemiological data in which higher BMI was associated with poorer hearing (Curhan et al. 2013), a genome wide analysis (b) was performed revealing suggestive associa tion with rs62418085 (p,2.47E 07) located within PRIM2, a gene already associated with fatty acid levels. Up to date results will be presented and discussed. In conclusion, the multivariate approach can give significant boost in stati stical power for correlated traits and allows investigating genetic bases for different related traits.",2015

23241,"Introduction: The Newborn Hearing Screening Program (NHSP) is a way to promote early diagnosis of hearing impairment1. Concomitantly with early diagnosis and intervention, it is important to search for the primary cause. In developed countries about 50% of the causes of isolated deafness have a genetic origin. In Brazil most of cases are due to environmental factors, such as congenital infections, perinatal asphyxia, kernicterus and meningitis 2. Objective: To investigate the causes of hearing loss diagnosed at NHSP .Method: Retrospective study of records of 21 deaf diagnosed from August 2003 to July 2014. Results of laboratory tests, imaging and genetic testing were analyzed. Results: Twenty four children had a sensorineural hearing impairment, 20 were bilateral. Eight cases of newborns remained in Newborn Intensive Unit. One case showed craniofacial anomalies and 2 patients had inner ear malformations. In 3 newborn the hearing loss was due to perinatal asphy xia. Two newborns had history of infectious disease. Considering the gene tic factors, 4 individuals had a history family of deafness; 3 newborns were from consanguineous family, 4 newborns were homozygous for 35delG in the GJB2 gene, and 2 presented the A827G mutation in the MTRNR1 gene. Three cases the etiology remains unknown. Conclusion: The early etiological research hearing impairment contributes to support and assist disabled hearing and their families and also for assi stance in public health measures.1 Morton CC, Nance WE.

23242,"Hearing loss is the most common sensory disorders and can affect up to 1/500 newborns. Before NGS platform could be implemented in diagnostic labs, the molecular diagnosis of non syndromic hearing loss (NSHL) was re lying solely on the screening for mutations at the DFNB1 locus. Recently, we have developed a panel consisting of 71 genes known to be involved in ARNSHL, ADNSHL and X linked NSHL. The libraries were generated with Il lumina Nextera Rapid Capture Custom Enrichment or Nimblegen SeqCap EZ Choice and run on an Illumina MiSeq platform. All NSHL patients, referred over the last 10 years and negative for DFNB1 mutations (more than 500) are currently being tested. The strategy applied is as follow: when recessive inheritance is suspected only the patient is te sted by NGS; when dominant inheritance is suspected, a minimum of three relatives (the patient, affected and control family members) are tested. In all cases, validation and segregation analyses of the potential pathogenic vari ants is performed by Sanger sequencing. Although X linked HL is considered as rare, weÃ¢ÂÂve already identified mutati ons in the 3 known genes (POU3F4, SMPX and PRPS1) in 3 different families.

The genes responsible for the occurrence of hearing loss usually encode proteins located in the inner ear. Majority of patients with autosomal, recessive deafness harbour mutations in only one gene GJB2. Mutations in other genes, which products are direct ly involved in the hearing process, may also result in hearing loss. To date, approximately 300 genes involved in the processing of auditory information has been described, and still the new one are discovered. Efficient search for variants in the gene structure requires the use of the most modern techni ques of molecular biology, such as the next generation sequencing.

The Middle Eastern population, comprised of different ethnic groups and known to exhibit high rates of consanguinity, has benefi ted from NGS. Furthermore, as many mutations first identified in this popu lation have been subsequently found worldwide, this population is instru mental in determining genes crucial for hearing. Materials and Methods: We applied targeted genomic enrichment along with massively parallel sequencing, encompassing 284 genes that included 121 human genes and 163 human orthologues of mouse deafness genes, on 91 families of Arab descent. One family underwent whole exon sequencing (WES). Results: This research uncovered novel mutations in 23 known deafness ge nes. A novel gene, SLC25A21 , associated with hearing loss was detected by WES. We were able to determine the causative mutation for deafness in 32% of our population. Conclusions: NGS is an optimal technology for genetic diagnosis of hearing loss. Challenges remain in the search for mutations responsible for deafness: to identify the causative variant, particularly when several variants exist and segregate in the family; to detect structural variations and regulatory ele ments and to prove their involvement in hearing impairment; and to prove mutations in a novel gene causes hearing loss by relevant functional assays.

Hereditary Hearing Loss (HHL) is an extremely genetically heterogeneous disorder that prompted us to develop a powerful diagnostic algorithm cha racterized by screening of 113 HHL genes by targeted re sequencing fol lowed, in negative cases, by whole exome sequencing to detect causative mutation in new genes. Thanks to this strategy we identified PSIP1/LEDGF as a novel gene causing sensorineural progressive HHL restricted to the me dium high frequencies and a variable eye phenotype (i.e. uveitis, optic neu ropathy) in an ltalian pedigree. Further clinical examinations of the affected members showed normal amplitude of the ABR indicating no involvement of the auditory nerve while VEP indicated some differences in terms of visu al acuity and optic nerve functionality. A frameshift deletion leading to a premature stop codon (c.1554_1555del, p. E518Dfs*2, p. T519X) with truncation of the last 12 amino acids and segre gating with the disease was detected. Our additional studies using different methodological approaches (i.e. cDNA analysis, RNA Seq, immunolabeling, etc.) demonstrate that: 1) this deletion does not lead to mRNA degradation 2) Psip1 is expressed in the nuclei of all hair cells and supporting cells of both mouse cochlea and vestibular system with the exclusion of the auditory nerve. Recently, PSIP1 was described as a transcriptional co activator regulated by miR 135b in cells of the mouse inner ear and as a possible protector against photoreceptor degeneration.

The high genetic heterogeneity, the incompleteness of disease specific databases and the elevated number of genes involved in IRD, often hamper the correct molecular diagnosis and patients stratification. To clarify IRD molecular profile, we used a next Generation Sequencing (NGS) strategy and designed a custom AmpliSeq panel (Life Technologies), containing the coding sequences of 72 disease related genes, for a total of 1649 amplicons. An in house bioinformatic pipeline was optimized to filter synonymous variants and polymorphism and to annotate variants with prediction algo rithm (dbNSFP) and disease specific databases (LOVD eye diseases, Retina International, RPGR database).A cohort of 40 samples was selected (29 patients, 11 healthy relatives). They underwent a complete ophthalmologic examination (visual acuity, anterior segment and fundus examination, ERG and/or EOG, OCT), as well as a gene tic counselling.

ZNF469 has been associated with Brittle cornea syndrome and central cor neal thickness. The latest study also revealed that rare heterozygous mutati ons in ZNF469 determine keratoconus (KTCN) susceptibility etiology. KTCN is a degenerative disorder of the eye characterized by stromal thinning and protrusion of the cornea, resulting in severe impairment of visual function. To investigate the contribution of ZNF469 to KTCN, we Sanger sequenced ZNF469 in 42 Polish KTCN patients and 49 Polish individuals with high my opia (HM) as a control group. The average number of ZNF469 variants per individual was 40.59520 and 40.26531 for KTCN and HM, respectively (Wil coxon Rank Sum test, p , 0.3601). Moreover, the average number of nonsyn onymous variants was 16.30952 and 16.0 for KTCN and HM, respectively (Wilcoxon Rank Sum test, p , 0.3724). All identified variants were previous ly reported. Minor allele frequency (MAF) was determined based on the whole exome sequencing results from 268 Polish patients without ocular abnormalities. Among missense variants, only one (rs528085780) has MAF Ã¢ÂÂ¤ 0.01 and has been identified in one patient with sporadic KTCN. However, the resulting Arg1864Lys substitution was not predicted to be deleterious based on different prediction algorithms and conservation scores. Summa rizing, we have not found a significant enrichment of pathogenic variants in ZNF469 in KTCN patients. High prevalence of ZNF469 variants identified in our KTCN group is typical for a common genetic variation observed in general population. Genetic factors different than variation in ZNF469 are responsible for KTCN development. Support: NCN 2013/08/T/NZ5/00754, NCN 2013/10/M/NZ2/00283",2015

In vitro studies confirmed deleterious effects of the latter on the main SOX10 functions, while about half of the resulting proteins are redistributed in nuclear bodies (foci) of undetermined nature and function.

NMNAT1 mutations cause a highly specific Leber congenital amaurosis phenotype characterized by severe neonatal neurodegeneration of the central retina with early onset optic atrophy. The purpose of this stu dy was to search for copy number variations (CNV) and mutations affecting 5Ã¢ÂÂ regulatory elements or splicing of the gene in 22 single heterozygote in dex cases with the NMNAT1 phenotype. Results: Three unique CNVs, i.e. a 1 exon duplication, a 1 exon deletion and a two exon deletion were identified in 3/22 patients. In addition, 5 distinct variants lying in the 5Ã¢ÂÂUTR of the gene were identified in 10/22 individu als. 1/5 UTR variant was shared by 6/10 individuals originating from the French Indian Ocean Island, La RÃÂ©union. This variant was undetectable in all available patient cDNAs (3/6), supporting down regulation or instability of the mutant mRNA. mRNA from 2/10 other individuals harboring other UTR variants were available which analysis was consistent with similar mRNA defects. Conclusion: Here, we report that at least 13/22 LCA individuals with single heterozygote NMNAT1 mutations carried a second disease allele undetected by Sanger sequencing of the NMNAT1 exome.

Pa thogenic or likely pathogenic outcomes were seen in 66 cases/families a working detection rate of 23%, which may indicate more relaxed clinical fil tering and/or increased affordability of testing recently, nevertheless remai ning relatively high. Local testing for familial mutations was carried out in 40 individuals. All 84 sequence and structural changes encountered, including 42 novel ones, have been recorded and evaluated systematically, comprising a curated set for data filtering and scoring. Apart from established polymor phisms, they have also been deposited in relevant clinical databases, adding to the publically available mutation/variation spectrum of OPA1 .",2015
23259,"JohnÃ¢ÂÂs, NL, Canada. Introduction: Clinical otosclerosis, a bone remodeling disease of the human temporal bone, involves hearing loss, usually with a conductive impairment associated with fixation of the stapes. Other regions of the otic capsule may also be involved, with variable clinical presentation and progression. Materials & Method: Subjects were a multiplex AD family from the island of Newfoundland identified with a 15 bp in frame deletion in the FOXL1 gene, and an Ontario proband identified with the same mutation from a cohort of 32 Ontario cases with surgically confirmed otosclerosis. Phenotype data included retrospective data acquisition from clinical charts (Newfoundland and Ontario) and prospective measures (Ontario) including behavioural au diometry, middle ear analyses (immitance and middle ear muscle acoustic reflexes) and otoacoustic emissions. Results: Phenotype analyses revealed a bilateral hearing loss in the New foundland proband, initially conductive in nature and later progressing to a mixed hearing loss. Newfoundland relatives with surgically confirmed otosclerosis (n,6) also exhibited a bilateral impairment, primarily of the conductive or mixed types; 2 cases did not undergo surgery and were con sidered non penetrant. The Ontario proband presented with a profound mixed loss in the right ear, and a mild sensorineural hearing loss in the left ear; acoustic middle ear muscle reflexes were absent despite normal middle ear compliance. Conclusions: Subjects with the FOXL1 mutation exhibit the hallmark fea tures of clinical otosclerosis. Physiological measures of middle ear function can be used to supplement the behavioural phenotype, and may enable ear ly detection of otosclerotic pathology.",2015

Perrault syndrome is a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterised by sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) in both sexes and primary ovarian insuf ficiency in 46, XX karyotype females. Perrault syndrome is genetically he terogeneous with variants in five genes reported to date, HSD17B4 , HARS2, LARS2, CLPP and C10orf2 . Subsequent to the original discovery studies, no further cases of Perrault syndrome due to variants in these genes have been reported. Here we present four families affected by Perrault syndrome with novel and previously reported mutations in HSD17B4, LARS2 and C10orf2 . The proband from each family was whole exome sequenced and the muta tions confirmed by Sanger sequencing. A female from family P1 was com pound heterozygous for a known and novel mutation in HSD17B4 , c.46G>A, p.(Gly16Ser) and c.244G>T , p.(Val82Phe), respectively. Two families (P2 and P3) had biallelic mutations in LARS2 . The affected female and male in P2 were homozygous for c.1565C>A, p.(Thr522Asn), previously associated with Perrault syndrome. Family P3 consisted of an affected female and male, who were compound heterozygous for c.1565C>A, p.(Thr522Asn) and c.351G>C, p.(Met117Ile). Affected members of both families showed a low frequency SNHL an unusual audiometric configuration previously described in Perrault syndrome caused by LARS2 mutations. A further affected female (family P4) with significant neurological disability was compound hetero zygous for mutations in C10orf2 , c.968G>A p.(Arg323Gln) and c.1196A>G p.(Asn399Ser). These cases independently confirm HSD17B4 , LARS2 and C10orf2 as causative of Perrault syndrome.",2015

The most rare causes of deafness in the world are X linked and mitochon drial forms of hearing impairment (1 2%). For the first time, we revealed identical abnormalities of inner ear in two brothers from Yakut family (Ea stern Siberia) with presumably X linked recessive deafness that are typical for the perilymphatic Gusher deafness syndrome (DFNX2, MIM304400) caused by mutations in the POU3F4 gene (MIM 300039). Computed tomo graphy studies demonstrated an abnormal dilatation of the internal acoustic canal (IAC) as well as an abnormally wide communication between the IAC and the inner ear compartment in both brothers. Parents had no any tem poral bone anomalies. To determine whether mutations in the POU3F4 gene (Xq21.1) are responsible for the hearing loss in these patients, we sequen ced the single exon of the POU3F4 gene. We identified novel nucleotide sub stitution c.977G>A in POU3F4 in hemizygous state in both probands, in the heterozygous state in their mother, and c.977G>A was absent in their father. Transition c.977G>A leads to stop codon (p. W325X) in the POU homeodo main of human transcription factor protein. Segregation of inner ear mal formations and novel mutation c.977G>A (p.

23262,"ARHL is a degenerative disease affecting millions of people worldwide. To date, very few potentially causative genes have been described. Based on our previous GWAS and expression data, a custom targeted re sequencing panel of 46 ARHL candidate genes was designed and used for screening 500 ARHL Italian patients coming from both inbred and outbred populations using Ion Torrent PGMÃ¢ÂÂ¢ technology. Data were filtered according to allele frequency and to pathogenicity prediction (i.e. in silico predictor tools). Twenty one mutations located in 14 different genes (8 frameshift, 2 stop gain and 11 missense) affecting 49 patients were detected. All mutations were absent in controls coming from the same populations as well as in any public database (or present at a very low frequency MAFÃ¢ÂÂ¤0,003). Missense mutations were predicted to be highly damaging. Both scenarios were present: different mu tations in the same gene as well as the same mutation in different patients. In some cases, human phenotype resembles that of already existing mice models. For example, a) 3 novel heterozygous frameshift deletions were detected in XIRP2 in patients showing a very similar phenotype to that re cently described in mice (Francis et al. 2015); b) a heterozygous missen se mutation was detected in four patients showing a high frequency HL in WBP2 gene, similar to that described in the corresponding mouse model (Buniello et al. 2014). Complete results will be presented. These findings demonstrate the usefulness of our approach (GWAS+ Expression studies + Mutation screening) further supporting the potential role of these genes in causing ARHL.",2015
23263,"IBILI, University of Coimbra, Coimbra, Portugal. Primary congenital glaucoma (PCG) is an ocular inherited autosomal reces sive disease, associated with CYP1B1 mutations. However, some of the pati ents do not have CYP1B1 mutations. This study aims to identify novel genes causative of PCG in these patients. Whole exome sequencing was performed in three unrelated patients and one trio. After annotation and variant filtration according to the autosomal recessive disease model, rare variants with a pathogenic functional impact were selected. The comparison of variants shared by the four patients did not identify a common mutated gene. The four samples had 4, 9, 5 and 8 altered genes, respectively. None of these genes were previously associated with glaucoma, except an RNASEH2C gene variant, mutated in one patient and confirmed in the trio analysis. This gene has been associated with Aicardi GoutiÃÂ¨res syn drome, characterized by severe neurological abnormalities together with congenital glaucoma. However, the patient does not have a typical pheno type. According to in silico previsions, this mutation leads to the loss of a donor splice site, creating a longer protein. Studies are underway to charac terize the RNASEH2C mutation in this family. Since no common mutated gene was found in our study and other reported studies, we suggest that PCG may be caused by mutations in different genes, consistent with an autosomal recessive model, or by an alternative model such as the polygenic, with heterozygous variants in different genes.

23265,"PurposeTo identify the genetic cause of a retintis pigmentosa phenotype observed in a Turkish consanguineous family. MethodsHomozygosity mapping was performed for five sibs, two of which are affec ted. Functional analysis of non coding SAMD7 variants was performed by luciferase assays and electroporation assays in mouse retinal explants with SAMD7 CBR reporter constructs (Hlawatsch et al. 2013).ResultsHomozygosity mapping revealed two candidate genes, namely RHO and SAMD7. A homozygous RHO mutation (c.448G>A, p. E150K) was found in the two affected sibs, while all other sibs were heterozygous carriers. No coding SAMD7 mutations were found. Interestingly, sequencing of the SAMD7 promoter and an enhancer in the two affected sibs revealed four homozygous variants located in the binding regions of the CRX transcription factor. The variants are known SNPs, with a low MAF of 1,6 %. The first three SNPs are located in a CRX binding region called CBR1, while the fourth SNP is located in CBR2. The combined SAMD7 CBR1/CBR2 mutated construct showed a significantly decreased SAMD7 reporter activity compared with the WT construct. ConclusionsA rare recessive RHO mutation (E150K) was found in consanguineous RP patients, consistent with previous reports (Kumaramanickavel et al., 1994; Azam et al., 2009 and Zhang et al., 2013). Moreover, functional analysis of four variants located in non coding, CRX binding regions of SAMD7, sugge sted a regulatory and synergistic effect on SAMD7 expression. As Samd7 has recently been identified as a novel Crx regulated transcriptional repressor in retina (Hlawatsch et al., 2013), we hypothesize that these SAMD7 vari ants might have a modifying effect on the retinal phenotype observed in this family.",2015

Nevertheless, modern sequencing platforms known under collective name Next generation sequencing or NGS is a huge help to solve this problem. We also could be able identifying disease causing mutations by NGS in different and unrelated retinopathy cases. In One case, the PRPH2 gene was homozygous mutated at nucleotide c.582 1(G>A) in 2 affected children of related parents. This change is a splice site variation that leads to vitelliform macular dystrophy. Further, we found in other family in the CRB1 gene mutation at c. T2106G (p. Y702X) causing macular dystrophy. Third case showed pathogenic mutation in the CNGA3 gene at c. A827G (p. N276S) causing achromatopsia type 2. A affected male was mutated in the gene TULP1 at position c.1450A>C (T484P) causing Leber Congenital Amaurosis (LCA) or RP type 14 and further affected female was positive for a change in the RDH12 gene at c.81delT (p. A27fs). Mutations in this gene cause Leber Congenital Amaurosis. All mentioned mutations are unreported. To validate pathogenic nature of these changes, we analyzed the mutations by Sanger sequencing and some predicting software.

Twenty six percent of these carry the same causal variant c.4539+2001G>A (known as V4). Haplotyping in V4 carriers showed a common region of 63 kb, suggestive of a founder mutation. Genotype phenotype correlations indicate a moderate to severe impact of V4 on the STGD1 phenotype. The remaining patients in whom no second ABCA4 mutation was identified underwent targeted resequencing of the entire genomic regions of ABCA4, BEST1 and PRPH2 (~ 500 kb in total) (HaloPlex Target Enrichment System, Agilent Technologies). Variant filtering was based on minor allele frequency, conservation score, splicing predictions and regulatory potential. Prelimi nary data in a pilot group show that the standard filtering yields approxi mately 130 variants per patient that require further investigation. In conclusion, causal variant V4 occurs in a high fraction of Belgian STGD1 patients and represents the first deep intronic founder mutation in ABCA4. This emphasizes the importance of augmented molecular genetic testing of ABCA4 in STGD1.

INTRODUCTION: Telomeres cells shortening during aging suggests that telomere length could be a biomarker of aging and age relate morbility. Telomerase compensates this shortening maintaining telomere ends by ad dition of desoxyribonucleic acid (DNA). Acquired cataract is one of the most common age related eye diseases but it is also present in a reduced number of young people. OBJETIVES: The aim of this report was to analyze the prognostic value of telomere length in young patients with cataracts and evaluate the effect of polymorphisms in telomerase genes on the susceptibility to develop ca taract in these subjects. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Telomere length was measured by quantitative polymerase chain reaction in peripheral blood leukocytes of 112 cases and 112 controls classified in two groups (60 years).To detect telomerase polymorphisms TERT1327C>T and TERC63G>A, Taq Man quantitave PCR method was used. RESULTS: Our results indicate that young population with cataracts has shorter telomeres than the same cohort of healthy subjects (p<0.01) and si milar to the older patients with cataracts. The onset of cataracts in younger adults may serve as an in vivo marker of primary aging and at the same time could alert us to other pathologies associated with telomeric shortening as cardiovascular diseases or cancer. We found a statistically significant association between GG homozygous of TERC63G>A rs2293607 polymorphism and an increased telomere shorte ning in healthy subjects (p,0.015).Thus, our results suggest that the development of cataracts in young people could be associated to a premature molecular aging.

The purpose was to search for pathogenic TMPRSS3 variants in Polish Caucasian HI patients. Materials and Methods: A strategy of iterative cycles of TMPRSS3 gene se quencing (initiated by whole exome sequencing in one subject performed on HiSeq 1500 Illumina ) combined with focused mutation screening which we termed Iterative Sequencing and Variant Screening (ISVS) was applied to ~2200 unrelated HI patients recruited among patients from Institute of Physiology and Pathology of Hearing. Approx. 600 control subjects were also studied. Results: We found 43 (1.88%) probands with 14 different rare TMPRSS3 variants. We also found a genotype phenotype correlation with truncating mutations causing more severe HI with earlier onset than missense muta tions. The p. A90T variant previously linked with HI had high prevalence in controls (~6%) indicating that is non pathogenic. Conclusions: TMPRSS3 mutations are rare but distinct cause of HI in Polish population. The more severe phenotype associated with truncating mutati ons confirms previous findings.

23271,"Introduction: Usher Syndrome is a rare autosomal recessive disease causing sensorineural hearing loss, retinitis pigmentosa and, sometimes, vestibular dysfunction. It is a genetically heterogeneous disorder, with more than 10 associated genes, being USH2A the most common mutated gene. The recent CRISPR technology is based on a nuclease (Cas9) that cuts the double DNA strand at a specific locus via a guide RNA. Upon cleavage, the target locus undergoes a damage repair either by the error prone nonhomo logous end joining (NHEJ) or the high fidelity homologous recombination (HDR) pathway. Materials and Methods: We have generated different constructs of CRISPR/Cas9 RNA guided nucleases targeted to two prevalent mutations located at exon 13 of the USH2A gene: c.2999delG and p. C759F. These constructs were transfected into HEK293 cells, and each nuclease efficiency was tested by sequencing and also with the T7 endonuclease assay. Later on, we repeated the transfection with the most efficient nuclease tog ether with a template to induce HDR repair. Results: The present study shows the first steps of an approach of gene the rapy based on this CRISPR technology, applied to two characteristic mutati ons responsible for Usher Syndrome. Conclusions: The pathological features of this syndrome represent a great disadvantage for the patients, since communication nowadays relies largely on audiovisual media, and there is still no medical treatment, except for the hearing aids or cochlear implants for the hearing impairment. Therefore, repairing of specific mutations by gene editing is an interesting strategy that can be performed using the CRISPR technology.

Deafblindness is a rare disorder characterized by combination of hearing and visual impairment. Usher and Stickler syndromes are the most frequent gene tic syndromes associated with deafblindness. Usher syndrome is an autosomal recessive disorder responsible for up to 50% cases of hereditary deafblindness.

We describe a case of prenatally detected fetal hyper echogenic kidneys that led to diagnosis of a familial condition. Materials and Methods: A 34 year old primipara was referred to our insti tution due to fetal hyperechogenic kidneys at 24 weeks gestation. Her hus band has mature onset diabetes of the young (MODY).Results: Non invasive prenatal testing (NIPT) showed low risk for aneuplo idy. No other malformations were seen. Fetal ultrasound and MRI were high ly suggestive of bilateral renal dysplasia. Amniocentesis with chromosomal microarray analysis (CMA) revealed a 1.5Mb microdeletion on chromosome 17q12 including the TCF2/HNF1B gene. Chromosome 17q12 microdeletion is a well described contiguous gene deletion syndrome, with variable phe notype. The deletion varies in length but most cases harbor the common 1.5Mb deletion. The TCF2/HNF1B gene is the major causative gene. Features include a wide range of manifestations including neurological, skeletal, hair & nails and endocrine (including MODY). Renal involvement is the hallmark feature, described in over 90% of cases ranging from fetal hyperechogenic or multicystic dysplastic kidneys to pelvic dilatation, recurrent infections and abnormal renal function. Normal kidneys have been described. Parental CMA analysis demonstrated that the deletion was inherited from the father, thus providing a molecular basis for MODY.

Through a collaborative effort of several centers in Europe, we have recently demonstrated digenic inheritance in Alport syndrome identifying combined mutations in collagen IV genes (Mencarelli et al J Med Genet 2015). This result was achieved using an NGS panel covering COL4A3, COL4A4, and CO L4A5 genes. Here, we further expand the evidence for digenic inheritance using an exome sequencing approach. Alport syndrome is characterized by extreme intrafamilial phenotypic variability including the degree of prote inuria. The phenotype of heterozygotes for a single mutation in collagen IV ranges from asymptomatic to overt disease. We selected patients with cli nical evidence of Alport syndrome and typical ultrastructural lesions such as thinning, thickening and splitting of the glomerular basement membra ne. We demonstrated that symptomatic cases with a single mutation in a collagen IV gene are compound heterozygous at either NPHS1 or NPHS2 locus, with at least one allele being hypomorphic. This combination is not present in male Alport patients hemizygous for one pathogenic mutation in COL4A5. According to the strength of NPHS1/NPHS2 mutations, patients manifest variable grade of proteinuria. In order to prove the pathogenic role of identified mutations we are currently using a method recently described (Lazzeri et al. JASN 2015) which allows isolation and long term culture of renal progenitors from fresh urine samples. Overall, on the basis of these results, we can further extend the concept of digenic disease for Alport syn drome which can thus be due to either mutations in two collagen IV genes or mutations in one collagen IV gene and one slit diaphragm gene in the framework of triallelic inheritance.",2015
23278,"Alport Syndrome represents an inherited nephropathy leading to end stage renal disease by the 2nd 3rd decade of life. It is characterized by alterations of the glomerular basement membrane (GBM) and is caused by mutations in collagen IV genes. Although most of the responsible mutations are missense substitutions, a full phenotypic analysis of a knockin mouse model is absent from the literature to date. We herein present preliminary results from the phenotypic analysis of a mouse model carrying the Col4ÃÂ±3 p. G1332E mutation, which is homolo gous to the human COL4A3 p. G1334E mutation representing a frequent founder mutation among Cypriots with thin basement membrane nephro pathy (TBMN).Mutant mice on the 129SvJ background do not develop hematuria but ap pear to develop proteinuria around 17 wk old. Homozygous mutant mice on mixed genetic background exhibit the characteristic Alport GBM ultrastruc tural features, namely irregular thickening, lamellation and podocyte foot process effacement. Furthermore, heterozygous mice demonstrate diffusely thin GBM, which is the main ultrastructural finding in patients with TBMN. Interestingly, kidney immunofluorescence studies using antibodies specific for the Col4ÃÂ±3 and Col4ÃÂ±5 chains, demonstrate increased expression of both collagen chains in mutant GBM as compared to age/sex matched controls. This may explain why these knockin mice live much longer compared to the existing knockout model. The mean survival of the mutant, heterozy gous and wild type mice is 17, 22 and 31 months respectively. The complete phenotypic analysis will enable further clarification of the pathophysiologic mechanisms of Alport syndrome and TBMN and allow the testing of novel therapeutic interventions.

23279,"Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease (ADPKD) is a common (fre quency 1: 1000), adult onset nephropathy accounting for 4 10% of patients requiring dialysis or renal transplant worldwide. Most frequently germli ne mutations in either PKD1 or PKD2 cause ADPKD. However, not only the identification of large ADPKD families unlinked to either gene, but also the lack of PKD1 or PKD2 mutations detected in ~8% of ADPKD families, sug gests further genetic heterogeneity. Until now no additional gene has been identified. We identified a large three generation family with a classical presentation of ADPKD. DNA was available from eight affected and three unaffected relati ves. Mutation analysis of PKD1 and PKD2 ruled out a deleterious mutation in these genes; furthermore, linkage analysis ruled out an association with these loci. Genome wide SNP analysis suggested linkage with a locus of 5 Mb on chromosome 19 (LOD score, 2.3994). Exome sequencing did not reveal a clear deleterious mutation in this family in this region. Since the coverage of several top candidate genes was not sufficient, we are currently screening the coding regions of these genes by next generation sequencing. Further molecular exploration of this family may lead to the identification of a novel gene associated with ADPKD.",2015

As targeted the rapies are emerging, accurate description of ADPKD phenotype is crucial to delineate which patients should, or should not, receive these new treatments. PKD2 phenotype has been described as milder but population based studies, enabling to depict the exact burden of the disease, are currently lacking. We aimed to describe PKD2 mutation spectrum and related phenotype. Between 2010 and 2015, a mutation of PKD2 was identified in 241 patients from the cross sectional Genkyst study (166 pedigrees).The 68 different mutations identified included 23 newly described mutati ons. They spanned on the entire coding region of PKD2 gene and were main ly truncating mutations (84%). A 28 kb deletion involving exons 10 15 was identified in 23 pedigrees confined in an area of ~3500 kmÃÂ², which repre sents the first case of founder mutation in ADPKD. At inclusion, 50 patients had reached end stage renal disease (ESRD), and median age at ESRD (ob tained by Kaplan Meier model) was 77.8 yrs [ranges,41.5 84.6]. Although there was no gender influence on renal survival, multiple linear regression demonstrated that men had significantly lower kidney function than women. Considerable disease variability was observed amongst patients harbouring the same mutation, suggesting that additional genetic or environmental fac tors may modulate the disease severity in PKD2 patients. Consistent with this point, in 3 PKD2 pedigrees with cases of early onset ESRD, disease severity was linked to the co inheritance of hypomorphic alleles of PKD1.

23281,"Biliary atresia (BA) is a rare liver disease presenting within the first months of life characterized by obliteration of the extrahepatic biliary tree in a progressive, necroinflammatory manner, leading to cholestasis, fibrosis, cirrhosis and chronic liver damage, and accounting for 50% of pediatric li ver transplantations in the US. The etiology of BA is not well understood, and environmental, inflammatory, and genetic causes have been proposed. A GWAS in Chinese patients previously identified a signal on chromosome 10q upstream of the ADD3 and XPNPEP1 genes. We performed a GWAS in 450 Caucasian non syndromic BA patients collected through the Childhood Liver Disease Research Network and 1981 controls, with the Illumina Om ni2.5 array. The most significant SNP was rs10865291 (p value , 2.7x10 7; odds ratio 1.6; 95% CI (1.3 1.9)), in the sixth intron of EFEMP1. Efemp1 is an extracellular glycoprotein implicated in tissue regeneration and or ganogenesis. Additionally, we sequenced the exome of 100 patients, and looked for rare variants in 21 genes chosen because of reports of mutations in syndromic BA or animal models with hepatobiliary defects, and BA asso ciation from GWAS. Filtering for protein altering variants present at <1% in public datasets, we found 20 missense variants and 2 in frame insertions in 13 different genes in 26 patients. We found more than one variant in LGR4, ZEB2, DNMT1, INVS, JAG1, and PRICKLE4, some shared among more than one proband. These findings suggest that BA etiology is likely highly hete rogeneous and a single gene does not explain the phenotypic complexity of the disease.",2015
23282,"Introduction: The leading cause of end stage renal disease in children is attributed to congenital anomalies of the kidney and the urinary tract (CA KUT). Familial clustering implicate genetic factors and monogenic mouse models support the involvement of numerous genes in CAKUT aetiology. However, genetic testing for human CAKUT is currently insufficient and ad ditional efforts are needed to identify causal genes. Materials and Methods: We designed a gene panel of 208 genes, which con sists of known genes identified from studies on familial forms of isolated or syndromic CAKUT and candidate genes suggested by in vitro and in vivo mo dels for CAKUT . Targeted next generation sequencing was performed in 458 patients with sporadic CAKUT with a depth of coverage of 135x per sample. Results: Rare (frequency < 0.01), truncating, splice site variants and non synonymous variants predicted to be deleterious and conserved were defi ned as candidates. Based on previous reports on disease causing mutations, we considered 5 variants in 6 patients to be causal mutations and 15 vari ants in 20 patients to be likely pathogenic. However, 32 variants found in 69 patients that were previously reported as pathogenic were reclassified here as variants of uncertain significance. Finally, we identified 128 candidate va riants in 132 patients that were predicted to be loss of function. Conclusions: This study comprises the largest gene set to be analyzed in a cohort of CAKUT patients to date, it demonstrates the advantages of a disea se targeted gene panel, and prioritizes candidate variants identified in 34% of our patient cohort, some of which are currently being followed up using in vitro functional tests.",2015

CAKUT is a genetically highly heterogeneous disorder. To elucidate the gene tic aetiology in unclear cases and identify novel CAKUT genes, we performed whole exome sequencing on peripheral blood from 24 patients (22 spora dic, 2 familial) followed by detailed data analysis. In 12/24 (50%) patients, we found 14 different heterozygous loss of function (LOF) variants in two known dominant CAKUT genes (PAX2 und SALL1) and 11 CAKUT candidate genes, whereby two patients carried two distinct LOF mutations. Four of the 14 LOF variants were de novo, one was inherited from an affected parent, seven were inherited from a healthy parent, and in two cases inheritance was undetermined. In four patients, known CAKUT causing missense muta tions inherited from a healthy parent were detected in the SIX2 (2/24) and the RET (2/24) gene. In 8 patients without LOF variants, heterozygous mis sense variants were determined in CAKUT candidate genes that were novel and predicted to be pathogenic, three of which belonged to the GDNF RET network. In 49 additional CAKUT patients, targeted sequencing of selected candidate genes was performed. One of these genes, in which we detected four rare or novel heterozygous variants including one de novo LOF and three pathogenic missense variants in CAKUT patients, was further ana lysed in vitro and in vivo.

Since 2008, variants in the CTRC gene have been increasingly reported to be associated with chronic pancreatitis. However, to date, all reported CTRC intronic variants have been classified as Ã¢ÂÂunknown significanceÃ¢ÂÂ due to the lack of functional analytic data. During our routine mutational analysis of four pancreatitis genes, PRSS1, SPINK1, CTRC and CFTR, in patients with acute or chronic pancrea titis, we identified two intronic mutations in the CTRC gene, c.357 2A>G in intron 4 and c.640 12G>A in intron 6 (Table), both of which were absent in 350 healthy controls. We performed RT PCR analyses of mRNAs prepa red from cultured lymphocytes of patients I and II (Table), respectively: c.357 2A>G activated a cryptic splice acceptor signal that is located 147 bp upstream of the wild type exon 4 whilst c.640 12G>A created a novel splice acceptor signal 8 bp upstream of the normal one.

CYP21A2 and its highly homologous pseudogene, CYP21A1P , reside within close proximity on 6p21; as a result >90% of CYP21A2 mutation containing alleles are caused by gene conversion events from CYP21A1P or CYP21A2 deletions arising from non allelic homologous recombination. Further, CYP21A2 full gene duplications exist and provide a source of false negative and false positive results as carriers of a CYP21A2 deletion may be masked by a CYP21A2 duplication on the opposite allele (2+0 configuration) or car riers of a point mutation may also carry a second non mutated CYP21A2 in cis.

In a stepwise manner, the capture filter for tar get genes were designed and developed under specific conditions so that whole genome fragment DNA libraries could be set up appropriately. The amplified exomes of target genes were hybridized against the DNA libraries and sequenced subsequently. ResultsWe have enrolled 6 46, XY DSD patients in this study. Targeted smplicons have been generated and are currently under investigation of their capture efficiency. Exome sequencing has been performed with genomic DNA from two of the patients. Potential disease causing variants have been identified. A total of 2 genetic variants were identified and thought as the main cause for DSD. One is a missense mutation F846 on the ATRX gene, while the other one is indel with V176_K177insV on the TSPYL1 gene. Conclusion Finding the causative gene of a heterogenetic disease is challenging even with recent development of NGS and bioinformatics.

Results: Pathway based analysis of the SkM RNA Seq data revealed prefe rential expression of genes involved in cytoskeletal remodeling, including ACTN3, SLC16A3, MYH11, Grem2, MYL6B, MSS51, and MYLPF. Consistent with RNA Seq data, staining of SkM of carriers and non carriers for slow and fast twitch fibers demonstrated higher ratio fast glycolytic fibers in mutation carriers than non carriers (65% vs. 40%). DYRK1B mutation car riers exhibited higher baseline insulin levels (16.7uIU/mL) and compared to non carriers (8.4uIU/mL) and had higher plasma glucose levels in response to oral glucose ingestion that is indicative of insulin resistance in carriers of R102C mutation. Mice overexpressing DYRK1BR102C allele were simi larly insulin resistant. Western blot analysis and Mass Spectrometry of liver proteins illustrated increased expression of G6Pase, PEPCK, Glucokinase, and Pyruvate carboxylase, in mice overexpressing mutant and wild type DYRK1Bcompared to empty vector.

Upon EDN3 treatment, ENCCs rapidly exhibited changes in cell shape and membrane dynamics displaying a sustained grow th and persistence of lamellipodia.

The substitution Arg218Gln, which was in the heterozygous state, was found in two brothers (thirty two and thirty one years old) with a positive family history who suf fered from FSGS. The heterozygous state did not correlate with the rapid progression and early development of the ESRD (twenty seven and thirty one years, respectively), while their father developed ESRD at fifty seven years.

The aim of the present study was to compare global gene expression in ileal biopsies (non inflamed mucosa) from FGDS patients (n,11), unrelated CD patients (n,6) and healthy controls (n,16). We also assessed whether CD genetic risk variants segregate with CD in the FGDS patients. Methods: Global gene expression was examined using Illumina Human HT 12 v4 BeadChip. 140 CD risk variants were genotyped (Immunochip array) and the NOD2 gene was sequenced in 23 adult FGDS patients (7 with CD).Results: Nine metallothioneins were significantly downregulated (1.5 3 fold) in FGDS patients, but not in unrelated CD patients, compared to con trols. The polygenic risk score did not differ significantly between FGDS patients with and without CD. However 6 of the 7 FGDS patients with CD carried NOD2 risk variants, and the two most severely affected patients were homozygous for the rs5743289 risk allele . Three of 16 FGDS patients without CD were heterozygous for NOD2 risk variants Conclusion: Metallothioneins were significantly downregulated in non in flamed terminal ileum of FGDS patients, but not in unrelated CD patients compared to controls.

Mutation analysis of KAL1 and/ or GnRHR was performed by SSCP/DHPLC PCR or by PCR direct DNA se quencing. Results: We found two KAL1 mutations: c.769C>T (p. Arg257*) in a 15 years old anosmic male; and a novel one, an extensive deletion encompassing exons 4 to 14 confirmed by MLPA, in a 3 years old boy (detected also in his mother) with micropenis and maternal family history of HH. Two nIHH male patients were compound heterozygous for GnRHR : c.[2T>C];[785G>A], p.[(M1T)];[(R262Q)] (39 years old, prepubertal testicules, gynecomastia, P1 A0 pilosity) and c.[317A>G];[416G>A], p.[(Q106R);(R139H)] (35 years old with a brother non tested with similar phenotype). All four mutations are known to be disease causative. Discussion: We were able to find the genetic defects in 4 patients. The low detection rate of mutations (8.8%) is related with the existence of several genes implicated in the IHHÃ¢ÂÂ pathogenesis. The NGS analysis in patients with IHH may improve the molecular diagnosis as it allows the screening of diffe rent genes simultaneously.",2015
23296,"Introduction: Genome wide association studies (GWASs) have revealed numerous genomic loci that are associated with complex genetic diseases. Subsequently, many candidate genes have been defined, mainly based on the functional relationships between genes found in the vicinity of the identified loci. However, many of these loci can be linked to regulatory DNA sequences and it is now widely appreciated that part of the GWAS associations is due to sequence variation in regulatory elements. Therefore, the genes controlled by these regulatory elements should be considered as possible candidate genes. Since regulatory elements can regulate genes via chromatin chroma tin interactions that comprise up to 1 Mb, these genes cannot be identified based on base pair distance from the regulatory regions. To address this, we used chromatin conformation capture sequencing (4C seq) to systema tically determine the genes that are physically interacting with regulatory units that overlap the disease associated SNPs in Inflammatory Bowel Di sease (IBD).Results: We assayed chromatin interactions in monocytes, lymphocytes and in DLD 1 cells Ã¢ÂÂ major cell types implicated in IBD pathogenesis. We perfor med 4C seq for 92 IBD associated loci that localize to regulatory elements in all three cell types. Our approach links 815 novel genes, including IL10RA, SMAD5, SMAD6 and PIAS1 , to IBD. Conclusion: We have performed a novel candidate gene approach in which chromatin interaction data on GWAS susceptibility loci are intersected with the information about DNA regulatory elements and gene expression in relevant cell types. This revealed 815 novel candidate genes, consisting of multiple notable genes like SMAD6, IL10RA, PIAS1 and SMAD5, thereby com plementing previously reported candidate gene approaches.",2015
23297,"Johanson Blizzard syndrome (JBS), #243800 is a rare, autosomal recessi ve multisystem disorder characterized by exocrine pancreatic insufficiency and aplasia/hypoplasia of alae nasi. Additional common features include ectodermal dysplasia, hypothyroidism, growth hormone deficiency, senso rineural hearing loss, urogenital and anorectal anomalies and cognitive dys function of variable degrees. Mutations of UBR1 (MIM #605981) are known to cause JBS. The UBR1 represents one of at least four E3 ubiquitin ligases of the N end rule pathway, an evolutionary conserved and ubiquitously ex pressed intracellular proteolytic pathway involved in ubiquitin mediated degradation of many proteins. JBS has wide and highly variable clinical ma nifestation with rare malformations observed in some patients with mole cularly confirmed JBS. We report a newborn Omani with JBS and a novel truncating mutation in UBR1 . The clinical features include a beaked nose, hypoplasia of nasal wings, exocrine pancreatic insufficiency presenting with severe failure to thrive and septicemic shock, severe anemia requiring fre quent blood transfusion, anal atresia, sparse hair, scalp defect, lumbosacral meningo myelocele and hydrocephalus. This is a second report of neural tube defect in association with JBS implying that this association is as a re sult of UBRI mutation rather than coincidental. The phenotypic defects in JBS involve several organ systems in addition to pancreas suggesting that UBR1 mediated protein degradation plays a critical role at certain stages of human development, and in specific cell types.",2015
23298,"Background: About a quarter of patients with end stage renal disease (ESRD) before age 30 do not have a primary renal disease diagnosis. Previous gene tic studies have focused on specific clinical diagnoses. We took an innovative approach by sequencing a panel of 399 renal disease genes in 200 cases with ESRD onset before age 30, regardless of their clinical diagnosis. Data for the first 132 cases are presented. Methods: We designed the Ã¢ÂÂRENomeÃ¢ÂÂ using SureSelect/Agilent with 399 genes involved in hereditary renal disease. We used SOLiDÃ¢ÂÂ¢ 5500XL for se quencing and an in house developed bioinformatics pipeline for mapping, variant calling and QC. Variants were annotated using CARTAGENIA softwa re. Results: On average >95% of in target bases were genotyped, with >99% sensitivity and specificity. Stringent filtering criteria allowed only for coding variants with percentage variant reads of >15%, novel or with allele fre quency of <0.005, that were listed as disease causing in HGMD Pro, had a SIFT score <0.05 and were not predicted to be benign in PolyPhen2. We also selected samples with likely CNVs. Extended analyses, with less stringent filtering criteria and in depth copy number analyses, are presented at the meeting. Conclusion: This filtering strategy yielded a molecular diagnosis in 15 pati ents (11.4%), confirming the registered primary disease in 6, and unexpec tedly reclassifying it in 9. Considering the stringency of filtering, these num bers underestimate the diagnostic potential of our innovative approach. Ad ding early RENome sequencing to the diagnostic work up in all young ESRD patients, improves etiologic classification and genetic counseling.

23299,"Introduction: The killer cell immunoglobulin like receptors (KIRs) form a group of regulatory molecules that specifically recognize HLA class I mole cules. The aim of this study was to analyze the possible association of spe cific KIR genes and KIR/HLA C genotypes with the susceptibility to CrohnÃ¢ÂÂs disease (CD) in a Spanish population. Materials and Methods: A total of 125 patients with RA and 339 healthy control subjects were selected for this study based on clinical criteria. The commercial KIR SSO typing kit from Luminex (Tepnel Lifecodes) was used to investigate KIR and HLA C typing. Results: The centromeric A/A genotype was more frequent in CD patients (P<10 3). When we included HLA C analysis, we found that the centromeric A/A genotype and HLA C1 combination was significantly increased in CD patients (P<10 3). Moreover, KIR2DL2/2DL3 genotype demonstrated a de creased frequency in CD patients (P<0.0005), whereas the KIR2DL3/2DL3 genotype was significantly increased in CD patients (P<0.0005). Remarkab ly, we also observed a highly significant increase of the KIR2DL3/KIR2DL3 HLAC1/HLAC1 homozygosis in CD patients (P<0.0005).Conclusion: Our results confirm the relevance of the KIR2DL2/KIR2DL3 genes and their interaction with HLA C in CD. The presence of a particular KIR HLA pair may confer functional competence on NK cells and influences differences in NK cell functional responses among individuals. We show that the contribution of the KIR genes to CD susceptibility extends beyond the association with individual KIRs, with an imbalance between activating and inhibitory KIR genes seeming to influence the susceptibility to CD.

23301,"Single gene disorders are estimated to account for ~30% of children and ~10% of adult patients attending renal outpatient services. In the Rad boudumc a multidisciplinary nephrogenetic outpatient clinic for children and adult patients with (genetic) kidney diseases has been established by a team of (pediatric) nephrologists and a clinical geneticist. Clinical exome sequencing for a broad spectrum of isolated and syndromic renal (ciliary) disorders has been developed. The approach consists of a two tier analysis in which the first step is to screen for pathogenic variants in genes that are known to be mutated in renal diseases (170 genes) or (renal) ciliopathies (125 genes). If causative mutations are not identified in the first step, the complete exome data set can be analysed with informed consent. The first results with the renal disease gene panel in 63 unrelated patients with un diagnosed renal disease led to pathogenic mutations in nine cases (14%), and in 11 other cases (17%) likely pathogenic variants needed follow up studies. Further analysis of the complete exome data set in 17 patients, revealed novel candidate genes in two cases that are under investigation. In addition, copy number variation analysis of exome data revealed a pa thogenic deletion of the NPHP1 gene in two cases, confirming the clinical diagnosis. We conclude that the combination of the multidisciplinary out patient clinic with diagnostic exome sequencing provides a powerful tool for detecting causative mutations in up to 23 out of 63 patients (35%) with a renal disease.",2015

The KOUNCIL consortium is a collaboration between the UMC Ut recht, the Radboudumc Nijmegen and UC London aimed at elucidating the genetic etiology and pathophysiological mechanisms underlying nephro nophthisis and identifying drugs that prevent renal failure. Our goal is to improve early genome diagnostics, genetic counseling and therapeutic op tions for nephronophthisis patients. Methods We employ next generation sequencing to identify novel disease genes in 100 nephronophthisis pati ents included within the AGORA biobank project. The functional effect of novel mutations is assessed using in vitro and in vivo models. Genotypic and phenotypic patient characteristics are registered in a nephronophthi sis database, facilitating correlation analyses and the identification of early phenotypic markers. Newly identified genes are incorporated into a diagno stic targeted next generation sequencing panel of ciliary genes. We use a systems biology approach to identify and functionally characterize nephro nophthisis associated protein modules. Finally, we use high throughput repurposing screens in zebrafish embryos to discover drugs that halt pro gression of renal failure. Results We expect to uncover the causal mutation in 60 90% of nephronophthisis patients. KOUNCIL members were involved in the identification of three novel genes (IFT172 , WDR34 and WDR60 ) for nephronophthisis related disorders. Clinical guidelines and new diagnostic tools for nephronophthisis are developed and implemented in genome dia gnostics.

23303,"r.o., Prague, Czech Republic, 22nd Department of Pediatrics, Comenius University Medical School and University ChildrenÃÂ´s Hospital, Bratislava, Slovakia. Introduction: Mutations in the PKHD1 gene cause autosomal recessive poly cystic kidney disease (ARPKD). The PKHD1 gene is located on chromosome 6 and consists of 68 exons. The incidence of ARPKD is approximately 1:30 000. Some newborns with ARPKD die due to insufficiently developed lungs. In those who survive, the disease is manifested by backbone and limb de formations, unusual facial features and distended abdomen. Kidney function deteriorates progressively towards renal failure. Fortunately, dialysis and transplantation can extend patientsÃ¢ÂÂ lifespan. Materials and Methods: The analysis of the PKHD1 gene was carried out by next generation sequencing (GS Junior, Roche). In house designed primers were used for amplicon preparation. Amplicons cover all coding exons and exon intron boundaries. Universal design for library preparation was used. Results: DNA samples of eleven unrelated patients with symptoms of ARPKD were analysed. Thr36Met a heterozygous mutation causal for ARPKD was identified in five samples. This mutation was accompanied by the second heterozygous mutation in all five cases. Those five mutations have been pre viously described in literature in patients with ARPKD, namely Arg92Trp, Gly112Arg, Leu2128Ter, Ile2331Lys and Ile2957Thr. In addition, heterozy gous mutations one considered as deleterious Gly1712Arg and one novel Gln1122Ser were found in one sample. In five samples we did not find any deleterious or suspicious mutations. Conclusion: Our method allows reliable analysis of the PKHD1 gene to be achieved in a few days. To assess the clinical significance of novel mutations, it is necessary to analyze the PKHD1 gene in the individual members of pa tientsÃ¢ÂÂ families.",2015

In addition to recessive ARPKD, 2 5% of patients with dominant ADPKD show early and severe disease. Genetic testing is cumbersome because of the size and structure of major disease genes and increasing genetic heterogeneity. We established a novel custo mized sequence capture based NGS panel for PKD that currently targets 95 genes. In total, we analysed a cohort of 308 patients with early and severe PKD. The majority of patients carried mutations in PKD1, PKD2, and PK HD1 , however a subgroup harboured mutations in genes typically related to other ciliopathies such as nephronophthisis, Joubert, Meckel, and Bardet Biedl syndrome. We demonstrate that PKD1 is a driver for early and seve re manifestations in families with dominant ADPKD. Notably, mutations in both ADPKD genes can also be identified in patients with recessive PKD. A proportion of patients carry aggravating mutations in more than just one single gene/allele in the context of a functionally proven dosage sensitive network. Zebrafish and Xenopus are used as models for validation of some of our findings. This is the most comprehensive study performed so far by which we propose a dosage sensitive model for early and severe forms of PKD. Our NGS panel allows the parallel analysis of all disease genes inclu ding the pseudogene variable PKD1 gene which plays a decisive role in cyst initiation.

We revisited clinical records of 89 non syndromic type III BA patients with median follow up of 17.20 years, which revealed that 41.57% BAs were affected with chronic extra hepatic diseases, with high prevalence of autoimmune allergic diseases (22.47%) and Glucose 6 phosphate dehy drogenase deficiency (14.29% of the males). After genotyping on the geno me wide Affymetrix5.0 array, we shortlisted 29 Ã¢ÂÂBA CNVsÃ¢ÂÂ found in BA pati ents but not in the general population, and collated 103 BA associated genes from a gene based genome wide association analysis on common variants, for downstream analysis. In BA CNVs we discovered three categories of ge notype phenotype correlations: i) two de novo BA CNVs, perturbing genes/chromosome segments known to BA, correlated with BA; ii) three BA CNVs encompassing genes known to immunity defects, correlated with comorbi dities of those immune disorders in 3 carriers; iii) importantly, genes af fected by BA CNVs (N,102; gene set 1) were enriched with immune genes, correlated with the high prevalence of immunity disorders in BA. Further, we proved significant connectivity between gene set 1 and genes tagged by common variants (N,103; gene set 2) (Empirical p,0.039). As multiple function modules were elucidated in topological analysis of the BA candi date gene network, a Ã¢ÂÂcoreÃ¢ÂÂ position of cellular signalling pathways, which affect inflammatory and immunity regulation pathways, was highlighted.

23306,"To date, mutations in over 50 genes have been published as underlying different cases of Steroid Resistant Nephrotic Syndrome (SRNS). SRNS is a molecularly heterogeneous condition but, in all cases, the underlying insult results in malfunction of the kidneyÃ¢ÂÂs Glomerular Filtration Barrier (GFB) resulting in protein loss into the urine. CD2AP was first proposed as a site of dominant mutations underlying SRNS in 2003. This was supported by histo logical features of renal disease in heterozygous loss of function mouse mu tants and a heterozygous splice site variant observed in two renal disease patients. Since then, further disease relevant alleles have been reported and the screening of CD2AP has been added to clinical protocols. The advent of next generation sequencing technologies and the discovery of other causal genes questions whether mutations in CD2AP alone are suf ficient to cause SRNS. Here, we present data on CD2AP variants found from whole exome sequencing of over 200 SRNS patients and 1500 controls. We show that several alleles previously described as disease causing are ob served in our control population. In addition, whilst we observe rare alle les in CD2AP in two of our cases, in each of these individuals, we observe other rare alleles in other SRNS genes that are predicted to be functionally relevant. These observations demonstrate the challenges in determining the pathogenicity of individual variants in the absence of complete data.

Ultrastructural examination of the renal biopsy showed glomerular base ment membrane (GBM) thinning and thickening with atypical electron den se bodies. Detachment of GBM from podocytes was compatible with focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS). Pathogenic mutations in the COL4A5 , COL4A4 and COL4A3 genes were excluded by direct sequencing of all exons and by MLPA of COL4A5 . Subsequently, whole exome sequencing was perfor med in the proband, using the Illumina HiSeq2000 platform and filtering the variants on genes encoding podocyte products. Two substitutions, c.686G>A (p.(Arg229Gln)) and c.928G>A (p.(Glu310Lys)), were detected in the NPHS2 gene, in compound heterozygosity in the affected sisters, confirming the dia gnosis of autosomal recessive nephrotic syndrome type 2 and supporting genetic counselling in this family. FSGS is a glomerular lesion that results from podocyte detachment or death, clinically presenting with proteinuria and progressing to renal failure. It can have multiple primary or secondary causes, including monogenic disorders. Although typical ultrastructural GBM changes are seen in Alport syndrome (as alternating thinning and thik kening, lamellation and the presence of electron dense bodies), FSGS may be observed in later stages of the disease.

Immu nofluorescence analyses confirmed the down regulated expression of some of these genes, in particular of the cartilage oligomeric matrix protein and osteopontin, encoded by COMP and SPP1, respectively, and showed the pre dominant reduction and disassembly of the heparan sulfate specific GAGs, as well as of the PG perlecan and type III and V collagens. The key role of GalT II in GAG synthesis and the crucial biological functions of PGs are consi stent with the perturbation of many physiological functions that are critical for the correct architecture and homeostasis of various connective tissues, including skin, bone, cartilage, tendons, and ligaments, and generates the wide phenotypic spectrum of GalT II deficient patients.",2015
23314,"Introduction: Osteoporosis is a progressive multifactorial skeletal disease characterised by low bone mass thereby increasing fracture susceptibility. The Receptor activator of nuclear factor Kappa B (RANK) is involved in the regulation of osteoclastogenesis via the RANK RANK ligand Osteoprotege rin pathway. The influence of two polymorphisms rs3018362 (A>G) and rs884205 (G>T) in the 3Ã¢ÂÂ untranslated region of this gene were analysed in relation to bone mineral density (BMD) and different low trauma fractures in Maltese postmenopausal women. Materials and Methods: 1045 women were recruited and subdivided in three BMD control groups if without a fracture history: normal, osteopenic or osteoporotic. Cases were women who suffered any type of low trauma fracture. Genotyping of the rs3018362 polymorphism was performed by po lymerase chain reaction and restriction enzyme digest, whereas real time PCR was used for the rs884205 variant. Odds ratios were computed using logistic regression analysis adjusted for age and clinical risk factors. Results: Homozygosity for the rs3018362 G allele was associated with a low femoral neck BMD (Adjusted OR,2.2 [95% confidence interval 1.1 5.1], p,0.02), and to a lower extent reduced lumbar spine BMD (OR,1.9 [1.1 3.4], p,0.04) relative to research subjects with a normal BMD. Cases carrying two copies of the minor allele T for the rs884205 variant had an increased fracture risk (OR,2.6 [1.1 7.1], p,0.04), especially that of the hip (OR,3.2 [1.2 8.0], p,0.02) and humerus (OR,2.9 [1.1 7.9], p,0.04). Haplotype based analysis revealed that the alleles were not in linkage disequilibrium. Conclusion: RANK gene polymorphisms predispose to reduced BMD or in creased fracture susceptibility in Maltese postmenopausal women. ABSTRACTS POSTERS ESHG 2015 | GLASGOW, SCOTLAND, UK | WWW. ESHG.

The fingers show absent flexion and extension creases over the proximal interphalangeal joints. There is no limitation of movement. Radiological ex amination at birth showed absent ossification of the preaxial metacarpals and metatarsals. In addition abnormal or absent ossification of the proximal and middle phalanges of the 3rd 5th fingers and absent ossification of the proxi mal and middle phalanges of the 2nd 5th toe was seen.

23316,"Introduction: Autosomal dominant brachydactyly type E (BDE) is a conge nital limb malformation characterized by small hands and feet as a result of shortened metacarpals and metatarsals. BDE can be isolated or asso ciated with a syndrome, and in most cases, the genetic cause of BDE remains unknown. One of the genes associated to syndromic BDE is PTHLH, the gene coding for parathyroid hormone related protein (PTHrP), implicated in the regulation of the balance between chondrocyte proliferation and the onset of hypertrophic differentiation during endochondral bone development. Haploinsufficiency of PTHLH has been reported as the cause of BDE, mostly associated to short stature in 6 families. Subjects and Methods: We report a family case with BDE, short stature and apparently breast hypoplasia in the daughter; and an isolated case, presen ting with isolated BDE. PTHLH gene coding exons and coding exon intron joints of all transcripts were analysed by direct sequencing. Results: The sequencing of PTHLH gene revealed two intragenic deletions affecting the splicing (47_101+73del128 and c.101+3AAGT) as the cause of the syndrome. Both mutations are predicted to cause a mistake in the spli cing, resulting in an aberrant mRNA, which will be degraded by nonsense mediated decay and produce haploinsufficiency of the PTHrP in both pati ents. Conclusion: This is the third report on PTHLH mutations leading to BDE re vealing that the spectrum of symptoms is wider than previously described.

A single episo de of pneumonia at 3 y was reported. On examination, tinea manuum and, a few minutes after water exposure, a rapid onset of a papillomatous me dio palmar swelling was observed. Her growth parameters were normal without any chest deformity. Her sinus X rays indicates absence of nasal polyps. A diagnosis of aquagenic palmoplantar keratoderma (APK) was made. A sweat test indicated chloride concentrations of 64 mmol/l and 51 mmol/l (N<60). Since APK has been already reported in association with clinical cystic fibrosis and/or CFTR mutations, next generation sequencing of CFTR was undertaken and identified a combination of apparent homozy gosity for a missense CFTR RD mutation c.2855T>C (p. Met952Thr), already described in congenital bilateral absence of vas deferens, and a large hete rozygous deletion encompassing CFTR exons 16 to 20, described as c.2620 674_3367+198del9855 known as CF pathogenic mutation. Based on these results, we confirm the existence of a link between isolated APK and CFTR mutations and suggest to include this phenotype (APK only) at the mild end of CFTR clinical spectrum. Owing to the small number of CFTR related APK cases reported sofar, we are unable to conclude on the importance of CFTR mutation negative APK. This observation also suggests that screening for rare CFTR mutations should be systematically proposed in case of isolated APK in order to provide appropriate genetic counseling.",2015

Amerindian ancestry was identified as a risk factor. We aimed the identification of autosomal genomic regions that may contribute to CLÃÂ±P in this probably more homogeneous popu lation. Method: The study sample included 30 families with isolated CLÃÂ±P (31 affected and 113 total individuals). They were genotyped on the Affymetrix Genome Wide 6.0 array. We calculated linkage disequilibrium (LD) between each pair of SNPs into a window of 50 SNPs, shifting the window 5 SNPs forward and repeating the procedure to scan all autosomes. Then we pruned the data removing one SNP of each pair that was in strong LD (r >0.8). We performed a segmentation analysis to obtain genomic regions significantly associated with CLÃÂ±P . We identified ge nomic segments of a maximum length of 250Kb with more than one SNP with p value less than 0.001.Results: A total of 14 genomic segments with two or more independent SNPs si gnificantly associated with CLÃÂ±P were identified. A segment of 61.3Kb on 8q12.1 containing FAM110B gene showed the most significant association with CLÃÂ±P (p, 0.00007). Other segment of 25.5Kb on 3q29 significantly associated with CLÃÂ±P (p,0.0002) was close to the FGF12 gene that was previously associated with oral cleft phenotype in other populations. Conclusion: Our results suggest FAM110B on 8q12.1 as a new candidate gene to CLÃÂ±P . The region on 3q29 near FGF12 gene should be more investigated because previous associations with CLÃÂ±P .

Often, it is associated with cleft palate, Pierre Robin sequence and deafness. KD is caused by a mutation in the COL2A1 gene encoding type II collagen. Here we describe two affected siblings born to a phenotypically normal Saudi Arab first cousins couple. They were born with prominent eyes, cleft soft palate, micrognathia, midfacial hypoplasia, knee joint contracture, and short lower limbs (birth length was 43 cm). Both developed severe myopia which progressed to left sided retinal detachment in the younger affected sister at 4 years of age, hearing impairment, disproportionate short stature, barrel shaped chest, thoracolumbar kyphoscoliosis, knee and hip joint fle xion contractures, and bowed legs.

Cutis laxa and the dermatosparaxis and classic EDS types were excluded for the peculiar clinical presentation of the patient, not yet described to our know ledge. Furthermore, mutational screening of the ADAMTS2 , COL5A1 and COL5A2 genes did not reveal causal mutations.

Introduction: The molecular mechanisms underlying nonsyndromic cra niosynostosis (NSC) are still largely unknown. Recent evidence obtained thorugh GWAS on a large cohort of patients indicated the significant associa tion of sagittal NSC to the Bardet Biedl Syndrome associated gene 9 (BBS9). BBS9 is involved in the formation of the primary cilium. Preliminary data demonstrated that cells isolated from prematurely fused sutures of midline NSC patients display aberrant BBS9 expression and reduced number of pri mary cilia, affecting the cell osteogenic potential. This study was aimed at characterizing the BBS9 gene as associated to midline NSC. Methods: Calvarial derived mesenchymal cells (CMSC) were isolated from fused and patent sutures of NSC patients. The expression of BBS9 was ana lyzed through qPCR, both in fused and patent samples. The BBS9 gene was silenced by siRNA in fused CMSC, the effect of gene modulation on cilioge nesis was analyzed by immunofluorescence. Results: BBS9 level was higher in fused CMSC compared to controls. Confo cal microscopy showed that fused CMSC display a predisposition to produce differently shaped and developed primary cilia. 48 hours of siRNA treatment efficiently reduced the BBS9 level and affected the ciliogenesis, restoring a phenotype like patent CMSC. Conclusions: These data confirmed the association between BBS9 expres sion and aberrant ciliogenesis, suggesting that the dysregulation of primary cilium and its related signaling could underlie the alterated osteogenic pro cess occurring at the site of premature synostosis in NSC.

23324,"Craniosynostosis is a common congenital malformation in which one or more of the cranial sutures of an infant skull fuse prematurely. Sagittal non syndromic craniosynostosis (sNCS) has an estimated prevalence of ~2 per 10,000 live births. Our recent GWAS study identified robust associations to locus on chromosome 20 that is 345kb 3Ã¢ÂÂ of BMP2 . We did not identify any coding BMP2 variant, suggesting that variants in the associated region near BMP2 may harbor regulatory elements responsible for the phenotype. To test this we monitored the expression of BMP2 in primary calvarial osteo blasts from sNCS patients. We observed overexpression of BMP2 and heigh tened BMP2 signaling in 2 out of 8 osteoblast cell lines. In order to deter mine if rs1884302 variation causes functional changes, a 716 bp fragment was cloned into a zebrafish enhancer detector (ZED) vector with the wild type allele (T) or the risk allele (C). Zebrafish transgenesis carried out with both fragments resulted in a strong expression of green fluorescent protein (GFP) in the head of the transgenic fish with a C, but not with the T alllele of rs1884302. Our in vitro results suggest that overexpression of BMP2 by altered regulatory activity near this gene contributes to the etiology of sNSC, while in vivo results indicate that the differences in regulatory activity are dependent on the C or the T allele.",2015
23325,"Craniosynostosis is a human disease condition, in which premature fusion of cranial sutures results in prominent skull deformations. Genetic triggers for these disorders are numerous and are mostly linked to mutations in well described developmental genes, like FGFR3 and TWIST1. To investigate the function of novel or so far ill described genes causing craniosynostosis, a reliable animal model is needed, allowing in vivo investigations of skull de velopment over time and genetic engineering. Besides mouse, the zebrafish (Danio rerio) has become a good choice to study such complex developmen tal processes in a vertebrate model system. We performed initial investigations of normal cranial suture development in zebrafish with different techniques and found promising similarities to hu man cranial development. Especially non invasive techniques open up the possibility to repeatedly investigate cranial structures over time in single in dividuals. Conservation of gene expression patterns of craniosynostosis as sociated genes in zebrafish hint to the notion that a similar genetic network is established in both species to form sutures. To decipher this network in more detail, we used gene expression analyses and different transgenic re porter lines for visualization of cellular processes. To furthermore conduct functional studies, we introduced site specific genomic alterations in the homologue of TCF12 via CRIPSR/Cas9.

23326,"Background: Acrodermatitis enteropathica (AE; MIM #201100) is a rare and severe autosomal recessive zinc deficiency disorder caused by a bialle lic anomaly of zinc transporter gene SLC39A4. It is characterized chiefly by acral and periorificial dermatitis occurring either in the perinatal period, or at weaning in breast fed children. Its clinical diagnosis has to be necessarily confirmed by a genetic testing, as it may be misdiagnosed as various skin diseases ranging from relatively common ones to rare ones. Our present study is based on an Iranian inbred family with four living members having clinical symptoms suggestive of AE, albeit exhibiting no mutations either in SLC39A4 or in nearly 50 genes directly involved in zinc homeostasis. Purpose: Our goal was to determine the genetic cause of the AE like geno dermatosis observed in this multiplex family. Method: Whole exome sequencing was performed in nine of the family members, including three affected and six unaffected ones. Results: An exceedingly rare variant was found in the promoter of DSP (desmoplakin gene), which creates an alternative initiation codon. The de leterious effect of this variant was assessed by immunohistochemical and functional studies using luciferase based assays. This result allowed us to diagnose Carvajal syndrome (MIM #605676), that is a rare autosomal re cessive form of palmoplantar keratoderma associated with wooly hair, and with dilated cardiomyopathy, which last symptom was not observed in our patients. Conclusions: This case not only illustrates the difficulty to recognize AE ba sing on clinical symptoms and pathology only, but it also emphasizes the usefulness of whole exome sequencing in its differential diagnosis from other syndromes with overlapping features.",2015

Eleven patients are without causal mutations despite that all known genes up to now associated with EB were analysed. Totally, mutations were identified in 128 probands (92%). Conclusion: Besides identification of the spectra of mutations in Czech EB patients, the study present new method implemented into genetic diagno stics of genodermatoses in the Czech Republic sequence capture and tar geted resequencing that provides more complete diagnosis than a classical gene by gene approach. Parallel analysis of known genes in a patient (or in multiple patients) enables fast and cost effective identification of gene mutations. Currently, we are able to perform analysis of 81 genes associated with different inherited skin disorders. Supported by IGA MZÃÂR NT14585 3 and TAÃÂR TE02000058.",2015
23333,"Introduction: The differential diagnosis of achondroplasia and hypochon droplasia in Ukraine is based on the typical clinical and radiologic features that limits accurate diagnosis and leads to many false positive diagnoses when checked against a complete mutation search of the FGFR3 gene. The reby, we outline the necessity of implementation molecular genetic test of FGFR3 gene mutations. The implementation is necessary to carry out diffe rential and prenatal diagnostic of achondroplasia and hypochondroplasia among Ukrainian population. Materias and Methods: The study included 61 patients with clinical things of achondroplasia or hypochondroplasia and 94 relatives including sibs and parents. The molecular genetic analysis was performed by PCR (Polymera se Chain Reaction) and RFLP (Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism) analysis. We optimized the time and temperature conditions and chose spe cific primers for revealing the c.1138G>A, c.1138G>C and p. Asn540Lys mu tations of FGFR3 gene. Results: Mutation c.1138G>A was found at 22 (36%) individuals aged from 5 months to 40 years old with obvious phenotypical features of achondro plasia of which 20 cases was sporadic. Additionally the mutation c.1138G>C was detected at 3 (5%) probands. Major p. Asn540Lys mutation of the FGFR3 receptor was identified at 3 (5%) probands which causes hypochondropla sia. Conclusions: We concluded that 98% of mutations were sporadic because no mutations were found at relatives; meanwhile we found one (1.6%) in heritable c.1138G>A mutation at both mother and son. Due to conducting of molecular genetic diagnostics of FGFR3 mutations c.1138G>A, c.1138G>C and p. Asn540L diagnosis achondroplasia and hypochondroplasia were con firmed at 26 (43%) observed patients and extensive gene analysis are re quired for the other patients to search for rare FGFR3 rearrangements.",2015
23334,"Fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva (FOP) is a rare congenital disorder characterized by progressive heterotopic ossification. During the disea se course FOP patients present soft tissue lumps as a result of inflamma tion induced flare ups preceding the irreversible replacement of skeletal muscle tissue with bone tissue. Classical FOP patients possess a mutation (c.617G>A; R206H) in the activin receptor IA (ACVR1) encoding gene. No netheless, disease progression in FOP patients with this mutation varies which indicates a strong contribution by environmental factors. Our objec tive was to study the process of osteogenic differentiation in primary der mal fibroblasts from five FOP patients based on a novel method of growth factor induced osteogenic transdifferentiation. In all patients the classical FOP mutation was confirmed. The osteogenic properties of the cells were evaluated by the mRNA expression of Runt related transcription factor 2 (Runx2), alkaline phosphatase (Alp), osteocalcin (OC) and the presence of mineralization by alizarin red staining. Given the pro inflammatory role of TGFÃÂ², we performed pharmacological inhibition of TGFÃÂ² signaling by the TGFÃÂ² type I receptor inhibitor GW788388. During osteogenic transdifferen tiation the expression of Runx2 and Alp over time was higher in FOP cell li nes compared to heathy controls (Runx2:p,0.001; Alp:p>0.05). All cell lines exhibited increase in mineralization. Addition of the inhibitor to the osteo genic media resulted in the attenuation of osteogenic differentiation shown by the decrease in expression of osteogenic markers in patients vs untreated cells (Runx2:p,0.045) and mineralisation. We suggest that TGFÃÂ² is involved in the molecular pathway of flare up induced ossification. Inhibition of this pathway may limit ectopic ossification in FOP .",2015
23335,"We report the case of a 35 years old man, referred for genetic counseling because of cleft palate and limb malformations. The family history was un remarkable. He was son of healthy non consanguineous parents, born at 40 weeks of gestation. Pregnancy was complicated by threatened miscarriage. At birth, clinical evaluation showed cleft palate and presence of multiple malformations of limbs. Hands and foots showed agenesis of some fingers, with syndactyly and complex brachydactyly. Upper limbs were normal. Right femur was hypoplastic with agenesis of the right fibula, brevity and deformation of the proximal epiphysis of the tibia. Other associated anoma lies were scoliosis and hypoplasia of the pelvis . Growth and psychomotor development were normal. Complementary investigations including eye fundus, abdominal, renal and cardiac ultrasound examinations and auditory evoked potentials were normal. This syndrome is apparently distinct from other previously described conditions exhibiting fibular agenesis/hypopla sia, because of the association of fibula aplasia/hypoplasia, cleft palate and oligo brachy syndactyly of hands and foots is extremely rare. Figuera et al. (1993) reported a girl with fibular agenesis, together with radial shortening and coalescence of the tarsal bones, telecanthus, flat nasal bridge, retrogna tia, cleft palate and oligo polydactyly. This syndrome has been described as Ã¢ÂÂOral facial digital syndrome with fibular aplasiaÃ¢ÂÂ. Some defects are in com mon with our case, such as the occurrence of cleft palate and fibular aplasia, but in OFD syndrome polydactyly is present, that is absent in our patient. Since this combination has not been described previously, we suggest a di stinct new variant of this syndrome.",2015

Genetic factors play an important role in regulating bone mineral density (BMD) and susceptibility to non verte bral fractures, but there is little information on the genetic determinants of CVF. Here we report the results of a genome wide association study to iden tify loci that predispose to CVF, involving 1634 postmenopausal female CVF cases (from 11 centres in Europe and Australia) and 4662 controls, matched for region and gender. Genotyping was performed using the Illumina OmniX array and standard quality control measures were applied. Each cohort was analysed separately and results were combined using inverse variance me ta analysis. Replication was sought in 634 CVF cases and 2150 controls. We identified seven loci suggestively associated with CVF (p values,2.02x10 5 3.35x10 7) and one locus on chromosome 2q13 significantly associated with CVF (p,2.42x10 8, OR,1.7 [95%CI 1.42 2.09]). The loci are distinct from those previously identified as genetic risk factors for osteoporosis. We went on to study mRNA expression of candidate genes in the 2q13 locus in transiliac bone biopsies from normal and osteoporotic women. Four genes showed reduced levels of expression in osteoporotic patients (ANAPC1, SL C20A1, TMEM87B, ZC3H6) and two showed increased expression (MERTK, ZC3H8).

Some cases are isolated , inherited dominantly or may be a symptom with variety malformation syndroms Beckwith Wiedemann (BWS), Sotos, Silver Russell (SRS), Proteus. It is well documented that children with HH and/or BWS have an increased risk up to 10% of developing embryonal neo plasms, including nephroblastoma, hepatoblastoma, etc. Aim. To present two unrelated paediatric patients with typical features of asymmetric body overgrowth, diagnosed HH and embryonal neoplasms. Case descriptions. The first patient a girl, body asymmetry was detected at the age of 3 months and as her mother had also HH, autosomal dominant HH was diagnosed and the regular surveillance focusing to embryonal tu mors was recommended.

In IP patients the skin defects are hallmarks of the disease, while the extra cutaneous defects (ocular, dental, hair, nail and central nervous system CNS) are present at variable frequency. In 30% of IP patients CNS defects are ob served, and the phenotype severity is variable. Moreover, it does not corre late with the genetic alteration in IP locus. Indeed, even when the common deletion is present (NEMOdel4_10 deletion) a wide range of CNS symptoms can occur, from neonatal seizures to severe mental retardation. To evaluate the contribution of modifier genes on the variability of the IP intellectual disabilities we investigated the genomic background in three selected IP cases carrying the NEMOdel4_10 deletion and severe mental retardation: one was a familial case and two were sporadic cases. Whole exome sequencing of trios samples was performed. From sequencing of an exome enriched library a list of single nucleotide/indels variants was pro duced. By applying combined filtering method with the information related to the inheritance of the variants, we identified candidate genes by selecting those variants fitting to recessive model of inheritance and damaging by bio informatics analysis. Candidate genes were associated to cobalamin and folate pathways sugge sting that a masked metabolic defect underlines the IP clinical phenotype.

It is characterized by rapid growth, associated osseous hyper plasia and high recurrence rate after surgical intervention. Also premature dental eruption and regional macrodontia have been described. In 2014 Maclellan et al. identified causal missense mutations in PIK3CA in affected tissue samples of patients with this disorder. The phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase (PI3K)/AKT signaling pathway is critical for cellular growth and metabolism and activating mutations in AKT1, AKT2, or AKT3 have been found in distinct disorders featuring overgrowth. PIK3CA encodes the p110ÃÂ± catalytic subunit of PI3K. Several PIK3CA related syndromes with segmental overgrowth have been described before, like MCAP syndrome (Megalencephaly Capillary Malfor mations), Hemimegalencephaly, CLOVES syndrome (Congenital Lipomatous asymmetric Overgrowth of the trunk, Vascular malformations, Epidermal nevi, Skeletal and Spinal anomalies) and FH (fibroadipose hyperplasia). Because even more clinical entities were shown to be caused by PIK3CA mutations, the name Ã¢ÂÂPIK3CA Related Overgrowth Spectrum (PROS)Ã¢ÂÂ was suggested. Almost all cases are caused by postzygotic (mosaic) mutations in one allele of the PIK3CA gene. We report a patient who presented with asymmetry of the face, with hyper trophy of the right cheek and hemihypertrophy of the tongue. Segmental neurofibromatosis was suspected, but after a biopsy no Schwann cells were found, but only fat cells and fibroblasts, leading to the diagnosis of Conge nital infiltrating lipomatosis of the face.

Malignant hyperthermia (MH) is potentially fatal pharmacogenetic disor der in which intracellular calcium homeostasis in the skeletal muscle of susceptible individuals is disrupted upon exposure to halogenated anae sthetics, suxamethonium, or both. MH is linked to the ryanodine receptor (RYR1) on chromosome 19 and the ÃÂ±1S subunit of the voltage dependent L type calcium channel (CACNA1S) on chromosome 1. Molecular diagnosis of MH is essential for provision of genetic counseling and to establish cas cade screening in MH families.

A NGS based workflow was designed using capture library to target the coding and splice site sequences of RYR1 and CACNA1S genes followed by GS Junior pyrosequencing. The developed workflow permitted the identification of MH candidate mutations in 10 of 12 patients examined so far.

It is caused by mutations in ZMPSTE24 gene encoding a zinc me talloproteinase important in the post translational modification of lamin. Eleven different mutations in this gene have been identified in 11 patients with MADB from 9 independant families until now. We report a description of a 12 year old boy with MADB resulting from a novel missense homozygous mutation in ZMPSTE24 (c.1196A>G ; p. Y399C). The patient had typical skin, sparse hair and skeletal features of MADB, short stature, mild microcephaly, facial dysmorphism and a striking failure of ossification of the interparietal region of the occipital, up to the position where transverse occipital suture can be observed. Skeletal anomalies such as acrosteolysis, long bone osteolysis, clavicular hypoplasia, spontaneous fractures, delayed closure of cranial sutures, man dibular hypoplasia and skull anomalies are commonly reported in MADB. Wormian bones have described in five cases, but failure of ossification of the occipital bone, reported previously in a single case, appears to be almost pathognomonic for this entity. Occipital bone counts several parts (squama, basio , exo , and supraoccipal) and its ossification is multicentric. This ob servation illustrates that ZMPSTE24 mutations could play a specific role in intramembranouseous ossification of the interparietal part of the squama (Inca bone) but not in the intracartilaginous ossification the supraoccipital. The failure of ossification in the squama appears to be a good handle for radiological diagnosis of mandibuloacral dysplasia type B.",2015

Objectives:Marfan syndrome (MFS) is an autosomal dominant connective tissue disor der caused by mutations in the FBN1 gene, resulting in defective glycopro tein fibrillin 1. The major features of MFS involve the cardiovascular, ocular and skeletal systems. Each child of an affected parent has a priori 50% chan ce of inheriting the mutation. We describe three families with FBN1 mutati ons which caused classic type of MFS and one family with neonatal form of MFS as a result of maternal germline mosaicism. Methods: In the first step a clinically affected future parent was tested. DNA was isola ted from peripheral blood and the molecular analysis of FBN1 gene was per formed by MLPA and NGS. If the causal mutation was found, fetal samples were taken in the first or second trimester of pregnancy. DNA was isolated from chorionic villus samples or uncultured amniotic fluid. The potential contamination of fetal samples with maternal cells was excluded by charac terization of alleles using STR. Results:We tested 15 fetal samples whose one parent is a carrier of the causal mu tation of the FBN1 gene for classical type of MFS, and 2 fetal samples whose mother is a carrier of the germline mosaicism mutation of the FBN1 gene for MFS neonatal form. Conclusion:We have confirmed 9 fetuses with a classic type of MFS and all results were confirmed after their birth. Knowledge of diagnosis is important for their immediate and future health care too.

Objective: The aim of this study was to elucidate the genetic etiology of a very early fetal phenotype of mesomelic dysplasia inherited from the father, and to compare with other phenotypes of mesomelic dysplasia. Methods: We performed molecular cytogenetic analysis using array CGH and the molecular results were confirmed using QMPSF and FISH. Results: At 11 weeks of gestation ultrasound showed a cystic hygroma of 4.5 mm, a punctate appearance of the forearmÃ¢ÂÂs bones, shortening of the lower limbs, clubfeet, and an unilateral pleural effusion. A TOP was per formed at 13 weeks of gestation. Mesomelic dysplasia was confirmed by fe tal autopsy, X rays, and a particular histological appearance(organization of chondrocytes in shortened columns, triangular densification at diaphyseal angulations). The father was followed since childhood for a growth retar dation ( 2.5 SD) with macrocephaly (+4 SD), ulnar deviation of hands and club feet, a significant shortening of ulna and fibula, bowed forearms and legs, difficulties with flexion / extension of the fingers. Fetal DNA analysis by array CGH revealed a microduplication of a 790 Kb involving genes HOXD13, HOXD12, HOXD11, HOXD10, HOXD8, HOXD4, HOXD3, MTX2. This microdupli cation was also identified in the father. Conclusions: The different phenotypes of mesomelic dysplasia with early prenatal expression are close, sometimes more severe than the phenotype of an affected parent; research of a genomic microrearrangement is indi cated since it can reveal notably a deletion of the SHOX region in Xp22.33, or 2q31.1 microduplication encompassing the HOXD cluster.",2015

The older sister showed more pronounced bowing of the femur and the tibia. Leg pain when walking lead to first surgical correction of both legs at the age of five years. Radiological examination showed genua and coxa vara and metaphyseal and epiphyseal dysplasia of the lower limbs. Additional metaphyseal dysplasia of the radius and the ulna and incomplete closure of the sacral vertebral arch were found concerning the younger si ster. Due to suspected recessive inheritance, exploratory genetic testing for shared homozygous alleles was employed. Material and Methods: Homozygosity mapping was conducted via whole genome SNP analysis using a CytoScanÃÂ® 750K Array. Subsequent Sanger sequencing of MMP13 gene was performed. Results: Only one homozygous region (11q22.1 q23.3; HG19:101,897,234 116,462,585) was identified, surprisingly containing the MMP13 gene which is associated with different subtypes of metaphyseal dysplasia. Sequencing of the MMP13 gene revealed a homozygous frameshift mutation (c.381delT) presumably leading to a premature stop codon in the catalytic region of the MMP13 protein. Conclusion: We describe a novel frameshift mutation in MMP13 gene (c.381delT). Inconsistent with previous reports of inherited metaphyseal dysplasia due to homozygous mutations in MMP13 gene, the associated phenotype of bone dysplasia is severe and requires surgical correction.",2015

Additionally, an analysis of modifying factors in cluding absence of craniosynostosis, history of surgery for craniosynostosis, seizures, and hearing loss was done. Methods: Participants in a cross sectional study included individuals with Muenke syndrome (P250R mutation in FGFR3) and their mutation negative siblings. Participants completed validated assessments of executive functio ning (Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function; BRIEF) and adaptive behavior skills (Adaptive Behavior Assessment System; ABAS II).Results: Forty four FGFR3 mutation positive individuals, median age 9, range 6 months to 52 years were evaluated with the BRIEF and ABAS II. Additio nally, 10 unaffected siblings were used as controls. For the General Executive Composite scale of the BRIEF, 32.1% of the cohort had scores greater than +1.5 SD, signifying Ã¢ÂÂPotential Clinical Significance.Ã¢ÂÂ For the General Adaptive Composite of the ABAS II, 28.2% of affected individuals scored in the Ã¢ÂÂEx tremely LowÃ¢ÂÂ categoryÃ¢ÂÂ (3rd 8th percentile of normative population) and 53.9% were below the Ã¢ÂÂ AverageÃ¢ÂÂ category (less than the 25th percentile). Multiple regression analysis showed that the presence of craniosynostosis was not a predictor (P , 0.7) of BRIEF and ABAS II scores. Conclusion: Individuals with Muenke syndrome are at an increased risk for exhibiting differences in adaptive and executive functioning when compa red to a normative population and unaffected siblings. These differences were observed regardless of whether craniosynostosis was present.",2015
23347,"BackgroundCafÃÂ© au lait macules (CAL) are the commonest presenting feature of neurofi bromatosis type I (NF1), and hence indicators of risk for future NF1 related pathology. Few genotype phenotype correlations in NF1 are known. Predic tors of mild, Ã¢ÂÂCAL onlyÃ¢ÂÂ phenotypes allow for better prognostication and pa tient care; p.(992del Met) is the only longstanding example. p.(Arg1809Cys) has recently been reported in association with a similar phenotype (Messia en, unpublished; Pinna et al, 2014).MethodWe examined genotypes of a cohort of patients with NF1 for evidence of variants predicting a mild phenotype. ResultsCutaneous neurofibromas (NFs) are less common in patients with missense variants than in those with truncating, frameshift or splice variants (p<0.05). p.(Arg1809Cys) is a recurrent substitution (7 individuals from 4 families) in patients without NFs. This mutation has recently been suggested by other groups to be associated with a CAL only phenotype, indicating that this is a robust association. Further substitutions seen in pedigrees without NFs include p.(Arg1276Gln), in 10 individuals from 2 unrelated families, and others clustered around the Ras binding domain. Discussion Missense substitutions in NF1 predict a lower cutaneous NF burden. It is likely that further specific genotype phenotype correlations will emerge with testing of more patients. Exclusion of rare complications will require collaborative approaches and long term follow up data. Conclusion Certain substitutions in NF1 segregate with very mild disease. Molecular diagnosis can inform prognosis and management of these patients.

According to the recently published recommendations for diagnosis and treatment in EB, the assessment of mutational landscape is instead a fun damental step to a comprehensive diagnosis path; Next Generation Sequen cing (NGS), throughout parallel ultra deep sequencing of many genes, would represent a proper method for reducing timing and costs in EB diagnostics. We developed an EB disease comprehensive amplicon panel (AmpliSeq pa nel), to accomplish NGS onto Ion Torrent PGM platform. The panel was dealt on ten patients with known genetic diagnosis, and then employed in eight family trios with unknown molecular footprinting. The AmpliSeq panel, obtaining a proof of concept of the sensitivity, speci ficity, and accuracy of this kind of procedure, showed successful in finding the causative mutations in all the ten patients with known mutations, fully confirming SS data. Besides, showing consistent with the clinical diagnosis, it was effective in trios, identifying all the variants, even the ones SS missed or in case of de novo mutations.

Here we report on a foetus affected by severe skeletal dysplasia that resulted in stillbirth at weeks 22 of gestation. The patient presented with generalized limb shortening and intrauterine fractures of the lower leg bones revealed by prenatal ultrasound and autopsy examination. Since no clinical diagnosis could be established, we performed NGS panel encom passing all 2741 genes known to be associated with Mendelian disorders (i.e. disease associated genome; DAG). With this approach, we were able to demonstrate the diagnosis at a molecular level, which turned out to be peri natal lethal hypophosphatasia (HPP). This severe form of HPP , characterized by an inborn defect of ossification, results either in stillbirth or early post natal death. NGS panel detected compound heterozygous ALPL missense mutations: c.1283G>C (p. R428P) and c.1363G>A (p. G455S), next confirmed by Sanger sequencing. Mutations demonstrated in our proband, although previously described in other HPP cases, have not been reported to coincide in a single individual.

23351,"We have previously identified a non coding RNA, PRINS, as a differentially expressed transcript in psoriatic uninvolved and healthy epidermis. Our in vitro experiment showed that PRINS expression is altered after exposure to various stressors i. e. UVB, translation inhibition and microbial agents. A potential stress signal in psoriatic involved skin may be the extracellular DNA, which activates the AIM2 inflammasome. The activated inflammasome cleaves the precursor proIL 1ÃÂ² form into mature, functioning IL 1ÃÂ² which plays a well known role in the pathogenesis of psoriasis. The aim of our study was to investigate whether PRINS affects the expressi on and activation of IL 1ÃÂ² in normal human epidermal keratinocytes (NHEK) and the elevated expression of PRINS in psoriatic uninvolved epidermis con tributes to the inflammatory aspect of the disease. The highest level of IL 1ÃÂ² secretion could be induced by priming the NHEKs with TNF ÃÂ± and IFN ÃÂ³ and a subsequent treatment with the synthetic DNA analogue poly(dA:dT). This treatment resulted in a 2 fold PRINS expression and a significantly elevated (p,0.02) IL 1ÃÂ² secretion. Next we silenced and overexpressed PRINS in NHEKs and performed the above IL 1ÃÂ² inducing treatments. Neither the silencing nor the overexpression of PRINS had any effect on the IL 1ÃÂ² secretion of NHEKs suggesting that this non coding RNA does not have any regulatory role in the AIM2 inflammasome signaling.",2015
23352,"Olmsted syndrome (OLMS) (MIM#614594) is a rare, severe keratinization disorder characterized by bilateral mutilating palmoplantar keratoderma and periorificial keratotic plaques. Other associated features include corne al lesions, diffuse alopecia or sparse hair, digital constriction, nail dystro phy, autoamputation of fingers and/or toes. Infections and squamous cell carcinomas can arise on the keratotic areas. OLMS should be differentiated from several genodermatoses, such as Vohwinkel syndrome and Acroder matitis enteropathica. Although most cases are sporadic, both autosomal dominant and X linked inheritance have also been reported. The heterozy gous mutations in TRPV3 were identified as a cause of autosomal dominant type, while the X linked recessive inheritance was associated with the mu tations in MBTPS2. Recently, the homozygous TRPV3 mutations have also been reported in a few recessive cases. We report a 16 year old male patient who has referred to our clinic with se vere palmoplantar keratoderma, autoamputation of fifth toes, mild periori ficial, perianal and genital keratotic plaques, and mild intellectual disability with prediagnosis of OLMS. His parents had consanguinity and his brother, who has died at the age of 8 due to complication of infections, had similar phenotype. We performed whole exome sequencing (WES) for the index case and a novel homozygous TRPV3 mutation (NM_145068;c.1247G>T;p. Arg416Leu) was identified in our patient. Additionally, we confirmed this mutation by using Sanger sequencing and the parents were found to be he terozygous carriers for this mutation. To our knowledge, this is the third reported autosomal recessive OLMS case in the literature. We conclude that the homozygous TRPV3 mutations result in a more severe OLMS pheno type.

Currently, 15 nsCL/P susceptibility loci have been established. Some of the yet unidenti fied genetic risk factors might be detected by increasing the marker density in genome wide datasets. We used data from a genome wide meta analysis of European individuals (Ludwig et al. 2012, Nature Genetics). Based on ~500.000 genotyped markers, imputation was performed using 2184 alle les (1kGP data). After quality control, a high density dataset of ~8.26 milli on variants was statistically analyzed. One previously unreported SNP was identified with genome wide signi ficance (rs6740960 at 2p21, P,1.6x10 08). Interestingly, this variant maps 5bp adjacent to a predicted Myc binding site upstream of the PKDCC gene. Pkdcc is downregulated in mice carrying a deletion of the region homolo gous to the 8q24 nsCL/P major risk locus (Uslu et al. 2014).

Recently, heterozygous mutations in the gene FAM111A have been shown to cause OCS. OCS is allelic to Kenny Caffey syndrome (KCS), which has a less severe phe notype of small, dense bones, short stature and primary hypoparathyroi dism with hypocalcaemia. FAM111A mutations have been identified in both disorders. Recent publications suggest that FAM111A plays an important role in a pathway controlling calcium homeostasis. We present a case of an infant who was found antenatally to have a clover leaf skull, reduced bone density and intracranial calcification (presenting as intracranial echogenicity on ultrasound scanning). The presence of intrac ranial calcification led to a relatively long list of differential diagnoses. The baby was born at term but died within a few hours of birth. On post mortem examination features of OCS were identified and there was confirmation of foci of calcification in the basal ganglia. A de novo heterozygous mutation in FAM111A was subsequently detected, confirming the diagnosis. Intracranial calcification is a recognised feature of OCS, but only on postna tal imaging.

Defects in sixteen other genes have been identified in association with dominantly and recessively inherited forms of OI. These genes play a role in the processing of collagen type I or in the control of osteoblast dif ferentiation or function. Despite these advances, a small proportion of indi viduals that present with a phenotype of severe OI do not have mutations in any of the genes that are known to be associated with OI. We performed whole exome sequencing to identify the molecular defect in two unrelated girls with severe bone fragility and a clinical diagnosis of osteogenesis im perfecta type IV, and identified two homozygous variants that affect very conserved and interacting residues in a novel protein that interacts with collagen type I and other matrix proteins. The residues substituted by these mutations are essential for the binding of this protein to collagen type I. Skin fibroblasts from our patients express the protein at apparently normal levels but secretion of collagen type I was delayed. Binding of the mutated protein to collagen type I was decreased. Analysis of an iliac bone sample from one affected individual showed that the trabecular bone was hypermineralized on the material level.

23356,"Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) is a genetically heterogeneous disorder cha racterized by bone fragility. OI is now understood to be a collagen related disorder, with mutations in type I collagen structure causing dominant OI, while deficiency of collagen related proteins cause rare recessive OI forms. Type V OI is the only rare OI type to also have dominant inheritance. It is caused by a heterozygous mutation (c. 14C>T) in IFITM5, which encodes BRIL, a transmembrane protein expressed in osteoblasts. The mutation ge nerates a start codon, adding five residues to the BRIL N terminus. Howe ver, the mechanism of type V OI and its relationship with type I collagen is unknown. We identified 8 patients with type V OI. Using cultured patient osteoblasts, we verified normal expression and stability of mutant IFITM5 transcripts and BRIL protein level. Both early (ALPL and IBSP) and late (osteopontin and osteocalcin) markers of osteoblast differentiation are in creased in type V OI osteoblasts. Mineralization, assayed by alizarin red stai ning, was increased in type V OI osteoblasts vs control. In contrast, type V OI osteoblasts have one third the level of COL1A1 transcripts in control in mid to late differentiation, with concomitantly decreased collagen protein secre tion, crosslinked collagen in matrix, and altered appearance of fibrils depo sited in culture. The increased mineralization and advanced differentiation of type V OI osteoblasts demonstrate a gain of function mutation leading to the overactive tissue calcification and hypertrophic callus formation seen in type V patients. Decreased type I collagen expression, secretion and matrix incorporation establish type V OI as a collagen related defect. This work was supported by NICHD intramural funding.",2015

23358,"Background: PagetÃ¢ÂÂs disease of Bone (PDB) is a common skeletal disorder with a strong genetic component. We identified a susceptibility locus for PDB on chromosome 14q32 by GWAS, tagged by rs1049863 within the RIN3 gene. Here we investigate the candidacy of RIN3 as a predisposing gene for PDB. Methods: We conducted re sequencing of the 14q32 locus in PDB cases and controls and studied expression of RIN3 in bone tissue and bone cells by quantitative PCR, western blotting and immunohistochemistry. Results: We detected 16 missense variants in RIN3, including 12 rare poten tially damaging variants, 7 of which were detected only in PDB. A common coding variant (p. R279C) in LD with the GWAS hit (r2,0.96) was strongly associated with PDB (OR,0.64, P,1.4x10 9). The rare variants were also strongly associated when combined (OR,3.72; P,8.9x10 10). mRNA for RIN3 was strongly expressed in lung, bone and liver with increased expres sion in osteoclasts as compared with bone marrow (p,0.02). Expression of RIN3 increased at the mRNA and protein level during osteoclast differentia tion in vitro. Conclusions: These findings indicate that RIN3 is the causal gene for PDB on 14q32 and suggest that its susceptibility is mediated by a combination of common and rare coding variants. While the function of RIN3 in bone biology is incompletely understood the data are consistent with a model whereby RIN3 acts to inhibit osteoclast formation and that the predisposing variants damage its ability to do so, resulting in the osteoclast activation characteristic of PDB.

PagetÃ¢ÂÂs disease of bone (PDB) is a focal disorder of bone that affects seg mentally the skeleton, presenting an increase in osteoclast number, size and activity that results in a variegated and anarchic bone structure that alters the mechanical properties. The existence of genetic factors is one of the etiopathogenic hypothesis that attempts to explain the origin of PDB. The most plausible candidate gene is sequestosoma1 gene (SQSTM1), encoding the p62 protein, which plays an important role in cellular signal crossroads related with osteoclastogenesisOnly 3% of patients in a historical cohort of 288 patients were carriers of a mutation in SQSTM1 gene. Five patients were carriers of the c.1000G>C (p. E273D) mutation, not described to date in the literature. The aim of our study was to try to evaluate the putative role c.1000G>C (p.

A popula tion study in 100 healthy individuals alleles by dHPLC failed to detect mu tation. Then, the cDNA of SQSTM1 gene was cloned in the expression vector pCEFL FLAG. After site directed mutagenesis the c.1000G>C mutation was incor porated into the construction. Finally COS1 cells were transfected with our construct to perform western blotting and immunofluorescence assays. By immunofluorescence and western blot assays we did not find differences between the transfected cells with the wt construct and transfected cells with the c.1000G>C construct (Fig1 2).In conclusion, our results suggest that c.1000G>C (p.

Chronic periodontitis is an inflammation disorder affecting 30 50% of the adult population, leading to teeth attachment loss and degradation of the alveolar bone. Aggressive periodontitis (AP) is a rare form of the disease with a prevalence of approximately 0,1%. It is characterized by an early age of onset, rapid rate of progression and high inflammation activity leading to loss of teeth before the age of 35, if untreated. Here we report on a Tyrolean four generation family indicating an autoso mal dominant inheritance pattern for AP . The result of our genome wide linkage analysis revealed one large co segregating chromosomal region in affected individuals. The interval is 12 Mb in length and contains approxi mately 300 genes. In addition, we performed whole exome sequencing in four affected family members to identify possible common variants in the linkage region. Assuming a monogenic cause for the disease we have been looking for an unknown, heterozygous mutation in the coding sequence and exon/intron boundaries. Identified variants were filtered with common pa rameters including alignment against various mutation databases and prio ritized based on their translational and predicted functional effects. In our functional studies we have already shown a significant reduction of chemotactic and phagocytic activity of neutrophils in affected individuals. In regard to these preliminary results we propose a mutation contributing to an immu nological dysfunction. Signs of Ehlers Danlos syndrome (EDS) present in some family members may also suggest a mutation resulting in disturbed connective tissue deposition.",2015
23360,"Bruck syndrome, a disorder caused by recessive mutations in either PLOD2 or FKBP10, is characterized by contractures and bone fractures and shows strong clinical overlap with Osteogenesis Imperfecta (OI). Animal models for OI are indispensable for unraveling molecular mechanisms in OI pathogene sis. The zebrafish was recently shown to be a useful vertebrate organism to model OI both at the phenotypic and molecular level. Zebrafish mutants that model OI display generalized reduced bone density and misshapen bo nes with evidence of fractures. Although the molecular role of PLOD2 has been documented, no animal models for Bruck syndrome, caused by PLOD2 mutations, have been reported. To elucidate the function of PLOD2 in verte brate skeletal development, zebrafish harbouring a homozygous plod2 non sense mutation were phenotyped using ÃÂµCT scanning, alizarin red staining for bone, toluidine blue staining and ultra thin sectioning. Mutants presen ted with a shortened body axis and malformed craniofacial structures. The skeleton was severely affected with evidence of bone fragility and fractures, bowing and kinking of the ribs and fin bones. The vertebral column was sco liotic with compressed vertebrae and excessive periosteal bone formation at the vertebral end plates. The observed phenotype is concordant with the clinical findings detected in Bruck Syndrome patients.

Pseudoxanthoma elasticum (PXE), an autosomal recessive ectopic minerali zation disorder caused by ABCC6 and ENPP1 mutations, is characterized by skin, ocular and cardiovascular (CV) symptoms. PXE shows distinct clinical variability, with growing importance of modifier genes. Modifiers have pre viously been studied using a candidate gene approach, which only yielded VEGFA as a modifier of the PXE retinopathy. We introduced Whole Exome Sequencing (WES), capable of analyzing mul tiple genes in a single reaction, to identify potential modifiers by comparing patients with extreme phenotypes. WES was performed in 13 molecularly and histologically confirmed PXE patients with an extreme (absent or se vere) CV phenotype (based on clinical presentation and vascular calcium scoring). Comprehensive functional analysis of variants unique to the severe cohort led to 9 modifier candidates, which were subsequently validated using San ger sequencing and screened in an independent cohort of 50 PXE patients. Genotype/allele frequency analysis and multiple logistic regression confir med significant association of 3 SNPs with severe CV disease: rs2228570 (VDR gene), rs13006529 (CASP10 gene) and rs1042714 (ADRB2 gene). All were previously linked to CV disease and functional data mining yielded links to the PXE pathophysiology. Particularly for rs2228570, reported to increase VDR transcriptional activity, upregulation of several VDR transcrip tional targets was demonstrated in PXE. In conclusion, WES enables to characterize candidate modifier genes through a targeted analysis approach in patients with extreme phenotypes.

The molecular etiology of PXE has become increasingly challenging as mutations in both ABCC6 and ENPP1 were shown to cause overlapping phenotypes and mo difier genes are beginning to be identified. We evaluated the causal role of ENPP1 mutations in PXE patients with an incomplete ABCC6 genotype in both an autosomal recessive or digenic inheritance model. Further, we as sessed whether ENPP1 variants, which also cause a severe cardiovascular disease called Generalized Arterial Calcification of Infancy (GACI), could have a disease modifying effect in PXE patients with an exceptionally seve re and rapidly progressive (cardio)vascular phenotype. ABCC6 and ENPP1 genotyping of 40 clinically and histologically confirmed PXE patients was performed by Sanger sequencing and MLPA. A vascular calcium score was obtained through whole body CT scanning. In a cohort of 40 PXE patients (13 with an unidentified and 17 with an incomplete ABCC6 genotype; 10 with severe cardiovascular disease), no additional ENPP1 mutations could be found. In one patient of the cardiovascular cohort, an additional ENPP1 mutation co inherited with biallelic ABCC6 mutations was identified. The vascular calcification score of this patient was exceptionally high (Agatston score of 3600 compared to an average of 422 in PXE patients), resembling the findings in GACI patients.

This gene encodes an endopeptidase, which by function, degrades extracellular matrix components. Three MMP 3 variants namely; rs679620, rs591058 and rs650108 have previously been associated with Achilles tendinopathy. Moreover, variants; rs679620 and rs3025058, have been studied for their association with anterior cruciate ligament ruptures (ACL) in two studies. Therefore, the aim of this research was to explore all four variants within MMP 3 with the risk of ACL injuries. Material and Methods: A case control genetic association study was employ ed. In total, 232 control participants (CON) and 234 participants with ACL ruptures (ACL) were genotyped for all four MMP 3 variants. Within the ACL group, 120 participants reported a non contact mechanism of injury (NON subgroup). Investigated polymorphisms included; rs3025058 (5A/6A), rs679620 (G/A), rs591058 (C/T) and rs650108 (G/A) respectively. Statisti cal analysis involved investigating the allele and genotype frequency distri butions in addition to conducting inferred haplotype analysis between the cases and control participants. Significance was accepted when P<0.05.Results: After adjusting for age, sex and weight, no independent associati ons were noted for all genotype frequencies (>P,0.350). Furthermore, no differences in the inferred haplotypes amongst the cases and controls were observed.

23367,"AbstractSarcopenia is one of the most deleterious effects of aging. The involuntary loss of muscle mass, strength, and muscular function have a major impact on quality of life in the elderly population. The etiology of the sarcopenia is not clearly established, although, a multifactorial process that develops from the fourth decade of life is proposed. In a previous clinical report we found that evaluation of the muscular contractility is a per se and indepen dent factor in the sarcopenia development not related with the muscle vo lume. In order to understand this phenomenon, we analyzed the molecular pathways involved in the muscle performance and the sarcopenic process. Genetic expression patterns in functional and non functional elderly groups were studied in 15 muscle biopsies from both groups, using a QRTPCR ar ray (RT2Profiler, Qiagen). We studied critical signaling pathways involved in the sarcopenic process (apoptosis, autophagy, WNT , TGF Beta, TNF Alpha and interleukins). Immunohistochemestry and confocal analysis were also performed in order to explore differences in the distribution of the muscu lar proteins involved in the contractile process (actin, myosin, myopalladin and SERCA). Preliminary results showed an overexpression of genes invol ved in apoptosis, autophagy and interleukins in the non functional group.

We filtered, consistently with the expected autosomal dominant inheritance, a heterozygous nonsense mutation (c.4000C>T/p. R1334X) in the KDM5B gene that co segregates with SHFLD and targets transcripts to nonsense mediated mRNA decay, contributing to protein haploinsufficiency. KDM5B encodes a JmjC demethylase, which regulates genes with a role in bone metabolism. The expression of two of its targets, SMAD7 and TCF3, is modified in KDM5B haploinsufficient cells. We similarly showed through luciferase assays that wild type KDM5B, conversely to the truncated form, controls the promoter of RUNX2, a key transcription factor involved in osteoblastic differentiation. Moreover the expression levels of RUNX2 and OPG are altered in a model of osteoblast like cells, established from patientÃ¢ÂÂs skin fibroblasts. Overall these results suggest that haploinsuf ficiency of KDM5B could cause transcriptional alteration of genes linked to bone development. Therefore, considering the variable expressivity and reduced penetrance of SHFLD, we propose KDM5B as a likely second genetic event participating in the index family.",2015
23368,"Introduction: Beckwith Wiedemann syndrome (BWS), an overgrowth dis order, and Silver Russell syndrome (SRS), a growth retardation disorder, are imprinting disorders associated with abnormalities of the 11p15 region. The majority of BWS cases result from loss of methylation at the KvDMR imprinting control centre whilst ~40% of SRS cases arise from loss of me thylation at the H19 DMR imprinting control centre. Materials and methods: 11p15 MS MLPA was performed to detect dosa ge and methylation abnormalities of the 11p15 region in a patient with a suspected diagnosis of SRS. Results: The patient was found to have loss of methylation at KvDMR at all probes tested and no 11p15 dosage abnormalities. Loss of methylation at KvDMR is a known cause of BWS but not SRS. Conclusion: This is the first report, to our knowledge, of a patient with loss of methylation at KvDMR only presenting with a SRS phenotype. There have been previous reports of rare patients with loss of methylation at both KvDMR and H19 DMR that present with SRS. It has been hypothesised that the region with greater demethylation gives the dominant phenotype and that, in cases where multiple regions have a similar degree of methylation, one region might have a dominant effect. Also ~45% of SRS cases have an unknown etiology. Therefore, a possible reason that this patient is presen ting with a SRS phenotype despite having loss of methylation at KvDMR only, could be that another, as yet unknown, locus with a dominant effect is also affected.",2015

In 2010, 456 skeletal dysplasias (SD) were classified by molecular, biochemi cal and/or radiological criteria, into 40 groups. The precise, final diagnosis is often difficult due to the high phenotypic and genotypic variability. Aim: To improve SD molecular diagnosis using a custom designed Next genera tion sequencing (NGS) panel, including a total of 315 genes or regulatory regions (967Mb). A total of 60 SD probands without known mutations were clinically and radiologically evaluated. All probands and in some cases family members, were analyzed using the SKELETALSEQ. V3 panel and sequenced (16 pati ents/run) on a MiSeq (mean coverage 100X). All variants were confirmed by Sanger sequencing or aCGH. The molecular defect was identified in 24 probands (40%): 23 mutations (missense, stop or small deletions) and one GLI3 deletion. Interesting cases include the identification of the first FGF9 mutation in a family with cranio synostosis, a second case of spondylometaphyseal dysplasia due to POP1 mutations and the detection of POCA1 mutations in two families with pri mordial dwarfism/SOFT syndrome. In conclusion: 1) The SD NGS panel has permitted a high mutation detection rate, 40%, higher than in other pathologies (average 26%). 2) We have de monstrated that FGF9 mutations can cause not only multiple synostosis but also sagital/coronal craniosynostosis in humans, as observed in the sponta neous mouse model. 3) The advancement in genetic diagnosis of these dis orders will improve the management, monitoring and treatment of the pa tients and allow prenatal and preimplantational studies. 4) Exome sequen cing may be helpful in those cases in which no mutation was identified.",2015

Facial characteristics may contain macroce phaly, broad forehead, round face, large, fleshy ears, hypertelorism, almond shaped eyes and retrognathia. Most cases of Weaver syndrome are sporadic and caused by a heterozygous mutation in the EZH2 gene on chromosome 7q36.The aim is to present a case report of a 3 year old boy first investigated be cause of speech delay. His birth weight was 5080 g (> + 2 SD), length 53 cm (0 SD) and head circumference 39 cm (> + 2 SD). In early neonatal period he had an episode of hypoglycemia. At the age of 3 years his head circum ference was rather large (+2 SD) but his height was normal (102 cm, +0.5 SD). He had mild dysmorphic features round face, large, fleshy ears with speech delay, which could be the statement of intellectual disability.

Consi derable shortening of the lower limbs and spine kyphosis were found and chorionic villi sampling with a subsequent SNP array (300K, Illumina) and FGFR (OMIM*146000) gene mutation screening (negative) were done. SNP array revealed 4.8 Mb long heterozygous microdeletion at 4q28.3q31.21 that spanned 14 OMIM genes. SNP array examination of the parents showed 0, 87 Mb long microdeletion at 4q28.3 in the phenotypically normal father. FatherÃ¢ÂÂs microdeletion was shorter and compared to the foetus microdeleti on did not span 13 OMIM genes. One of the genes deleted only in the foetus was the RAB33B gene (OMIM*605950), in which the recessive mutations were recently identified in individuals with skeletal Smith McCort Dysplasia 2 (SMC2, OMIM#615222). Although the phenotypic signs in the foetus were not typical for SMC2, microdeletion was considered to be likely pathogenic for the foetus. Results were discussed with the couple and the parents de cided to continue pregnancy. Repeated ultrasound examination at 16th WG confirmed significant femurs shortening, thoracic kyphosis and mild shor tening of the upper limbs. Ultrasound at 27th WG showed apart from the skeletal dysplasia ventricular septal defect, clinodactyly and IUGR. Postnatal examinations of the boy were in a concordance with prenatal findings.

To date, 14 genes encoding primary cilia proteins have been involved in the SRP group. Here, we report the molecular screening of 94 SRP individuals by targeted NGS. Methods: We performed targeted NGS of a customized ciliopathy gene pa nel, called ciliome, on a cohort of 94 individuals including 50 ATD, 23 EVC, 13 SPRIII, 2 SRPII, 1 SRPIV, and 5 Sensenbrenner. Results: We identified 93 variations in 56/94 individuals. Among the 50 ATD cases, 30 were found to harbor variations in DYNC2H1 (21), IFT140 (2), IFT144 (2), WDR34 (1), WDR35 (1), WDR60 (1) or IFT43 (1), whereas and one heterozygote variation in DYNC2H1 and in IFT140 was identified in another case. DYNC2H1 variations were also identified in 9/13 SRPIII cases. WDR34 or IFT122 variations were identified in 2/5 Sensenbrenner cases. Finally, among the 23 EVC cases, EVC (9) or EVC2 (6) variations were iden tified in 15. Interestingly, a maternal deletion of EVC (4) or EVC2 (3) was present in 7 cases.

The mole cular basis of vEDS has been well studied, showing a wide range of mutati ons in COL3A1 , encoding type III procollagen. Most mutations lead to glycine substitutions in the helical domain of procollagen. Despite the identification of numerous COL3A1 mutations, the mechanisms by which mutant type III collagen cause dermal and vascular fragility are not well understood, but factors, other than mechanical failure, are believed to contribute to the phe notype. To study the role of type III collagen in development and disease, we genera ted a transgenic mouse model, which expresses Col3a1 harbouring a typical glycine substitution (p.(Gly183Ser)) within the ÃÂ±1(III) procollagen helical domain. Col3a1 MUT animals display clinical features reminiscent of human vEDS patients including thin translucent skin and wound healing problems leading to the development of severe transdermal skin wounds. Biomecha nical testing revealed substantial fragility of the skin and aorta of Col3a1MUT animals. Collagen fibrils in the skin and aorta were loosely packed, displayed a highly variable diameter, and secretion to the ECM was severely disturbed. The adventitia was significantly thinner and, smooth muscle cells made less connection with elastic fibers, and showed more intracellular space.

The cause of this rare sporadic condition is unknown. Very rarely severe recurrent panniculitis has been reported in families with the PiZZ genotype of alpha 1 antitrypsin deficiency. Clinical Summary: We describe a multiply consanguineous family in whom two siblings and a cousin have relapsing nodular panniculitis. This presen ted in the newborn period and continued as frequent flare ups involving widespread painful lumps in the skin associated with fever, a raised CRP and white cell count. Additional features in this family include cataract, mi cronodular cirhosis, developmental delay and growth delay. Initial treatment with systemic steroids and Anakinra partly ameliorated the condition. The cousin responded well to treatment with a monoclonal antibody against tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF ÃÂ±).This family were recruited into the Molecular Pathology of Human Gene tic disease study.

23378,"Progressive pseudorheumatoid dysplasia (PPD) is a rare autosomal reces sive disease, causing progressive joint stiffness, pain and typical radiogra phic abnormalities in young children. Classically, the disease presents with decreased joint mobility, in particular reduced hip movements, and a pro gressive involvement of metacarpophalangeal joints (MCPs), interphalange al joints, wrists, elbows, knees, shoulders and ankles. The first symptoms mostly manifest in childhood, between three and eight years of age. There are no extra skeletal manifestations. Stature of patients with PPD is normal in infancy but deviates generally to lower than the third percentile in adult hood. It is a progressive disease although the rate of progression is variable between patients. Most patients are initially misdiagnosed because of the rarity of the disea se and the unawareness of most clinicians. Presentation of PPD can mimic juvenile idiopathic arthritis as osseous joint swelling can be mistaken for synovitis. Although, there are no arguments for inflammation in PPD as in flammatory markers are always within the normal range. Radiographs can also help to distinguish, as destructive or erosive bone changes are never seen on radiographs from PPD patients. PDD arthropathy is associated with loss of function mutations in the WISP3 gene, firstly described in 1999.

AAA risk increases after the age of 65 years. Genetic suscep tibility, smoking, hypertension, and atherosclerosis are established risk fac tors. Targeted ultrasound screening of high risk cases allows reduction of AAA related mortality, thus a better risk prediction model based on clinical characteristics and biomarkers is needed to earlier identify persons at risk. We aim to identify molecular markers for AAA disease by identifying genes involved in aortic vascular wall remodeling in AAA patients. Methods: Microarray based genome wide expression analysis in affected aortic tissue of AAA patients was performed. Results: In our gene expression studies in affected aortic tissues, we found genes which have been associated with AAA before: COL11A1, AdipoQ and LPL. Using Ingenuity IPA we identified immunity related pathways. Intere stingly, expression levels of genes involved in the TGFÃÂ² signaling were si gnificantly changed. We designed a flow chart to select genes as possible markers based on their level of expression, potential as blood marker and possible relevance for aneurysmal disease. We will validate these markers in experimental models for aneurysmal disease and study them further in blood of AAA patients.

Importantly, 50% of Smad3 / mice died suddenly between 6 and 24 weeks of age. Successive macroscopic analysis showed up to a 5 fold increase in ascending aortic diameter. We next perfor med longitudinal studies, showing a steep increase of aneurysmal growth within only 6 weeks. Since the aneurysmatic aortic wall remained translu cent, this was indicative for the absence of large scale extracellular matrix remodeling or collagen deposition. Indeed, immunohistochemical analysis of Smad3 / aortic walls showed no increase in extracellular matrix accumulation, no excessive collagen or CTGF staining, nor loss of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs).Smad3 / animals recapitulate the aortic phenotype observed in patients with SMAD3 mutations. Smad3 deficiency leads to imbalanced activation of downstream genes such as Smad6/7 and no activation of CTGF and MMPs in VSMCs.

He had frequent syncopal episodes since young age, left bundle branch block and inverted T waves in V1 V3. He was implanted with pacemaker and then with cardioverter with frequent ventricular fibrillation shocks. Echocardio graphy exhibited a severe dilatation and hypokinesia in the right ventricle while the left ventricle was apparently normal.

Clinical evaluation of the 6 double heterozygotes has revealed a phenotypic heterogeneity with 1 asympto matic case, 3 patients affected with ACM, 1 with HCM and 1 showing both phenotypes. Conclusions: This is the first time that patients showing co inheritance of ACM and HCM mutations are reported. The genotype phenotype correlation in these rare patients indicates that such digenic inheritance is associated with heterogeneous phenotypes, probably due to the incomplete penetran ce and variable expressivity of both mutations.",2015

ESHG. ORG 113Back to inde x of the myocardium. Conventional genetic testing of genes encoding desmo somal components results in a diagnostic yield of about 50% of ACM pro bands. Aim To search for large deletions/duplications in desmosomal genes in a large cohort of ACM index cases. Methods and Results Genetic screening for large deletions/duplications in 5 desmosomal genes was carried out in 68 unrelated index patients dia gnosed affected with ACM according to revised 2010 Task Force criteria, and resulting negative for pathogenic point mutations in the same genes. Quantitative real time PCR (qPCR) experiments were performed on an ABI PRISM 7900HT Sequence Detector by using at least three different sets of primer pairs located within exons from the proximal to the distal part of each gene. In 3 patients (4.4%) we identified a plakophilin 2 (PKP2) copy number reduction when compared to control samples thus suggesting a lar ge heterozygous gene deletion. The PKP2 gene deletion was confirmed by Multiplex ligation dependent probe amplification with the SALSA MLPA kit P168 (MRC Holland). Haplotype analysis revealed a conserved haplotype among the PKP2 mutation carriers, strongly indicating a common founder. Conclusions Among desmosomal genes, only PKP2 shows large deletions of the entire coding region. These findings support the importance of expan ding genetic testing in ACM patients with inclusion of PKP2 large deletion analysis when the results of conventional sequencing are negative.",2015
23388,"BACKGROUND: Arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy (ACM) is an autosomal dominant myocar dial disorder at risk of sudden death in the young and athletes. Thirteen cau sative genes have been found, with a central role of the desmosomal genes. Since causative mutations in ACM genes have been detected in about 50% of probands, additional disease genes remain to be identified. METHODS and RESULTS:In a large ACM family, where the proband resulted negative for mutation screening of desmosomal genes, genome wide linkage analysis highligh ted a shared region of 2 Mb on chromosome 19p13.3 (multipoint LOD score,3.85). CNV analysis was carried out in order to exclude the presence of structural variations. Whole exome sequencing was performed in 4 affec ted patients, through two different platforms (HiSeq2000 Illumina, Ion Tor rent) at a mean coverage of 80X. Sequencing data didnÃ¢ÂÂt reveal the presence of any novel variant shared by the 4 subjects, neither into the linkage region nor in the rest of the exome. Exons with insufficient reads (Ã¢ÂÂ¤15 depth) of the 13 ACM genes and of the genes inside the critical region were further evalu ated by Sanger sequencing but no additional coding mutations were found. Only a novel intronic variant (c.766+8C>A) in TMEM43 gene was identified. The segregation of this variant among all the available family members ex cludes an association with the disease phenotype. CONCLUSION:In this ACM family showing no mutations in known ACM genes segregating with the disease phenotype, a novel locus was mapped on chromosome 19p13.3 and a critical region of 2 Mb was defined.",2015
23389,"Despite the significant achievements in the field of medicine and biology, morbidity and mortality from atherosclerotic lesions remain at a high level, and the range of adequate antiatherosclerotic therapy goals is still limited due to the lack of validated biomarkers. Therefore, the main goal of our re search is the development of a new reliable genomic indicators panel for early, pre clinical diagnostics of possible future disease. We performed a bioinformatics analysis of potential candidate genes direct ly or indirectly involved in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. The analyzed genes list included lipid metabolism, matrix metalloproteinases, folate cycle, oxidative stress genes and some others. The motifs search was implemented using bioinformatics package MEME Suite. In the investigated genes vicinity we detected 670 motifs, homologous pre mi RNA, and 4300 motifs, homologous mature mi RNA. The average mi RNA distribution density in genomic sites ranged from 0 to 2.2 pre mi RNA per 1000 p.n. and mature mi RNA from 0 to 6.9 per 1000 p.n. Inside the inve stigated genes we identified 433 motifs, homologous pre mi RNA, and 2780 motifs, homologous mature mi RNA. The average motifs distribution densi ty amounted to 0.4 per 1000 p.n. for pre mi RNA and 3.3 per 1000 p.n. for mature mi RNA. The most frequently encountered were motifs, homologous mmu mir 466i, hsa mir 5096, hsa mir 1273g, ppy mir 1268 and hsa mir 619. According to the MirTarBase data we established that hsa miR 138 5p is the multigene regulator for the studied genes groups. The obtained results could be used to develop atherosclerosis diagnostic panel. This research was supported by the Ministry of Education and Science of Russia project",2015
23390,"Introduction AF is the most prevalent sustained cardiac arrhythmia, re sponsible for considerable morbidity and mortality. Due to the complex pathophysiology of AF the underlying mechanisms are incompletely under stood. In the few cases of familiar form of AF, where the causative mutation has been found, it has been identified in genes encoding ion channels invol ved in sodium or potassium handling. Nevertheless in the majority of cases with familiar forms of AF the cause is still unknown. Methods and Results Whole exome sequencing was performed on seven individuals from a Danish family, presumably with a highly penetrable mo nogenetic form of AF. Quality control showed that the whole exome could be investigated sufficiently. Analysis, following Broad institute current best practices, revealed 2 novel variants (not found in over 60,000 controls, of which 2000 Danish).

23391,"Atrioventricular nodal re entry tachycardia (AVNRT) is the most common paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia, affecting women twice as fre quently as men, often before turning 40 years. Familial clustering, early onset of symptoms, and lack of structural anomaly indicate involvement of genetic factors in the development of AVNRT . However, the field is poorly investigated, and a great amount of work is to be done, in order to reveal the plausible genetic causes. We hypothesized that AVNRT patients have a high prevalence of mutations in 38 genes potentially involved in arrhythmic diseases and highly expressed in the heart. Next generation sequencing of 38 genes previously associated with car diac arrhythmia and highly expressed in the atrioventricular conduction axis was applied to the DNA profile of 99 AVNRT patients using Haloplex target enrichment system and the results were verified using an Illumina next generation sequencing amplicon based platform, the TruSeq Custom Amplicon Kit. In total, we found 28 mutations in 11 genes; 25 missense mutations, two synonymous, and one in frame mutation. Twelve of these were novel. The main part of these mutations are in genes responsible for sodium and calci um handling, such as SCN5A, SCN10A, the CACNA genes, ATP2A2 encoding the SERCA pump, and RYR2, indicating that AVNRT might be a sodium and calcium channel disease like Brugada Syndrome as opposed to atrial fibril lation which in addition has a potassium channel affection. This is, to our knowledge, the first study to report a genetic component in AVNRT .",2015
23392,"Brugada syndrome (BrS) is a heritable primary electrical disorder with ty pical ECG alterations accounting for up to 20% of sudden cardiac death in young patients (<45 years) without apparent structural cardiac abnorma lities. BrS is genetically heterogeneous and so far a dozen causative genes have been identified, of which SCN5A is the predominant gene. At present a causal mutation is identified in about 20 30% of BrS patients. SCN5A enco des a sodium channel and loss of function mutations will lead to a decreased sodium inward current. In the Netherlands, an SCN5A founder mutation (p.1795insAsp) was previously described, which gives rise to an overlap syndrome between BrS, Long QT syndrome and cardiac conduction defects (Postema et al., 2009).Here, we present 23 BrS patients of 17 different Belgian families carrying the identical c.4813+6_4813+7insGGGT mutation in SCN5A. This mutation, previously described in two families of Western European descent, creates a cryptic splice site in exon 27 leading to complete loss of function of the sodium channel (Hong et al., 2005; Rossenbacker et al., 2005). We identified a shared haplotype consisting of seven genetic markers spanning a region of 5.2 Mb. Based on the haplotype size, we estimate that the common ancestor of these families lived approximately 300 years ago. The clinical spectrum of mutation carrying individuals ranges from asymptomatic to full blown BrS. In this cohort, a relatively low number of sudden cardiac death has been observed. As such, we have identified the first Belgian BrS founder mutation. These families will be instrumental for the future identification of BrS phenotype modifying genes.",2015
23393,"Background. Sudden cardiac death with normal heart can occur in the set ting of inherited ion channel diseases. Among these, Brugada syndrome (BrS) is characterized by non ischemic ST segment elevation associated with PR prolongation and right bundle branch block, whereas LenÃÂ©gre di sease is characterized by atrio ventricular block with progressive structural changes of the conduction system. In these arrhythmic syndromes, more than 1300 nucleotide variations has been identified in SCN5A gene. Methods & Results. A 35 years old asymptomatic male died suddenly du ring sleep. Post mortem examination excluded extracardiac causes of sud den death as well as the absence of structural abnormalities in the working myocardium. Personal clinical history re assessment revealed a Ã¢ÂÂcoved typeÃ¢ÂÂ ST segment elevation on right precordial leads with PQ prolongation (220 msec) in a patientÃ¢ÂÂs ECG performed during blood donation, compatible with BrS. Detailed conduction system investigation by serial section tech nique showed severe fibrosis of the bifurcating His and proximal bundles with sclerotic interruption of the left bundle branch. Genetic screening of SCN5A (NM. 198056.2) gene identified a mutation in exon 22 (c.3673 G>A , E1225K), defined as Ã¢ÂÂlikely to be pathogenicÃ¢ÂÂ by in silico tools, and pre viously linked to BrS phenotype with atrio ventricular block. Cascade gene tic screening detected 5 additional family mutation carriers, and provoked electrical stimulation unmasked ECG abnormalities in 2 of them. Conclusion. LenÃÂ©gre disease and BrS are overlapping clinical entities, ÃÂ«bookendsÃÂ» in a continuum of sodium current deficiency, accounting for a structural cardiomyopathy of the specialized conducting tissue occurring in the setting of an otherwise normal heart.",2015

The deletion was inherited from her unaffected mother. LPP has been linked to cell cell adhesion, cell motility and transcriptional regulation however a mechanistic link between LPP function and cardiac embryogenesis has not yet been established.

23395,"Cardiac arrhythmias contribute significantly to cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Developing approaches towards disease prediction and treat ment of heart rhythm disorders is therefore an important topic in healthy aging. Although environmental factors play an important role in the patho genesis of cardiac arrhythmias, multiple studies have demonstrated that there is also a strong genetic component. Molecular pathways involving the homeodomain transcription factor Shox2 control the development and function of the primary cardiac pacemaker. Genotyping untranslated regi ons of the SHOX2 gene in 378 arrhythmia patients and 1870 control indivi duals demonstrated a significant association between a 3Ã¢ÂÂUTR variant and the disease (p,0.00515, OR,2.373). Patients with the 3ÃÂ´UTR variant clini cally presented significantly longer PR intervals. Mechanistically, this vari ant creates a novel functional microRNA binding site. Circulating microRNA levels in plasma were found to be significantly altered in all testable patients carrying the 3Ã¢ÂÂUTR variant, compared to patients with the wild type allele (p,0.0095).These results provide direct evidence that a genetic variant in the SHOX2 gene is associated with cardiac arrhythmias and point to a microRNA as po tential biomarker and therapeutic target in this disease.

Mutation detection leads to proper clinical diagnosis, therapy, behavioral management, and family screening. This may decrease the incidence of sudden cardiac death. Our center took a pioneering initiative to set up a comprehensive cardiac ar rhythmia genetic research and diagnostic laboratory to provide specialized cardiogenetic clinical services in Saudi Arabia and neighboring countries and to create a database of local mutations to develop a Ã¢ÂÂgenomic chipÃ¢ÂÂ to be used in routine screening for cardiac arrhythmia patients in these countries. Our ultimate goal is to discover new genes in arrhythmia pathology, which will lead to development of novel gene targeted pharmacotherapy for car diac arrhythmia. Presently, we receive referrals from all over the Kingdom and neighboring countries. Over 3 years, 46 families were assessed, and genetic analysis was perfor med in our lab. Arrhythmogenic mutations were found in 29 index patients (63%). Cascade screening of family members identified 176 relatives with mutations, 80% which were founder mutations. Some were more common in specific geographic regions. All mutation carriers had variability in clini cal presentation of the arrhythmias (no symptoms to sudden death). In 6 families, index patients presented with arrhythmias and deafness, (Jervell Lange and Nielsen syndrome JLNs), with mutations in both alleles of the KCNQ1 gene.

23397,"Introduction: Sudden cardiac death (SCD) is responsible for a large proportion of sudden, unexpected deaths in young individuals (<50 years). In forensics, one third of the cases remain unexplained after autopsy. In the remaining two thirds, structural cardiac abnormalities are found, although often unspecific and without a clear cause of death. Sudden deaths are frequently suspected to be caused by inherited car diac diseases. Implementation of genetic investigations in forensic me dicine may increase the diagnostic rate in cases of sudden death in the young. The purpose of the study was to explore the utility of genetic testing using next generation sequencing (NGS) by investigating the frequency of pathogenic variants in 100 genes associated with cardiac diseases in a cohort of suspected SCD victims. Methods: Genetic inve stigation of 133 unrelated, young SCD victims with (1) sudden unex plained death (SUD), or (2) non diagnostic structural cardiac abnor malities without cause of death, or (3) structural cardiac abnormali ties diagnosed as cardiomyopathy, was performed. Using NGS, all exons and UTR regions of 100 genes associated with inherited cardiomyo pathies and cardiac channelopathies were investigated. Results: The results show that 45% of SUD cases, 35% of cases with non diagnostic structural cardiac abnormalities and 48% of cases with cardiomyo pathy had likely pathogenic variants in one or more disease related genes. Conclusion: Screening by NGS of these 100 genes revealed that between one third and half of the suspected SCD victims had likely pa thogenic genetic variants. Large scale genetic testing seems a powerful supplementary tool in forensic investigations in sudden death cases and increases the diagnostic efficiency.",2015
23398,"Introduction: Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is a rare pathology defined by left ventricular dilatation and reduced ejection fraction, leading to heart fai lure and often heart transplantation. We identified DCM causing dominant heterozygous mutations in BAG3 ( BCL2 associated athanogene 3). BAG3 is a cytoprotective co chaperone involved in protein homeostasis, and plays a role in clearance of proteotoxic misfolded, aggregated, or altered proteins. Deleterious BAG3 mutations are located in the BAG domain, which interacts with the chaperone Hsp70 family (heat shock protein 70). We hypothesized that BAG3 mutations induce cardiomyocyte dysfunction due to impaired cel lular proteostasis. Methods/Results: We studied biochemical and cellular effects of BAG do main mutations in heterologous cell models with transient overexpression of GFP BAG3 chimeric proteins, or in the zebrafish model organism. Rat neonatal cardiomyocytes overexpressing BAG3 mut displayed disorganized sarcomeres, BAG3 positive cytoplasmic aggregates, and atrophy, resulting in cell death.

Accordingly, using heat shock induced transient denaturation of luciferase reporter mimicking proteotoxic stress, we showed decreased protein refolding in HEK cells transfected with BAG3mut compared to BAG3wt. Finally, zebrafish microinjected with mutant cDNA developed pericardial edema mimicking cardiac dysfunction. Conclusion: Our results strongly suggest that BAG3 mutants fail to bind to HSP70, blunting HSP70 dependent response to proteotoxic stress. Such functional alteration leads to protein aggregation, cardiomyocyte loss and probably cardiac insufficiency. It reveals a new putative DCM pathological mechanism.

23399,"Cardiomyopathies are characterized by extreme genetic and clinical hetero geneity, with >50 causative genes known to date. With Sanger sequencing, in about 45% of the hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) patients a patho genic mutation was identified, whereas only 15 20% of the dilated cardio myopathy (DCM) and noncompaction cardiomyopathy (NCCM) cases were solved. Nowadays we make use of a targeted NGS panel (48 genes) including the Titin gene (TTN ), the largest known human protein that plays a central role in sarcomere organization. TTN truncating mutations have been found to be a major cause of DCM, but these type of mutations have not frequently been reported in NCCM or HCM. Sixty seven NCCM patients, 84 DCM patients and 150 HCM patients were te sted with a NGS targeted sequencing approach, including the largest isoform of TTN (NM_001267550.1).Twelve DCM patients (~14%) and 9 NCCM pa tients (~13%) showed a truncating mutation in exons encoding the A band of TTN (exons 259 359), whereas no mutations were detected in HCM pati ents in this region. This A band of Titin was recently reported to contain the majority of truncating mutations in DCM patients (Roberts et al.

23401,"Introduction: Genome wide association studies (GWAS) have identified multiple loci associated with coronary artery disease, the most significant of which is located on chromosome 9p21. Harismendy et al (Nature, 2011) suggest that the causal variants at this locus are two SNPs that disrupt STAT1 transcription factor binding to an enhancer element. This may therefore result in altered gene expression of nearby protein and RNA genes. Here, we investigated this hypothesis by uti lising genome editing to produce isogenic cell lines that differ at only the two SNPs of interest. This allows any functional effects of these variants, in response to inflammatory signalling, to be determined. Methods: Genome editing by recombinant adeno associated virus (rAAV) was used to specifically alter the genotype of the two SNPs in HeLa S3 cells, with all other variants remaining constant. Heterozygous lines were derived from the homozygous protective parental line. Genotype specific variation in STAT1 binding was assessed following interferon ÃÂ³ treatment using chromatin immunoprecipitation and quanti tative PCR (ChIP qPCR). Local gene expression of treated cells was also in vestigated using qPCR. Results: ChIP qPCR revealed a reduction in STAT1 binding by approximately 50% in cells heterozygous for the risk alleles compared to the homozygous non risk control. However, no difference in gene expression of CDKN2A, CD KN2B and several ANRIL transcripts was observed. Analysis of additional local genes is on going. Discussion: The observed reduction in STAT1 binding suggests that these SNPs are functional, but the absence of a gene expression difference indi cates that other functional variants in the region may be required to contri bute to disease.",2015

Results Among the 50 individuals, 22 exhibited CNVs on four chromosomal regi ons. Out of these were 16 TOFs exhibiting duplications, three of which were linked to chromosome 17q21.31, two to 16p11.2, and one each to 2q13,, 19p13.3 and 20p12.3. Furthermore, one TOF together with three complex cases involving BAV, and SAM, KartagenerÃ¢ÂÂs syndrome, exhibited deletions at 16p11.2 and 15q11.2. Interestingly, an individual case with TCA showed copy number gain at 2q13, while another with Kartagener syndrome sho wed a copy number loss at the same locus. These duplications/deletions involved sequences of 420 1200 kbp. The qPCR verification assays on five of the studied individuals confirmed the duplications and deletions found by cytoscanning.

We tested whether polygenic risk for CAD was associated with cognitive ability in community dwelling cohorts of middle aged and older adults. Materials and Methods: Individuals from Generation Scotland: Scottish Fa mily Health Study (GS:SFHS, N,9865) and from the Lothian Birth Cohorts of 1921 (LBC1921, N,517) and 1936 (LBC1936, N,1005) provided cognitive data and genome wide genotype data. Polygenic risk profile scores for CAD were calculated for all of the cohorts using the largest available GWAS data set, the CARDIoGRAM consortium (22,233 cases and 64,762 controls). Poly genic risk profile scores for CAD were then tested for their association with cognitive abilities in the presence and absence of manifest cardiovascular disease. Results: A meta analysis of all three cohorts supported a negative associati on between CAD polygenic risk and fluid cognitive ability, verbal intelligence and memory. Whereas these findings were not statistically significant in the Lothian Birth Cohorts, in GS:SFHS polygenic risk for CAD was negatively and significantly associated with fluid cognitive ability (ÃÂ² , 0.02, p , 0.03), Mill Hill Vocabulary test (ÃÂ² , 0.03, p , 0.006) and Logical Memory (ÃÂ² , 0.02, p , 0.042).Conclusions: Increased polygenic risk for CAD is associated with lower co gnitive ability in older adults.

This signal was independent of a common copy number variation in the HP gene and a previously reported common SNP (rs2000999) at that locus, previously shown to associate with haptoglobin levels. In addition to haptoglobin, these common variants were also associated with non HDL cholesterol, demonstrating an inverse relationship between their effects on the two traits.

23407,"The identification of genes causing coronary artery disease (CAD) is one of the most important tasks to understand the disease and to develop potential new treatments. Genome wide association studies (GWAS) have identified more than 50 loci associated with CAD. If common variants increases the risk of CAD, it is likely that rare variants within the same locus also increase the risk. Indeed, the presence of such variants may even point the GWAS locus to the causal gene. Further, as rare variants are expected to have stron ger effects, unraveling the disease mechanism might be easier. Hence, this study aims to identify rare variants in known CAD risk genes and to find potential causal genes in CAD GWAS loci. We screened for variants in a total of 82 genes close to or harboring CAD associated SNPs (p<5x10 8). For these candidate genes, we screened for rare (<1%) truncating variants in a pool of 255 exome sequenced early onset MI patients with a positive family history. Each variant was validated by San ger sequencing and tested for co segregation with CAD in respective family members. We only identified a small number of rare variants in a subset of the can didate CAD genes. Exemplary, LDLR and ABCG8 are known to harbor rare variants increasing CAD risk and we confirm these findings. In addition, we also report rare variants in genes where only common risk variants are re ported so far. For instance, to our knowledge, we are the first to report rare loss of function variants in NBEAL1 .",2015

Materials and Methods: MSCs were isolated from umbilical cords using an explant method. Flow cytometry and StemProÃÂ® Differentiation Kits were used to characterise MSCs. MSCs were differentiated to VSMCs using TGF ÃÂ²1, and characterised by qPCR, immunofluorescence and calcium imaging. Results: A bank of 114 umbilical cord derived MSCs was created, and cha racterised by cell surface markers (99.7% positive for CD105, CD90 and CD73, and 0.2% positive for the negative markers CD45, CD34, CD11b, CD19 and HLA DR) and differentiation into adipocytes, chondrocytes and osteo blasts. MSCs were differentiated towards a VSMC lineage, demonstrated by an upregulation of VSMC markers; ACTA2, TAGLN2 and CNN1 (p<0.001). As a proof of concept, we investigated the functional CAD associated coding va riant, rs3825807, located in the protease ADAMTS7 in MSCs carrying either the risk or non risk allele. A trend showed MSCs with the risk allele had increased migratory ability, consistent with findings reported by Pu et al., (2013). We are currently undergoing studies with differentiated VSMCs. Conclusion: Our findings show that our MSC bank can be used to study ge netic variants associated with complex disease including CAD related phe notypes.",2015
23409,"Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) causes severe heart failure, but even with over 30 causative genes identified, DCM pathophysiology is poorly under stood. In addition, current treatments only ameliorate symptoms without treating underlying causes, therefore developing genetic therapies is es sential. We identified human DCM mutations in MYPN (myopalladin), and created a knock in mouse model carrying one such mutation. We also in troduced two synonymous variations into the murine recombination vec tor, creating an experimentally validated shRNA target sequence permitting specific extinction of mutant allele expression. Introduced variations did not interfere with normal allelic splicing, nor allelic expression ratios in either skeletal or cardiac muscles when assessed via allele specific qPCR. Mice were fertile, with normal growth rates and long term survival. Mutant heart gross morphology appeared normal, but electron micrographs demonstra ted thickened sarcomeric Z lines. Echocardiography until 18 months de monstrated that both heterozygote and homozygote mutant mice displayed cardiac insufficiency from the age of three months. In mutant mice, systolic ventricular diameter and volume were increased, and ejection fractions and fractional shortening reduced, confirming systolic dysfunction. In contrast to most published murine models of dominant human DCM which display recessive phenotypes, we generated a knock in mouse model of persistent mild dominant DCM, highlighting its particular utility for potential allele specific genetic therapy.

Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is a disease of the myocardium caracterized by left ventricular dilatation, systolic dysfunction and myocardial fibrosis. It is a major cause of morbility and mortality and the first indication for car diac transplantation. Clinical manifestations are variable and include heart failure, thromboembolism and sudden cardiac death. The etiology may be genetic for up to 50% of cases either sporadic or familial (F DCM). Most F DCM cases have an autosomal dominant form of inheritance (90%). More than 40 genes have been associated with the disease, and the frequency of mutations varies from one population to another. The purpose of our stu dy is to describe the mutations producing DCM in Mexican patients. Coding exons and intron flanks of 31 well characterized genes responsible for DCM, were sequenced by NGS with the Ion Torrent technology looking for patho genic genetic variants in Mexican patients diagnosed as having idiopathic or F DCM. Preliminary results in 22 index cases show mutations in the TNNT2, RBM20 and CSRP3 genes, and two different mutations already detected in patients with Brugada Syndrome, in the SCN5A gene.

ResultsWe studied 240 subjects: TTN probands (n,47) and their relatives (n,73), LMNA probands (n,31) and their relatives (n,29), and probands negative for both (TTN/LMNAneg DCM; n,60). Median follow up was at least 2.5 years in each group.

So far, only disease management and treatment of symptoms are available. Haploinsufficient mice of a recently described no vel mouse model of Col3a1 show reduced mechanical stability of the aorta and spontaneous death (~28% of cases) due to aortic rupture similar to the human EDS IV phenotype. Our goal was to characterize the mechanical sta bility of the aorta in this mouse model compared to wild type mice. Methods: 1.5 mm long sections of aortic arch as well as ascending and de scending aorta from Col3a1 mice were mounted on two 200 ÃÂ¼m diameter stainless steel wires on a TissuePuller (Danish Myo Technology) and stret ched radially until tissue damage, thereby continuously recording the stret ching force (in mN).Results: Maximum force at tissue damage was significantly lower in hete rozygous Col3a1 mice compared to age and gender matched wild type animals in both the ascending and descending parts of the aorta. For both genotypes, the mechanical stability of the aorta was decreasing, with incre asing distance from the heart. Conclusions: We developed a protocol for the assessment of the mechanical stability of mice aorta, which is suitable to detect significant differences bet ween heterozygous and wild type Col3a1 mice.

Clinical characteristics and course of disease of 215 molecularly proven patients (146 index cases and 69 relatives), were analysed. We found 126 distincts variants that were divided into five groups : 1) Glycine substitutions (71 variants in 127 patients), 2) splice site and in frame insertions deletions (36 variants in 55 patients), 3) variants leading to haploinsufficiency (7 variants in 14 patients), 4) non glycine missense variants within the triple helix (4 variants in 7 patients), 5) non glycine mis sense variants or in frame insertions deletions, in the N or C terminal part of the protein (8 variants in 12 patients). Overall, our cohort confirmed the severity of the disease with a median age at first complication of 29 years [IQR 22 to 39], the most frequent being arterial (48%) and digestive (24%) ruptures. Groups 2 and 1 were significantly more severe than groups 3 5 with extreme median ages at first major complication of 23 to 47 years. Pa tients of groups 3 5 had a less typical phenotype and remarkably absence of digestive events. The glycine replacing amino acids were frequently desta bilizing residues of the collagen assembly. Thus, the natural course of vEDS and the clinical phenotype of patients are influenced by the type of COL3A1 variant.

The main aim of this project was to identify and characterize novel alterati ons in APOB in order to identify the genetic cause of the hypercholesterole mia in these patients. Methods: we performed whole exome sequencing of 5 Portuguese clinical FH patients apparently mutation negative. All results found in APOB were analysed. For functional studies LDL from index patients and relatives was separated and marked with FITC LDL for studies by flow cytometry in HepG2 and U937 growth assays. Results: We identified 2 alterations in exons 19 and 26 in 2 patients. In vitro analysis of exon 26 alteration (p.

As reported before, also in this family the pene trance is also reduced. Alteration in exon 19 had a neutral effect. Conclusions: The spectrum of functional alterations in APOB outside the fragments routinely screened is growing. Screening of all 29 exons of APOB should be performed in routine diagnosis, now possible by NGS. It is expec ted that a further 10% of clinical FH patients can have FH due to a novel APOB mutation.

FH has a prevalence of 1:500, being estimated that >90% of these patients have mutations in the LDLR . Although more than 1600 alterations have been identified, the majority of them remain wi thout functional studies. The aim of this work is to construct vectors for the in vitro study of common alterations in Portuguese FH patients, contributing for phenotype/genotype clarification. Methods: The 14 most common LDLR alterations to date without functio nal assessment were selected. In silico assessment was performed using de scribed tools. Site directed mutagenesis was performed in a pcDNA3_LDLR plasmid and functional assessment is being performed in CHO ldlA7 cells by flow cytometry.

De spite the knowledge of the FH candidate genes, it is largely under diagnosed in European countries. Since FH increases the risk for coronary artery disea se (CAD) and myocardial infarction (MI), it might be specifically overlooked in the large number of such patients. Here, we systematically examined the frequency of potential FH causing variants in LDLR, APOB, PCSK9 and STAP1 by exome sequencing in 255 German patients with premature MI and a positive family history for CAD. We further performed co segregation analyses in an average of 5.5 family members per MI patient. In total, we identified eleven potential disease causing variants that co segregate within the families. Eight variants were previously reported as disease causing and three are novel (LDLR.p.

However, exome sequencing also revealed that some vari ants, which have been reported to cause FH, do not co segregate with the disease in respective families. The data reveals that 1 out of 20 patients with premature MI carries poten tial FH causing mutations. Hence a large proportion of FH patients escapes the diagnosis.

The proband was a 29 year old woman who died 11 days post partum due to two separate areas of dissection in the thoracic and abdominal aorta. On family screening, her 12 year old son was found to have a PDA, and her 56 year old father was found to have dilatation of the proximal ascending aorta (4.1cm), and a subsequent CT angiogram identified tortuosity of the innominate artery. No clinical features suggestive of a wider disorder of connective tissue were found in the probandÃ¢ÂÂs father or son, but both shared the MYH11 splice mutation. On ophthalmological examination, the probandÃ¢ÂÂs father also had anomalous vascular loops iden tified in both eyes. Conclusions: The family reported here exhibits the range of phenotypes as sociated with FTAAD caused by MYH11. In general, there is little genotype phenotype correlation in FTAAD, but the presence of PDA directs suspicion towards MYH11. In addition, one family member had retinal vascular tor tuosity, possibly resulting from his generalised abnormality of the vascula ture.

HS is at times accompanied by complex congenital cardiovascular anomalies whereas SIT is frequently associated with Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia (PCD). The genetic etiology of defects not associated with PCD is largely unknown. In this study we investigated the cause of situs anomalies, including HS and SIT (PCD excluded), in a consanguineous family.

23425,"Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is an inherited disorder of the heart muscle. HCM has been linked to dominant genetic variants in sarcomere ge nes, most commonly in MYH7 and MYBPC3. The MYH7 and MYBPC3 gene products interact but have distinctly different functions: MYH7 encodes the myosin head, the molecular motor that binds and pulls actin, while MYB PC3 is a regulatory protein that binds to both the myosin and actin. Despite these functional differences, variants in both genes lead to a similar presen tation of HCM. To investigate the differences between the variant profiles of MYH7 and MYBPC3, we combine published and unpublished data from three centers (Stanford University, the Mayo Clinic, Harvard University). The combined dataset included results from 4349 patients. In MYH7, 215 out of 234 (91.9%) unique damaging variants are missense, while only 164 out of 343 (47.8%) are missense in MYBPC3 (Fisher p,1.25x10 6). We compared variant locations in MYH7 and MYBPC3 from HCM patients with those from 60,706 individuals in the Exome Aggregation Consortium (ExAC). We find a significant difference in the distribution of HCM and ExAC variant locations in MYH7 (KS p,3.95x10 13), but not in MYBPC3 (KS p,0.462). The peak of differential variant density in MYH7 covers the head, the lever arm, and the beginning of the tail of the myosin heavy chain molecule.

23426,"CARP/Ankrd1 belongs to the muscle ankyrin repeat protein (MARP) family involved in a mechano signaling pathway that links myofibrillar stress re sponse to muscle gene expression. Also, CARP/Ankrd1 has an important role in transcriptional regulation, myofibrillar assembly, cardiogenesis and myogenesis. Few studies supported a role of CARP gene variants in the etiology of hypertrophic (HCM) and dilated cardiomyopathy. We have performed screening for mutations/variants in Ankrd1 coding sequences in 50 familiar or idiopathic HCM patients. Two missense heterozygous CARP variants in exon 2 (P52A and R66Q) were identified, each in one patient. Preliminary functional analysis of these variants on protein level were performed in rat neonatal cardiomyocytes by Fluorescent Recovery After Photobleaching (FRAP) assay. The results of the FRAP experiments showed difference in mobility between wt and P52A variant, while R66Q exerted si milar behavior as wt protein. Our findings point to possible disruption of the protein protein interaction and disturbance of the normal cardiac signaling in cardiomyocytes caused by P52A allele variant of CARP/Ankrd1.This work was supported by grant 173008 from the Ministry of Education, Science and Technological Development of Republic of Serbia.",2015
23427,"Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a cardiovascular disease with high heterogeneity. The limited knowledge about ~40% patients suggests that it needs to be investigated to understand the pathogenesis of the disease. A large number of variants were identified by whole exome sequencing in seventy four HCM patients passing Sanger method sequencing eight HCM causative genes. After filtering against multiple databases and functional fil ter, 3228 SNPs and 475 InDels in 3046 genes were identified. TADA model was then applied using exome sequencing data of 2000 controls and 74 ca ses and 99 genes gained priority, with DNAH11, OBSCN ranking the first and second place, respectively. Associated analytical tools as DAVID and IntPath were also adopted to explore the novel mechanism underlying the HCM phe notype. The results showed that various genes and gene sets related to cyto skeleton, ATPase activity, dynein and calcium transport played critical roles in the pathogenesis of HCM, with a lot of other processes as well, implicating many processes involved in the HCM phenotype. We also found two novel OBSCN variants that co segregated with the HCM patients in two HCM fami lies. Additionally, we described the OBSCN role in HCM. Our study provides a way for exploring the pathogenesis of a less understood HCM cohort.",2015

We also demonstrated that patients with FLNC mutations showed marked sarcomeric abnormalities in cardiac muscle, and functional studies revealed that these FLNC variants resulted in the formation of large filamin C aggregates. Our aim was to characterize the mutational spectrum of FLNC in a large cohort of HCM patients. We perfor med a Next generation sequencing of FLNC in 335 HCM patients, including 117 sarcomeric mutation carriers. We identified a total of 25 HCM index cases who were heterozygous carriers of putative mutations, 21 in the 218 patients without sarcomere mutation (10%) and 4 in the 117 sarcomere positive cases (3%; p<0.05). Only five of the 25 FLNC variants were reported in healthy subjects in the Exome Sequencing Project (ESP) database, but all of them at a frequency <0.001%. Three variants, p. A1247V, p. A1539T , and p. A2340V, were found in two index cases. In nine of the 14 families we had several affected members, and all were mutation carriers. Interestingly, some of the FLNC mutations were linked to sudden cardiac death episodes. In conclusion, our work suggested that FLNC mutations were a significant cause of HCM. 1ValdÃÂ©s Mas R et al .

23429,"Introduction: Whole exome sequencing (WES) and whole genome sequen cing (WGS) are increasingly being used in clinical practice. However, these approaches continue to be expensive, time consuming and difficult to inter pret. So far, clinical WES studies have yielded diagnostic results in ~ 25% of cases. Hence, a complementary easier, equally sensitive method needs to be developed. Method: A 406 cardiac related (cardiomyopathy, congenital heart disea se, arrhythmias, vascular aneurysms) gene panel (with 10490 amplicons) based on Ion Torrent AmpliSeq technology was developed. So far, 243 gDNA samples were sequenced using the Proton Ion sequencing instrument. Results: In total, 4.13 Gb were mapped with 94% on target and base reads with 370 reads per amplicon and overall average base coverage depth of 325. In the 243 samples, a total of 51 variants (including 2 homozygous CACNA1C and SCN5A homozygous mutations) with an overall clinical sensi tivity of 51/242 (21%) was found. Sub panel diagnosis based clinical sensi tivity was 32% for cardiomyopathy, 10% for congenital heart disease, 31% for arrhythmias and 29% for aortic aneurysms/Marfan syndrome. Conclusion: This custom made, comprehensive cardiac gene panel appears to have a clinical sensitivity comparable to that of the current WES with the advantage of faster turnaround time and far fewer variants to analyse. Only in 6% of the genes on this panel were relevant DNA sequence variants iden tified. Hence, a tiered approach starting with a custom gene panel followed by WES is probably a more efficient clinical approach.",2015

Long QT syndrome is one of the most common congenital cardiac ion chan nel disorder that the morbidity and mortality rate can be decreased by an early diagnosis and proper treatment. Cardiac repolarization abnormality that is characterized by prolonged OT interval and propensity for ventri cular tachycardia of the torsades de pointes type are characteristics of the disease. This syndrome represents high risk for presyncope, syncope, car diac arrest and sudden death. Jervell and Lange Nielsen syndrome (JLNS) is recessive form of long QT syndromes with additional finding of profound sensorineural hearing loss. JLNS has been shown to occur due to homozy gous and compound heterozygous mutations in KCNQ1 or KCNE1. Pathoge nic mutations in the KCNQ1 gene were detected in all our JLNS cases. Index cases of 3 families were 2 month yr, 3.5 yr old female and 3 yr old male who visited the hospital due to intrauterine bradicardia, recurrent seizures/ syncope, cardiac murmur, respectively and had all congenital sensorineu ral deafness. Their electrocardiograms revealed a markedly prolonged QT interval. The sequence analysis of the probands revealed the presence of compound heterozygous mutation ([(c.477+1G>A) + (c.520C>T , p. R174C)] and homozygous missence mutations (c.728 G>A, p. R243H), (1097G>A, p. R366Q), respectively. Heterozygous mutation in KCNQ1 was identified on the maternal, paternal and sibling sides.

23431,"BackgroundTo date, genome wide association studies have identified 2 susceptibility loci for large artery ischemic stroke and 45 loci for coronary artery disease (CAD). We investigated whether these SNPs affected atherosclerotic plaque characteristics in the Athero Express Biobank Study (AE, www.atheroex press.nl) of patients with clinically significant carotid stenosis, from whom plaque specimens have been histologically analyzed. MethodsWe genotyped 1,439 patients from the AE and imputed missing genotypes using HapMap. We tested the 47 SNPs for association to macrophages num bers, smooth muscle cells (SMCs) numbers, neovascularization, intraplaque hemorrhage (IPH), atheroma size, calcification, and collagen content, using linear or logistic regression, correcting for age, sex, year of surgery, array type, and 10 principal components. We considered a significant association at p < 1.5 x 10 4 after Bonferroni correction for the number of variants and phenotypes tested. ResultsThe most significant association was found for rs12539895 (coded allele fre quency , 0.75, odds ratio , 1.59 per C allele, p , 9.0 x 10 6) with percentage of atheroma. This direction of effect was such that the same allele increases atheroma size and CAD risk.

23432,"Ceramide, the backbone of sphingolipids, is the key component which af fects atherosclerotic changes through its important second messenger role. In previous studies, the protective role of AMPK gene with its regulated genes in atherosclerosis and hypertension is shown. LASS5 (CerS5 ) gene takes place in ceramid synthesis and has an indirect effect on AMPK gene. In this study, our aim was to identify LASS5 gene function in athrerosclerosis. Briefly, LASS5 gene specific siRNA mediated gene silencing was performed in HUVEC and subsequently the differencial expession AMPK regulated ge nes were analyzed. Then, HUVEC cells were treated with AMPK inhibitor or activator in order to examine the relation of change in gene expression levels with AMPK activity changes. As a result, we have identified a noval physiological function of LASS5. The treatment of AMPK inhibitor (Com pound C) ligand significantly increased LASS5 mRNA expression in HUVEC. Downregulation of LASS5 was found to attenuate ceramide production, and increased the expression of eNOS and KLF2. In addition, we observed that presence of LASS5 siRNA induced the expression of KLF2 genes, and that this induction was partially prevented by Compound C. On the contrary, we observed that co presence of LASS5 siRNA and AMPK activator (AICAR) in creased the expressions of eNOS and KLF2. In summary, this is the first study demonstrated that LASS5 was involved in the negative regulation of atherosclerosis related genes, namely eNOS and KLF2. These findings provide an insight into the molecular mechanism of atherosclerosis and also have importance for the development of potential therapeutic agents in the treatment of atherosclerosis.",2015
23433,"Cardiac arrhythmia occurs when the electrical impulses of the heart become disrupted. This can lead to a variety of syndromes including Catecholamin ergic Polymorphic Ventricular Tachycardia (CPVT), Brugada Syndrome(BS), and Long QT Syndrome(LQTS).

In ca ses of sudden cardiac death where no record of the heartÃ¢ÂÂs electrical activity exists, it is extremely difficult to predict the correct molecular diagnosis. Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) technology allows the provision of clini cally relevant and cost effective solutions for molecular diagnosis.

LOY was not associated with plaque phenotypes. Event free survival for major cardiovascular disease events was lowest in the quartile with the most Y loss in blood (log rank test p value,0.03). Although LOY was corre lated between blood and plaque the variance was higher in blood suggestive for more Y instability in blood as compared to plaque.

23435,"Introduction: Patients with Marfan syndrome caused by FBN1 mutations have an increased risk of life threatening aortic complications. It has been shown that losartan reduces aortic dilation rate in these patients. The re sponse to losartan treatment, however, was highly variable between indi viduals. Here we investigate whether there is a difference in Losartan effec tiveness in genetically classified subgroups. Methods: In this predefined sub study of the COMPARE trial, we classified FBN1 mutations into: 1) Dominant negative mutations leading to a mutated fibrillin 1 protein incorporated in the extracellular matrix, 2) Haploinsuf ficient mutations leading to decreased amount of normal fibrillin 1 protein. The response to losartan therapy based on aortic root dilatation rate was compared between the two groups. Results: Baseline characteristics between treatment groups were similar. Overall, losartan significantly reduced aortic root dilatation rate. However, losartan only reduced aortic root dilatation rate in haploinsufficient pati ents and not in dominant negative patients. Conclusion: Marfan patients with haploinsufficient FBN1 mutations are more responsive to losartan therapy with respect to inhibition of aortic root dilatation rate compared to dominant negative patients. In order to predict response on losartan therapy, mutation classification should be performed for all Marfan patients.

New technology of targeted next generation sequencing has a great potential in diagnostic settings of cardio myopathies. It allows us to analyze several genes in parallel, which entails that several variants of potentially pathological or even unknown clinical significance are detected. Methods. We applied next generation sequencing of 46 genes which have previously been shown to be associated with different types of cardiomyo pathies (TruSight Cardiomyopathy Panel, Illumina) on group of unrelated patients with DCM, ARVC and ventricular fibrillation. Results. The summary of the results of our analysis of the entire group of patients will be presented.

Here we characterized the genetic architecture of ADAMTS13 through targeted next generation sequencing of 48 affected children and their unaffected siblings. In total, we identified 226 variants in ADAMTS13, 36 of which are rare and resist filtering for unambiguous allele calling. For genotyping in 270 trios, 21 common variants covering the complete ADAMTS13 gene were selected based on significance in the sib ship disequilibrium test (p<0.05) or protein altering properties. Trans mission disequilibrium testing was performed for affection status and ADAMTS13 activity levels using PLINK and FBAT , respectively. 10 SNPs were significantly associated with pediatric stroke (p<0.05 to <0.001), two of which (rs2285489, rs28793911) were also significantly associated with ADAMTS13 levels (p,0.0004 and p,0.0092). The C alpha collapsing test im plemented in AssotesteR was used to assess significance across the set of 36 rare variants yielding a significant association (p,5.73x10 6).

Parental ori gins of alleles were determined using long range phasing and genealogy as implemented in Alphaphase 1.1. POE was assessed using mixed linear models (adjusted for age, sex and relatedness) evaluating (1) phenotypic differences between reciprocal heterozygotes, and (2) effect of maternally and paternally inherited alleles separately. Analysis revealed potential POEs on cardio metabolic traits in seven loci (NTNG1, CELF4, CLDN14, CDKN1A, PMP22 TEKT3, GPR56, EIF4E) at P value <1.0x10 7. The strongest signal for parental origin specific association was obtained at rs531284 near NTNG1 for fasting glucose levels. The maternally inherited minor allele at rs531284 showed association with reduced fasting glucose level [mat, 0.67 s.d. units, Pmat,7.8x10 8] whereas paternal allele was not associated.

Methods: Our prospective study included 1000 patients with the final dia gnosis of premature CAD and classified into two groups with history of MI (n , 461) and without of MI (n , 539). The polymorphism variants were determined by PCR RFLP and High Resolution Melting techniques. Among study samples, 640 were followed with a median follow up time 59 months for determining association of major adverse cardiac events (MACE) and polymorphisms. Results: The prevalence of wild, heterozygous and mutant genotypes of R279Q polymorphism in MI group was 14.5%, 57.3%, and 28.2% and in non MI group was 36.9%, 38.4%, and 24.7%, respectively with a considerable difference (p < 0.001). There was a significant difference in the prevalence of wild, heterozygous and mutant genotypes of C1562T polymorphisms in MI group (12.4%, 41.2%, and 46.4%, respectively) and in non MI group (46.8%, 38.6%, and 14.7%, respectively) (p < 0.001). After adjustment for covariates, significant differences were revealed in genotypes of R279Q and C1562T polymorphisms between MI and non MI groups. No difference was found in total MACE free survival rate in MI patients and also in non MI pati ents with different genotypes of R279Q and C1562T polymorphisms. Conclusion: C1562T and R279Q polymorphisms of MMP 9 gene can be as sociated with the susceptibility to MI in premature CAD patients. However, these polymorphisms may not be able to predict long term cardiac events in these patients.",2015
23446,"Dominant mutations in the FOXC2 gene cause a form of lymphedema that usually develops around puberty. In a large percentage of patients, lym phedema is accompanied by distichiasis and varicose veins. Other clinical abnormalities, such as cardiac defects, epidural cysts, ptosis and cleft pa late have also been reported but are less common. FOXC2 is a member of the forkhead/winged helix family of transcription factors and plays essen tial role in different developmental pathways and physiological processes. Most of FOXC2 mutations described so far either truncate the protein or are missense mutations in the forkhead domain causing a loss of function.

ORG 127Back to inde x haplo insufficiency is associated with generalized hyperplasia of lymphatic system in mice as well as in humans. We previously described six unrelated families with primary lymphedema in which patients showed different FOXC2 mutations. Of those, 4 were mis sense mutations, one a frame shift mutation and the last one a stop muta tion; all of them were located outside of the forkhead domain. To evaluate their pathogenic potential, we now have examined their subcellular locali zation and performed a transactivation assay using a luciferase construct with FOXC1 response elements. All FOXC2 mutated proteins are able to localize correctly into the nucleus. Alf of them present reduced while the remaining increased transcriptional ability, ranging from a complete loss to a significant gain of function. Our data suggest that the unbalanced FOXC2 activity causes a dramatic perturbation of lymphatic vessel formation lea ding to lymphedema.",2015
23447,"Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension (PAH; OMIM 178600, ORPHA 422) is an autosomal dominant disease characterized by pulmonary vascular resi stance increase, vascular remodelling and right heart failure. Symptoms of PAH include fatigue, shortness of breath and syncope. Several genes have been related to HAP , the most implicated gene is BMPR2 with more than 300 mutations described, 80% in Familial HAP and 20 40% in Idiopatic HAP . However, some of the functional implications for these mutations are unknown. The aim was to characterize the pathological mechanism of se veral mutations in BMPR2 and correlate them with the clinical spectrum of the disease. Variants were selected from an in silico analysis. mRNA expression studies were performed using pSPL3 vector to confirm splicing alterations, studies of subcellular localization were performed using pEGFP N1 vector and lu ciferase assay were performed using pGL3 Bassic vector. Correlation geno type phenotype was performed using Spss v.19 software. Nine out of 24 analyzed changes affect mRNA processing (p. S52Sfs*2, p. C84F, p. P138A, p. R211R, p. Y218*, p. V278V, p.

23448,"Introduction: Catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) is a rare inherited cardiac disorder characterized by adrenergically mediated ventricular arrhythmias. The most common autosomal dominant form of CPVT is caused by mutations in the cardiac ryanodine receptor (RYR2) gene. Apart from the myocardium, this calcium release channel is highly expressed in the brain. Here we studied the prevalence and characte ristics of neuropsychiatric disorders in patients with CPVT . Methods: We included all CPVT patients with a pathogenic RYR2 mutation and intellectual disability (ID) from 4 tertiary referral centers in the Nether lands and Japan. ID was defined as significant impairment of cognitive and adaptive functions with onset before the age of 18. Results: Among 250 CPVT patients carrying a RYR2 mutation, we identi fied 18 patients with ID (7.2% compared to 1% of the general population). The RYR2 mutations (15 missense and 1 splice site) clustered in the known hot spot regions. Two mutations have been previously described in patients without reported ID. In 9 out of 14 patients studied (64%) the mutation ap peared de novo. The severity of ID ranged from mild to severe, and was often accompanied by behavioral disorders including autism and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. Of note, the majority of patients displayed marked supraventricular and ventricular arrhythmias, with a high incidence (39%) of serious arrhythmic events during follow up including 3 fatal events. Conclusions: ID is more prevalent among RYR2 positive CPVT patients than in the general population, and is associated with a malignant cardiac phe notype.

In order to assist the integration of patient data on rare diseases with tools for statistical analysis, we created advanced form of a patient/variation/symptom database for the use on desktop computers and particularly for installation on a web server. The secured web form of the database is con trolled via assignment of individual logins and passwords and security of the data is achieved by fine layering of data access/editing permissions and, at the same time, is adjusted to enable sharing of the data which is a crucial function of the database. Structure of the underlining MySQL database is designed in the way that each gene is represented by a separate table with patients/variations (rows) and their symptoms (columns), and the content of the tables is called by built in statistical functions to perform inference. Database administrator is able to add new genes (tables) while the users of the database create new records (rows) of patients/variations and fill in their symptoms. We will present current structure of the user interface of the software and details of the included statistical tools which enable to test hypotheses on subsets of patients and subsets of their variations and symptoms.

23450,"Introduction: Stroke is a leading cause of death and functional disability. A limitation in the current evaluation and treatment of patients with suspec ted stroke is the lack of a rapid diagnostic test. A blood based biomarker of acute stroke may expedite stroke diagnosis and prognosis. As such we sought to identify genes expressed in peripheral blood that are associated with (1) stroke, (2) primary stroke type, ischemic or hemorrhagic, and (3) stroke prognosis. Methods: Stroke cases and controls were recruited from a subset of centers involved in the international INTERSTROKE study. Patients were consecu tively assigned to the biomarker discovery cohort (N,302) or validation co hort (N,62). In the discovery cohort transcriptome wide peripheral blood gene expression was assessed using the Illumina HumanRef 8 v4 bead chip. Significant genes were validated using qPCR in the validation cohort. ABSTRACTS POSTERS ESHG 2015 | GLASGOW, SCOTLAND, UK | WWW. ESHG. ORG 128Back to inde x Results: Expression of a single gene, MCEMP1, was sufficient to distin guish between stroke cases and controls (FC,2.4, P value , 8.2 x 10 22, AUC,0.812). MCEMP1 expression also differentiated between ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke cases (AUC,0.783). Furthermore, MCEMP1 expression was significantly associated with one month outcome, measured as Modi fied Rankin Score (MRS), after adjustment for available risk factors, primary stroke type and baseline MRS (FC,1.29, P value , 1.09 x 10 5). Finally the associations between MCEMP1 and stroke and one month MRS were inde pendently confirmed in the validation cohort. Conclusion: Peripheral blood expression of MCEMP1 may have utility as a diagnostic test for acute stroke, in distinguishing ischemic stroke from intra cerebral hemorrhage and a prognostic biomarker of outcome.",2015
23451,"Introduction: CADASIL is a rare Mendelian stroke syndrome due to mutati ons in the NOTCH3 gene. CADASIL syndrome is characterized by ischemic stroke, migraine, and cognitive impairment in young patients with a family history of stroke. Whether mutations in NOTCH3 or other Mendelian stroke genes are risk factors in young patients unselected for syndromic features is unknown. Methods: Using exome sequencing, 10 Mendelian small vessel stroke genes were analyzed in young unrelated stroke cases (mean age: 47.6 years), com prising 100 intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) and 85 small vessel ischemic stroke (SVIS), and 185 matched controls from INTERSTROKE, a large inter national case control study of stroke. Results: Canonical CADASIL mutations were exclusive to cases and asso ciated with risk of all stroke (P,0.02), explaining 3.2%, 3%, and 3.5% of all stroke, ICH, and SVIS, respectively. We estimated that CADASIL mutati on carriers are at high risk of ICH (OR,9.36; P,0.02) and that the popula tion prevalence of CADASIL is 340 per 100,000 individuals. Non CADASIL NOTCH3 mutations were also associated with risk of ICH (OR,2.66; P,0.03) and were present in 19% of ICH cases and 8% of controls. Secondary fea tures of CADASIL (migraine, depression, psychiatric disturbances, subclini cal infarcts, parental history of stroke) were not more frequent in NOTCH3 mutation carriers as compared to non carriers. No significant associations were observed for the other 9 genes. Conclusion: NOTCH3 mutations are important risk factors for ICH in young people. CADASIL mutations pose high risk to ICH and their prevalence may be underestimated. Genetic screening of NOTCH3 should be considered in young stroke patients.",2015
23452,"Sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) ranks among the most common causes of death worldwide. SCA incidence in the community varies between 0.6 and >1.4 per 1,000 individuals. Because SCA mostly occurs in individuals without previously known cardiac disease, the identification of patients at risk for SCA could save many lives. In unselected SCA victims from the community, common genetic variants (which are not disease causing per se, but may increase susceptibility to VF) have recently also been associated with in creased SCA risk. However, whether rare genetic variants contribute to SCA risk in the community is largely unexplored. We here investigated the involvement of rare genetic variants in SCA risk at the population level, by studying the prevalence of six founder genetic variants present in the Dutch population (PLN p. Arg14del, MYBPC3 p. Trp792fsX17, MYBPC3 p. Arg943X and MYBPC3 p. Pro955fsX95, PKP2 p. Arg79X and the Chr7q36 IVF risk haplotype) in a cohort of 1440 unselected Dutch SCA victims included in the AmsteRdam REsuscitation Study (AR REST). The six studied founder mutations were found to be more prevalent, 1.1% carried one of the mutations, in our cohort of SCA patients than in a locally matched reference cohort (0.4%, n,1379, p<0.05) and in publicly available reference variant databases (e.g. the Genome of the Netherlands cohort, GoNL, 0%, n, 500 p<0.02). This finding provides proof of concept for the notion that rare genetic variants contribute to SCA risk in the com munity.

23453,"Aims:To assess the efficiency of the Familial Arrhythmic Network Scotland (FANS) in following up the families, and to assess the effectiveness of genetic testing, in those who died of sudden cardiac death with a structurally normal heart.

Results: In 27 cases of sudden cardiac deaths since the 01/01/11, there were 125 first degree relatives. Of these 73 (58%) received an ECG and 53 (42%) re ceived an echo. 21/27 tissues were genetically tested using the routine test panel of KCNQ1, KCNH2, KCNE1, KCNE2, SCN5A and RYR2. Pathogenic mu tations were found in 2/21 of cases (SCN5A and RYR2 genes). In the majori ty of families where no gene mutation was identified, no diagnostic findings were found on clinical investigations. In addition, when these findings were combined with an earlier audit, we also found that in 22/56 (39%) cases, there was evidence in the post mortem report of non toxic levels of alcohol consumption around the time of death. Conclusion:The yield of pathogenic mutation (10%) was lower than reported literature (15 33%). This may be due to restriction of genes tested. Family follow up of those with a sudden cardiac death was adequate, although could be impro ved. This audit also highlights the prevalence of recent exposure to alcohol/non toxic levels of alcohol at time of death in this group, and the role of alco hol in sudden death may merit further investigation.",2015
23454,"Objective: To assess the bi directional causal relationships between leuko cyte telomere length (TL) and coronary heart disease (CHD) using a Men delian randomization (MR) approach. Methods: Using a genetic risk score (GRS) of seven genetic variants associated with TL (Codd et al, 2013) as instrumental variable, we tested whether TL may be causally associated with CHD in two Swedish and one US cohort and, moreover, in summarized genome wide association study (GWAS) data. Likewise, we examined if CHD may be causally associated with TL using a CHD GRS comprising forty five variants (CARDIoGRAMplusC4D, 2013) as instrumental variable. Results: In observational analysis in our cohorts, we found shorter TL associated with higher risk of CHD incidence [hazard ratio (HR):1.20, 95% confidence interval (CI):1.04, 1.37] and a past CHD event associated with shorter TL (ÃÂ²: 0.07, 95% CI: 0.02, 0.12). TL GRS was associated with TL (ÃÂ²: 0.05, 95%CI: 0.02, 0.08), although its association with ever CHD was not significant [odds ratio (OR):1.01, 95% CI: 0.96, 1.06], nor was the MR analysis (OR: 1.29, 95%CI: 0.49, 3.42). However, the MR estimate from summarized GWAS data indicated causality (OR: 1.26, 95%CI: 1.12, 1.42). We further confirmed a causal effect of a past CHD on TL from summarized GWAS data (ÃÂ²: 0.04, 95%CI: 0.003, 0.08), but not in our own cohorts. Conclusions: Significant bi directional associations between TL and CHD were observed in three co horts of European ancestry. We further provided evidence for a causal effect of shorter TL on higher risk of CHD and for CHD event on shorter TL from summarized GWAS data.",2015
23455,"Introduction: Platelets play a key role in arterial and venous thrombosis. The glycoproteins (GP) on the platelet surface are involved in the adhesion process, by GP Ib V IX complex (CD42a and CD42b) and GP IV (CD36). They are also involved in the aggregation process, by GP IIb IIIa complex (CD41 and CD61). Therefore, their involvement in thrombosis is very important. Previous studies have identified the genetic loci that code for the GP , but the phenotypic variance among individuals due to genetic differences have not been defined. Materials and Methods: 935 individuals were studied from 35 large Spanish families recruited in the second phase of the GAIT (Genetic Analysis of Idio pathic Thrombophilia) Project. The GP were obtained using platelet specific immunolabelling and flow cytometry. The fluorescence mean (F) and counts of the positive GP events percentatge (CT) were determined for the CD36, CD41, CD61, CD42a and CD42b. A variance component analysis based on maximal likelihood was applied to quantify the covariates effect, shared en vironment and genetic factors. Genetic effects were defined as heritability (h 2) which estimates the proportion of the total variability due to genetic factors. Results: All of the GP parameters had high h 2 (range 0.37 0.71) with strong statistical significance (p value range 4.48ÃÂ·10 16 7.44ÃÂ·10 31). CD36CT and CD36F had the highest h2 (0.71 and 0.61 respectively). Conclusions: The high heritability of these traits means that genes play a pivotal role in determining the GP density on the platelet surface. Thus, it should be possible to identify specific genes that affect these platelet traits. Spanish Grants: FIS PI12/00612 and Red InvestigaciÃÂ³n Cardiovascular RD12/0042/0032.",2015
23456,"Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFA) is a proinflammatory cytokine produ ced from activated macrophages and has been shown to be associated with altered lipid metabolism. Dietary fat plays an important role in inflammatory response, with the level of TNFA reported to be increased following the inge stion of a high fat meal. However, not all studies have found an association between TNFA and postprandial triacylglycerol concentration (TAG), which could be due to the variations in the TNFA gene or meal fat composition. The present study investigated the effect of a common promoter polymor phism, 308GÃ¢ÂÂA (rs1800629), on circulating lipid metabolites, glucose and insulin concentrations over 8 h following sequential high fat meals in 207 participants (BMI: 25.9ÃÂ±0.2 kg/m 2; age: 52ÃÂ±1 years). Biochemical measu rements were determined at baseline and hourly interval following the test breakfast. At the baseline, the GG homozygotes were associated with higher fasting glucose concentration than A allele carriers (P<0.001). Following the mixed breakfast (49 g fat) and lunch (29 g fat), a significant association was observed between genotype and the incremental area under the time response curve (iAUC) for the postprandial TAG (P,0.03) with a 41% higher TAG iAUC in the GG homozygotes (n,139) (69% of this population) than A allele carriers (n,63), where the genotype explained 18% of such variation. However, the impact of genotype on postprandial TAG was evident only in men (P,0.04).

23457,"Next generation sequencing (NGS) is shedding light on the genetic causes of vascular anomalies and making it possible to combine tests for similar but distinct diseases. Vascular malformations (VMs) are a heterogeneous group of congenital circulatory malformations, characterized by morpho structural and/or functional defects of various nature, severity and extent. They may occur in any part of the body and any type of vessel (arteries, capillaries, veins and lymphatic vessels). Although most VMs are sporadic (simple or combined), syndromic and familial forms also exist with substan tial clinical overlap between lesions, and each can mimic the others. We designed a 25 gene NGS panel for VMs with Mendelian inheritance (au tosomal recessive, autosomal dominant or paradominant). Analysing 128 patients with sporadic congenital VMs, we identified 40 variations in 33 patients (25%). To estimate their pathogenicity, we looked up variations in dbSNP137, compared their frequency using data from the Exome Variant Server, evaluated the effect of protein amino acid substitution by in silico analysis, and also investigated the family if possible. Our results show that many genes can cause a wide variety of syndromic and non syndromic dis orders, confirming that genetic testing by NGS is useful and effective even in sporadic cases. Since the etiopathogenesis of many vascular lesions seems similar to that of tumours, we are screening tissue samples for mutations. Identification of causative genes and the possibility of tracing somatic mu tations in tissues could provide important information about disease free areas, useful for planning surgery to reduce the possibility of relapses.",2015

Recently reported pathological mutations identified in 15 of the aaRS2 genes have been associated with diverse clinical presentations, usually characterized by early onset and autosomal recessive transmission. Encephalopathy is the most common manifestation. Other clinical features include myopathy with anaemia, cardiomyopathy, tubulopathy and hearing loss. A relatively tight genotype phenotype correlation has been reported for most of these cases. We report 10 patients, from five unrelated families, with infantile onset mi tochondrial disorder (Nijmegen score >4) and two mutant alleles for EARS2 (p. R55H/p. G109R and p. R55H/p.

We hypo thesized that we could verify the sensitivity and specificity of GDF 15 and FGF21 as plasma biomarkers from our Mitochondrial Disease Biobank of over 300 individuals with a clinical diagnosis or suspicion of mitochondrial disease as determined by clinical, molecular, enzymatic, and/or histological findings. Methods: Thirty three participants with confirmed primary mitochondrial disease (MELAS, MERRF, NARP , CPEO,and others) provided EDTA plasma specimens. Age matched, control plasma for reference ranges were obtai ned from 120 Mayo Clinic Biobank donors, who did not have a clinical hi story of diabetes, cardiac, renal, or liver disease. Plasma GDF 15 and FGF21 were measured by ELISA and compared across cohorts. Results: Mitochondrial disease participants demonstrated plasma GDF 15 (median: 1163 pg/mL; 1st 99th% iles: 491 6817 pg/mL) and FGF21 (me dian: 486 pg/mL; 1st 99th% iles: 211 2816 pg/mL) levels that were hig her than the control cohort (GDF 15 median: 423 pg/mL; 1st 99th% iles: 230 1560 pg/mL and FGF21 median: 394 pg/mL;1st 99th% iles: 88 1658 pg/mL).

23461,"Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) is an autosomal recessive condition with an incidence of about 1 in 12,000 individuals. Over 90% of cases are due to mutations in the gene for 21 hydroxylase (CYP21A2) and ten mu tations account for the majority of those known. The presentation of CAH, classical, simple virilising or non classical, is related to mutation type. In recent years it has been recognised that carrier detection can be com plicated by rare haplotypes that contain duplicated copes of CYP21A2. Our Italian patient was tested as his partner had already been identified as a car rier for a mutation primarily associated with non classical CAH. His result showed that he is heterozygous for a classical CAH mutation, p.(Gln319Ter) but also that he has at least 3 copies of the CYP21A2 gene. Gln319Ter is a common CAH mutation associated with a classical to non classical phe notype depending on mutation combination. However, a rare European ha plotype has been described with Gln319Ter in the context of a duplication. Individuals who have this haplotype are therefore not carriers as there is a functional gene in cis. This rare haplotype is in linkage disequilibrium with rare variants, in intron 2 and the 3Ã¢ÂÂ untranslated region of CYP21A2, as well as HLA B50 Cw06 subtype, and has been reported in the Italian population.

23462,"Introduction: TMLHE deficiency is a very common inborn error of carnitine biosynthesis. The gene is X linked, and about 1 in 350 healthy males of Eu ropean descent have a deletion of exon 2 resulting in inability to synthesize carnitine. TMLHE deficiency likely is a risk factor for autism, but the pene trance for autism is less than 5%, and replication studies are needed. Materials and Methods: The frequency of exon 2 deletion was determined in 10,678 male samples undergoing array CGH for evaluation of heteroge neous disabilities and in 2124 male samples from the Baylor Mendelian Ge nome Center exome project. A case evaluation was performed on a TMLHE deficient male with autism and two episodes of regression. Results: Deletion of exon 2 of TMLHE was found in 50 of 10,678 males undergoing array CGH (0.46%) compared to 7 in 2245 males undergoing exome sequencing in the Mendelian studies (0.31%). The phenotypic data for the deficient males are being tabulated. Carnitine deficiency in a TMLHE case suggests that deficits in carnitine biosynthesis may be responsible for some cases of regression in individuals with autism. Conclusions: Deletion of exon 2 is confirmed to be very common in various clinical samples.

23463,"Chanarin Dorfman Syndrome (CDS), also known as Neutral Lipid Storage Disease with Ichthyosis (NLSD I), is a rare autosomal recessive lipid storage disease. This syndrome is characterized by non bullous congenital ichthyo siform eryhthroderma (NCIE), hepatomegaly and liver steatosis. Additional clinical features include muscle weakness, ataxia and sometimes neurosen sory hearing loss, subcapsular cataracts, nystagmus, strabismus and mental retardation. Patients are often born as collodion babies. ABHD5 gene mu tations have been identified as the cause of CDS. This gene codifies for the ÃÂ±/ÃÂ² hydrolase domain containing protein 5 (ABHD5), a co activator of the patatin like phospholipase domain containing protein 2 (PNPLA2). PNPLA2 is a lipase, associated to the lipid droplets surface, that catalyzes the initial step of triacylglycerols lipolysis. Until now, about 40 different mutations of ABHD5 gene are associated with CDS onset and 15 of them result in trun cated proteins. In a 29 month old Indian girl we have identified a homozygous nonsense mutation (c.297C>A) of ABHD5 gene, causing the production of a short trun cated protein (p. C99X). The little CDS patient presented NCIE, hepatomega ly, diffuse hepatic steatosis and splenomegaly. After the molecular confirma tion of CDS diagnosis, she was put on a low fat diet. Our results show that the early onset of CDS (in Indian patient) is probably due to the production of an ABHD5 protein which loses the putative inter acting domain required for PNPLA2 activation. Moreover, an early initiation of a diet poor in long chain fatty acids might improve the liver condition and prevent severe systemic damages.",2015
23464,"Introduction: Glycosylation is essential for human development. More than 100 clinically diverse inherited disorders are known to result from glyco sylation defects. One subtype of the congenital disorders of glycosylation (CDG) is caused by defects in glycosaminoglycan (GAG) synthesis. Here, we describe an infant from a consanguineous family with a GAG CDG. Pheno typic features include respiratory insufficiency, discrete skeletal anomalies, renal insufficiency, and T cell depletion. Methods: We performed whole exome sequencing (WES) on patient leu cocyte DNA to identify the causative mutation. Immunocytochemistry was conducted to characterize the identified mutations functionally in patient derived and control fibroblasts. Different GAG levels were measured in fi broblasts and urine from the patient and several controls. Results: Through WES we detected two homozygous missense mutations in highly conserved regions of two glycosylation genes regulating GAG syn thesis and modification. It remains unclear whether mutations in one or both of the genes contribute to the clinical phenotype. We found that one of the mutated proteins that normally localizes to the Golgi apparatus was absent in this organelle in patient cells. Immunocytochemical analysis of the other mutated protein failed. Finally, heparan sulphate GAG levels were si gnificantly reduced in patient derived fibroblasts, though within the normal range in urine. Conclusion: We describe an infant with multiple congenital anomalies. WES analysis revealed two mutations in two glycosylation genes. One of the mu tated proteins mislocalizes in patient derived fibroblasts. Our data indicate that this patient has a GAG CDG. Grants:",2015

Objectives: Migalastat (1 deoxygalactonojirimycin, AT1001) is an orally administered investigational pharmacological chaperone for Fabry disease that selectively binds and stabilizes ÃÂ± Gal A, leading to increased lysosomal activity. Study 011 (AT1001 011, NCT00925301) included a 6 month doub le blind placebo controlled period (Stage 1) and an 18 month open label ex tension. Sixty seven subjects were randomized; 48 subjects completed the study and continued in long term extension Study AT1001 041.Methods: Estimated GFR (eGFR) was assessed every 3 6 months using the CKD EPI and MDRD equations. Left ventricular mass index (LVMi) was as sessed by echocardiography every 6 12 months by a blinded central labo ratory. Gastrointestinal symptoms were assessed every 6 months using the Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale (GSRS). p values are unadjusted for multiple comparisons. Efficacy results are reported for the 50 subjects with amenable GLA mutations. Results: eGFR remained stable in subjects treated up to 48 months, with mean annualized eGFR changes (ÃÂ±SEM) of 0.80ÃÂ±0.60 (CKD EPI) and +0.70ÃÂ±0.80 (MDRD) mL/min/1.73m 2/yr.

The aim was to analyze spectrum of mutations in APOB, LDLR and PCSK9 genes in patients with clinical suspicion of FH. Materials and Methods: The p. Arg3527Gln mutation in APOB gene was te sted by real time PCR. The mutations in LDLR and PCSK9 genes were analy zed by Sanger sequencing. The large rearrangements in LDLR were assessed by MLPA analysis. Results: Out of 136 probands and 103 relatives, we have confirmed the pres ence of APOB mutation p. Arg3527Gln in 9 probands and 2 relatives, respec tively. In remaining 127 probands and 101 relatives, the presence of patho genic mutation in LDLR was confirmed in 58 probands and 49 relatives. All together, we have identified 41 mutations and 9 new variants in LDLR gene. Their potential pathogenicity predicted by in silico analysis was confirmed by cosegregation analysis in given families. Direct sequencing of PCSK9 gene revealed no pathogenic mutation. Conclusions: By DNA diagnostics, the clinical diagnosis of FH was confirmed in 49.3% probands and 49.5% of relatives. The high incidence of mutations in the genes analysed in our study emphasise the importance of genetic te sting for targeted treatment and prevention in families with FH in Slovakia.

23467,"Sinai, New York, NY, United States. Mutations in the ASAH1 gene lead to acid ceramidase deficiency, the resul tant accumulation of the lipid ceramide, and a distinct variety of disease phenotypes, culminating in two recognized diseases: Farber disease and Spinal Muscular Atrophy with Progressive Myoclonic Epilepsy (SMA PME). Farber disease represents a broad clinical spectrum presenting from infan cy through late childhood, associated with the pro inflammatory and pro apoptotic characteristics of ceramide. SMA PME, a late childhood onset, primarily neurologic disease, has been less well characterized to date, and the pathophysiologic mechanisms underlying the clinical manifestations are the subject of ongoing study. The prevalence of both diseases is currently unknown and awareness of them is limited due to their rarity; both are li kely underdiagnosed. We have collected data on over 20 living Farber patients, the largest cohort to date, including data on biochemical and immunologic phenotypes. Our findings reinforce the validity of the characteristic symptoms of Farber di sease: early onset polyarticular arthritis, subcutaneous nodules and dys phonia. However, it also reveals that there are patients who present with only one or two of these symptoms, and that the spectrum of disease inclu des remarkably attenuated forms with relatively little associated disability. We feel there is an indication for diligent screening of certain pediatric (and even young adult) polyarticular arthritis patients for Farber disease, and certain therapy resistant epilepsy patients for SMA PME. Such screening is being initiated and natural history studies are planned in both diseases. Recombinant human acid ceramidase enzyme therapy is currently under development and is expected to enter clinical trials in 2016.",2015
23468,"Fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) is a key regulator of phosphate homeo stasis. It plays a critical role in hereditary and acquired hypo and hyperphos phatemic disorders. Moreover, FGF23 has emerged as a promising biomar ker for the prediction of adverse clinical outcomes in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), since it might be related to mortality, cardiovascular abnormalities and disease progression. FGF23 is a bone derived endocrine factor that regulates renal tubular phosphate reabsorption and vitamin D metabolism by activating FGF receptor (FGFR)/Klotho complexes in the kid ney. Mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway is employed as a ma jor signalling pathway. To investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying FGF23 actions in more detail, we established a cell model of FGF23 inducible cells stably expressing Klotho (HEK293 KL cells). The FGF23 mediated in duction of HEK293 KL cells was shown by detecting the activation of MAPK pathway, which could be reduced by the use of two known small molecule inhibitors of this pathway: SU5402 and U0126. Based on our established cell model, reporter assays suited for high throughput screening (HTS) were de veloped to identify novel small molecule compounds that modulate FGF23 signalling. In a pilot screen, robustness and appropriateness of the method could be verified. The discovery of candidate hits would provide the basis to manipulate FGF23 signalling and would potentially validate this pathway as druggable in disorders caused by altered actions of FGF23.",2015

Bone crises in type 1 Gaucher disease are reported in long bones, in weight bearing bones and other bones, but rarely in the small bones of the hands and feet. Method: We retrospectively examined the incidence of bone crises, inclu ding small bone crises, in patients followed at the Rabin Medical Centre, Pe tah Tikva, Israel, before and following the initiation of imiglucerase enzyme replacement therapy (ERT). Results: Of 100 type I Gaucher disease patients, 30% experienced one or more bone crises. Small bone crises represented 31.5% of all bone crises and were preceded by crises in other bones. While the incidence of long bone crises decreased after the initiation of ERT , the incidence of small bone crises increased. Almost 60% of all patients with bone crises were of the N370S/84GG (representing only 30% of the cohort) suggesting a greater susceptibility of N370S/84GG patients to severe bone complications. These patients also underwent the greatest number of splenectomies (70.6% of all splenectomised patients) consistent with a more severe disease phenotype. Patients who underwent splenectomy showed a trend towards increased bone crises after surgery.

This study included 191 Kuwaiti children with TIDM and 101 controls (healthy, eth nically matched). The diagnosis of T1DM was based on the ISPAD criteria. The genotypes for PTPN22 gene variant C1858T (R620W) were identified by PCR RFLP . HLA DQ alleles were determined by sequence specific PCR in 178 patients. The presence of autoantibodies (ICA, INS and GAD) were de termined by radioimmunoassay. The variant genotype of the PTPN22 gene was detected in homozygous/heterozygous combination in 39% patients compared to 27% in controls. The homozygous TT genotype was detected in 8% patients compared to 0.99% in controls (p <0.001). Nine different combinations of HLA DQ alleles were detected in patients. In 55% patients, the genotype was either homozygous for DQ2 or in combination with a DQ8 allele. In 36% patients, the genotype was homozygous DQ8 or with other alleles.

23472,"Introduction: A family with 2 affected sibs presenting with congenital ca taract, progressive muscular hypotonia, hypotrophy, and psychomotor delay followed by severe neurological regression associated with seizures was fol lowed up for several years. The oldest sibling died at age 21 years, and her brother displays severe encephalopathy with cachexia. Along this diagno stic odyssey, a mitochondrial condition was suspected after morphological analysis of a muscle biopsy, exhibiting rare COX negative fibers. Whole exo me sequencing (WES) detected autosomal recessive truncating mutations in GFER. This gene has already been assigned in human pathology in three siblings born to healthy consanguineous Moroccan parents (Di Fonzo et al., 2009). The siblings carried a homozygous missense mutation in GFER, and presented a very similar phenotype including congenital cataract, progres sive muscular hypotonia, sensorineural hearing loss, developmental delay, scattered COX negative muscle fibres with moderate reduction of complex IV activity. Material and Methods: Through an international data sharing, another fa mily with two siblings has also been identified, also presenting with bila teral cataracts, global developmental delay, lactic acidosis, and increased mitochondrial DNA copy number. Similarly, the diagnostic approach in this family was WES. Results: These 7 cases issued from 3 families strongly support the existence of a new recognizable mitochondrial disorder associating progressive ence phalo myopathy with congenital cataract secundary to autosomal recessive mutations in the GFER gene.

23475,"Introduction: Consanguinity increases the coefficient of inbreeding and the likelihood of the presence of pathogenic mutations in homozygotic state. An SNP based microarray is a useful tool not only for studying copy num ber variants but also for the detection of uniparental disomy and regions of homozygosity (ROH) throughout the genome. Evaluation of ROH can gui de medical geneticists to focus on a single specific gene in order to achieve molecular diagnosis in families with common parental ethnic background or consanguinity. In addition, ROH analysis can eliminate genes as possible candidates in highly heterogeneous recessive conditions. Methods: We describe six cases in which analysis of SNP based microarrays (Illumina HumanOmniExpress 24 v1.0 BeadChip) has assisted us reaching molecular diagnosis in consanguineous families by sequencing a single can didate gene that was localized within homozygosity region. Results: We identified a disease causing mutation in all the families. All the genes are related to metabolic or neurological disorders and include: CRLF1 (Crisponi syndrome/CISS1 syndrome), PHKG2 (Glycogen storage disease IXc) NPC1 (Niemann Pick C disease), MPV17 (hepatocerebral mitochondrial DNA depletion), MAN2B1 (Alpha mannosidosis), and MOCS2 (Molybdenum cofactor deficiency).Conclusions: These examples demonstrate the great diagnostic value of SNP microarray in deciphering molecular defect in consanguineous families by minimizing the need for massive parallel sequencing and reducing the cost of the molecular work up.",2015

HSD10 is part of the mitochondrial RNase P enzyme com plex required for 5` end cleavage of mitochondrial precursor tRNAÃÂ´s. Here, we analyzed whether HSD17B10 mutations are linked to RNase P deficien cy. Methods : Expression of RNase P proteins was analyzed by Western blots. Real time RT PCR and Northern blot analysis were performed to quan tify mt tRNA processing in HSD10 knock down cells, patient (R130C and Q165H) and control fibroblasts. Results: HSD10 protein expression was strongly reduced in fibroblasts with mutation p. R130C which was associated with low expression of MRPP1 pro tein, an essential component of the RNase P complex. Knock down experi ments further revealed that expression of HSD10 is necessary for normal MRPP1 expression. Mutation p. Q165H shows equal amounts of HSD10 and MRPP1 protein than controls. Transcript analysis demonstrated that redu ced HSD10/MRPP1 expression resulted in an accumulation of precursor transcripts of mitochondrial heavy strand RNA. Furthermore, in fibroblasts with mutation p. Q165H mitochondrial RNA processing was equal than in controls. This finding correlates well with the observed phenotype in pati ents with mutation p. Q165H who exhibit normal development. Interestin gly, processing of light strand transcripts was not affected in patient cells. Conclusion : Our results indicate that HSD10 plays a crucial role in the HSD10/MRPP1 complex formation, and loss of HSD10 results in impaired mitochondrial tRNA processing of heavy strand transcripts. The findings provide a novel explanation for mitochondrial dysfunction observed in HSD10 disease.",2015

The etiology of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) remains poorly understood. Several molecular mechanisms have been proposed to explain how steatosis progresses to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis and hepatocellular carcinoma. One of them is altered methionine metabolism, which is coupled to the folate biosynthetic pathway. Herein, we report a multicenter association study of 756 biopsy proven NAFLD patients and controls, which together with various functional ap proaches allowed us to describe the role of the solute carrier family 19 (fola te transporter) member 1 (SLC19A1 ) gene in the development of NAFLD. Two (one missense) out of the three studied SNPs within SLC19A1 showed a significant association (p<10 3) with NAFLD for the single marker allelic test. In addition, minor homozygous genotypes were related to NAFLD cli nical features such as body mass index and serum levels of triacylglycerol (TAG) and transaminases. The functional role of SLC19A1 was studied in vitro using shRNA gene knockdown technologies in THLE2 cells, which caused intracellular folate content 4 fold lower than in the wild type cells. Furthermore, the lack of functional SLC19A1 significantly altered the expression of critical genes leading to spontaneous lipid droplet accumulation within cells. Lipidomic analyses showed that the most abundant stocked lipids were TAG and cho lesteryl ester species (the main known components of intracellular lipid droplets) as well as polyunsaturated fatty acids.

Fabry disease (FD) is a rare, progressive, metabolic disorder of glycosphin golipid storage and is caused by mutations in the gene encoding the lysoso mal hydrolase ÃÂ± galactosidase A (GLA). In males, the disease usually leads to a classic spectrum of symptoms including cardiomyopathy, nephropathy, acroparaesthesia, cornea verticillata and gastrointestinal problems and, eventually, myocardial infarction, renal failure or stroke. Certain circum stances complicate the diagnosis of the disease. (1) The X linked inheritance mode causes female heterozygotic mutation carriers to develop symptoms that are commonly milder and do not comprise the whole spectrum. (2) Mu tations that do not completely abolish ÃÂ± galactosidase A (AGAL) function usually manifest with milder disease. In collaboration with Centogene AG/Rostock we frequently detect new vari ants where the clinical significance is unclear (VUS). We utilize cell culture based over expression of the mutant cDNAs in order to objectify the disease potential of the variants by their in vitro enzyme activity. We introduce outline data for 25 patients harbouring novel GLA mutations (age of diagnosis, symptomatic spectrum) and oppose the data for in vitro enzyme activity and responsiveness to the pharmacological chaperone (PC) 1 Deoxygalactonojirimycine (DGJ), an alternate treatment for misfolding prone AGAL variants. We show increased prevalence of patients with GLA gene variants with an enzyme activity of >20%. Since these cases can lead to symptom onset later in life, a close clinical check up is demanded. The in vitro enzyme activity sy stem supports prediction of the pathologic progress of a given mutation and impacts decision making on time and type of therapeutic intervention.",2015
23482,"The m.3243A>G mutation is known as the MELAS ( mitochondrial myopa thy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis and stroke like episoodes) mutation. However many clinical phenotypes associated with this mutation have been described including maternally inherited diabetes and deafness (MIDD).The aim of the study was to describe clinical picture of Estonian patients with heteroplasmic m.3243A>G mutation referred to genetic councelling. Results: the common m.3243A>G point mutation was detected in eight pa tients from three families. In all of them (8/8) progressive hearing loss was detected, followed by diabetes mellitus (7/8), migraine (6/8), psychiatric disorders (3/8), brain atrophy(3/8) and hypertrofic left cardiomyopathy(2/8). Most of our patients (7/8) had thin build and short statur e. Clinically MELAS syndrome was diagnosed in four patients from two fami lies and MIDD in four patients from one family. Conclusions: Our results confirm the clinical heterogeneity of the m.3243A>G mutation. Progressive hearing loss is a first and universally pre sented feature in our small cohort. Therefore m.3243A>G mutation should be considered in patients with (progressive) hearing loss. There are some evidence that m.3243A>G mutation causes similar clinical pictures within the family. But as our cohort is small this conclusion need further wider cli nical investigation. ABSTRACTS POSTERS ESHG 2015 | GLASGOW, SCOTLAND, UK | WWW. ESHG. ORG 136Back to inde x",2015

23484,"Introduction: A growing body of evidence suggests that healthy diet is one of the major factors associated with metabolic health and changes in gut microbiota. Here we conducted a low salt, high fiber diet intervention trial on Korean adoptees, to assess alterations in gut microbiome composition in response to changes in diet and the associations with metabolic impro vement. Materials and methods: We developed a modified version of traditional Ko rean diet (K DASH), a high fiber, low fat, and low salt diet with a sufficient supply of fruits and nuts. 19 Korean adoptees (mean age: 29.4 years, male: 44.4 %) whose diets are mainly western style were recruited. 16S riboso mal RNA genes were extracted from stool samples at both pre and post intervention trial. The V4 region was amplified by PCR and sequenced using Illumina MiSeq platform. QIIME v.1.9.0 was used to estimate taxa from the sequenced reads. Results: The metabolic profiles, including weight, waist circumference, sy stolic blood pressure, high density lipids, and triglyceride levels, showed an improvement, except for fast blood sugar level. The gut microbiome profiles at the phylum level, Firmicutes were decreased, while Bacteroidetes were increased in abundance. The operational taxonomic unit that showed the most significant increase in abundance belonged to the family Leuconosto caceae, which is known to produce acetate and lactate (FDR corrected p , 0.0028). The change of triglyceride levels correlated with that of abundance of Actinobacteria (PearsonÃ¢ÂÂs correlation coefficient: 0.61, p,0.005).Conclusions: Our findings suggest that metabolic improvements induced by a short term changes of diet are mediated through their effects on the gut microbiome.",2015
23485,"A homozygous mutation c.460A>G in ACBD3 gene was found by whole exome sequencing in patient with mitochondrial encephalomyopathy and combined deficiency of respiratory chain complexes. ACBD3 encodes a 60 kDa acyl coenzyme A binding domain containing 3 protein (also known as PAP7 or GCP60) localized in the Golgi apparatus, endoplasmic reticulum, and mitochondria. ACBD3 protein plays an important role in many cellular processes (lipid metabolism, membrane transport, neuronal division, em bryogenesis, steroidogenesis, keeping the structure of the Golgi apparatus, apoptosis, iron homeostasis). In mitochondria, ACBD3 protein is a part of the complex (140 200kDa) mediating cholesterol transport into the organelle. An integral part of this complex is VDAC protein (Porin) which forms freely permeable pores in the outer mitochondrial membrane and further associates with ANT protein (adenine nucleotide transporter) in the inner mitochondrial membrane. ANT is an ADP/ATP carrier that controls a pool of mitochondrial adenine nucleotides required for mtDNA maintenance. The aim of the study is characterize the consequences of stably down regula ted expression of ACBD3 protein on the biogenesis and functions of OXPHOS complexes in HEK293 to elucidate its role in the pathogenesis of the patientÃÂ´s phenotype. The first results show that deficit of ACBD3 protein leads to the decrease of amount and activity of complex IV and decrease of selected sub units of complex IV.

23486,"Introduction: Anaemia represents a heterogeneous group of hematologic di seases, which can be induced by plenty of genetic and risk factors. Although the association of mitochondrial dysfunction and hematologic pathology is generally known, the underlying pathologic factors with regard to evolving anaemias are poorly characterized. In this study, we report on three pati ents, who manifested profound cytochrome c oxidase deficiency combined with anaemia. Methods: Genetic causes of patientsÃ¢ÂÂ defective OXPHOS system were found with the use of sequencing targeted to mitochondrial exome, application of SNP microarray chip and performance of protein studies in affected patient tissues. Results: The presence of pathologic mutations was excluded in patientsÃ¢ÂÂ mitochondrial DNA. A rarely occurring pathological 6 kbp homozygous deletion was identified in two unrelated patients affecting the PUS1 gene, which remarkably leads to different disease phenotypes in both patients. Two previously characterized deleterious missense sequence variations of COX10 gene (p. Asn204Lys; p. Pro225Leu) were identified in the third pati ent, however, their combination has not been reported yet, which may imply the variant patient disease phenotype. Conclusions: Based on our results and current knowledge, we suggest the infantile deficiency of PUS1 and COX10 to be classified as the early fatal and slow progressive forms. To conclude, mitochondrial disorders manifest poor phenotype genotype correlation even in the patient with the same causal mutations.

23487,"Next generation sequencing (NGS) panels have expanded the number of genes that can be simultaneously investigated and are an attractive option because of their increased efficiency and reduced cost. Design of the 448 gene nuclear mitochondrial NGS panel included genes that are involved in various mitochondrial functions ranging from oxidative phosphorylation, transcription/ translation, mtDNA synthesis/biogenesis, and mitochondrial regulation. These genes also include those associated with conditions that ABSTRACTS POSTERS ESHG 2015 | GLASGOW, SCOTLAND, UK | WWW. ESHG. ORG 137Back to inde x may mimic mitochondrial disease. We evaluated 43 Nuclear Mitome NGS cases to determine the most commonly reported and phenotypically infor mative genes. We reported Sanger confirmed variants in 372 of 448 genes. Overall about 65% of variants could be categorized into one of three mito chondrial disease associated subtypes: oxidative phosphorylation subunits, mitochondrial regulatory function, or conditions mimicking mitochondrial disease. About 43% of reported variants were in genes that cause similar clinical phenotypes, 20% were in genes that code for oxidative phosphoryla tion subunits, and 9.8% were related to regulatory function. The ten most reported genes (RYR1, WFS1, POLG, SCN1A, MTFMT , TTBK2, ABCD1, MYH7, ATM, and ATXN7) accounted for over 15% of all reported variants. Six of these ten genes are associated with conditions that may mimic mitochon drial disease. They may not be directly related to mitochondrial function but these patientsÃ¢ÂÂ phenotypes prompted suspicion for mitochondrial disease demonstrating the importance of using NGS testing early in the diagnostic process for economic and efficiency purposes. Our results support the use of NGS panels to identify a potential diagnosis in cases of non specific clinical features or mitochondrial disease like symptoms.",2015

The Scheme challenged participants of the 2014 mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) EQA run by distributing a validated sample with a very low level of mtDNA heteroplasmy (3% mutated mtDNA in circulating lymphocytes) of the m.3243A>G MTTL1 mutation, resulting in a third of all participants reporting a critical genotyping error. Thirty six percent of laboratories were either unable to identify the m.3243A>G mutation present at this low level or failed to state the sensiti vity of their quantitative assay to determine mtDNA heteroplasmy in their report. Various testing methods were used for analysis and erroneous re sults were even reported by laboratories claiming to have test sensitivity as low as 1%.The results of the EQA scheme highlighted that when reporting quantitati ve assessment of mtDNA mutation loads it is crucial that test sensitivity is included on reports to enable the reader to correctly interpret the result. Furthermore, if a diagnostic laboratory is using a test for the heteroplas mic m.3243A>G mutation which cannot reliably detect <10% mutant load then it is recommended that an alternative, more sensitive, testing strategy is employed or that an alternative, non invasive DNA sample (e.g. urinary sediment) in which this mutation is known to segregate to higher levels, is routinely screened in patients referred for m.3243A>G testing.",2015
23489,"As the recognition of mitochondrial diseases has increased, the spectrum of clinical manifestations has expanded to include organ systems such as gastrointestinal tract, kidney and liver. Here, we report our efforts to iden tify the pathogenetic cause for a patient, born to healthy consanguineous parents, who presented since the neonatal period a constellation of sym ptoms suggestive of a mitochondrial disorder: chronic diarrhea, failure to thrive, tubulopathy, hepatic cytolysis with a complex IV deficiency of the mitochondrial respiratory chain (MRC) in liver. Mutations in mitochondri al DNA and nuclear candidate genes have been excluded. Whole Exome Sequencing (WES) of the patient identified a homozygous missense vari ant c.347G>A (p. Cys116Tyr) in the EPCAM gene, which is known to cause Congenital Tufting Enteropathy (CTE), a rare autosomal recessive diar rheal disorder. Additionally a homozygous missense mutation c.1870A>G (p.

The two variants are novel, occur in highly con served amino acids, are predicted to be damaging and are present in the he terozygous state in the parents and the asymptomatic sister. This patientÃ¢ÂÂs complex phenotype reflects a complex genetic etiology in which no single gene explained the complete clinical presentation, but rather more than one mutant locus is involved.

23490,"Mitochondrial disorders are often fatal multisystem disorders. Due to ex treme clinical and genetic heterogeneity of these diseases, establishing a genetic diagnosis is challenging. Mitochondrial disorders can be caused by mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) mutations, accounting for ~15% of cases, or by nuclear genetic defects. To date, mutations have been found in ~200 nu clear genes in mitochondrial patients but many disease genes still have to be discovered. Development of whole exome sequencing (WES) has revolutionized our ap proach to uncover disease causing mutations in known and novel mitochon drial disease genes. We performed WES analysis on ~50 (consanguinous or non consanguinous) patients with suspected mitochondrial disease and no mtDNA or POLG1 mutations, filtering the exome data based on the presu med genetic model (mostly autosomal recessive). So far, in ~35% of these patients a clear (~25%) or probable (~10%) genetic cause has been iden tified; most (~2/3) of these are mutations in known mitochondrial genes while ~1/3 are not previously linked to mitochondrial disease. Therefore, WES has now been implemented in our laboratory as a diagnostic test for patients with suspected mitochondrial disease, starting with a mito chondrial gene panel of ~450 genes for initial filtering. In case the causal ge netic defect is not found, filtering the complete exome data (Ã¢ÂÂOpen ExomeÃ¢ÂÂ) based on the presumed genetic model can be performed as a second step. For most novel candidate genes and mutations, however, functional testing is required to prove pathogenicity or, alternatively, identification of similar gene mutations in patients with comparable phenotypes, demonstrating the value of data sharing.",2015

Demonstrative example are infant myo pathies. Different manifestations of congenital myopathy may mask mtDNA alterations. Oftimes mitochondrial disorders are not suspected and mani fest unexpectedly. In this regard, molecular mtDNA testing is getting increa singly important as a stage of diagnostics. Materials and methodsWe researched unexplained infant myopathy cases with manifestation of muscle hypoxia. First, we analyzed mitochondrial distribution in the tissue. Then, we explored distribution of Hypoxia Inducible Factor 1 alpha (HIF1a) to evaluate hypoxia. For this stage, we used polyclonal rabbit antibodies to HIF1a and secondary antibodies AlexaFluor555 goat anti rabbit IgG. The reafter we made complete mtDNA sequence with Sanger method and capil lary electrophoresis. Results Histological research of muscle tissue revealed ragged red fibers. More interestingly, we found loci with both HIF1a high concentration sites and increased mitochondrial clusters. In the light of these findings, we analy zed complete mtDNA sequence in order to find pathological mutations. We found no confirmed disease associated mutations.

23492,"Introduction: Sperm mitochondria are one of the major sources and targets of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Furthermore, mitochondrial dysfunction is reported to be an early indicator of sperm damage. The aim of this study was to evaluate the influence of oxidative stress, as assessed by seminal oxidati on protein level, on mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) of sperm. Materials and Methods: Study population included 25 male partners of in fertile couples. Were excluded men with known male factor of infertility and/or low ejaculate volume (<1.5 mL) and/or low sperm count (< 15 Mil lion/mL), evaluated according to WHO 2010 recommendations. MMP was determined by flow cytometry using 3,3Ã¢ÂÂ dihexyloxacarbocyanine iodide (DiOC6) as probe. Seminal plasma level of advanced oxidation protein pro ducts (AOPP), a marker of oxidative stress, was assessed by spectrophoto metry. The relationship between semen parameters, sperm MMP and AOPP levels were analyzed (SpearmanÃ¢ÂÂs Rank correlation test). Results: Nearly one third of the participants (n,8) had normal semen pa rameters. Among the remaining participants, 70 % had a single parameter below WHO reference values. Sperm progressive motility was significantly correlated with MMP (r,+0.44; p,0.02). We found a negative correlation between AOPP seminal level and sperm concentration (r, 0.40; p,0.04). There was no association between AOPP level and MMP (p,0.9).Conclusion: In accordance with previous studies, sperm MMP was a sensiti ve indicator of functional integrity of the spermatozoa. The lack of associa tion between MMP and AOPP level could be related to the relatively good semen quality of the participants in this study. Indeed, semen vulnerability to oxidative damage is strongly linked to semen quality and its antioxidant capacity.",2015
23493,"Maturity Onset Diabetes of the Young (MODY) is genetically heterogeneous disorder. Generally, only few genes with most prevalent mutations are se quenced according to patient phenotype. In this study, we used targeted NGS sequencing of a panel of MODY genes in patients, where no mutation had been found in one or two most probable genes by Sanger sequencing. Patients and Methods: We designed a custom targeted sequencing panel focusing on 13 known MODY genes (HNF4A, GCK, HNF1A, PDX1, HNF1B, NEUROD1, KLF11, CEL, PAX4, INS, BLK, ABCC8, KCNJ11). The target regi ons (exons with 50bp padding, UTRs and promoters) were sequenced using PGM IonTorrent platform. Missing and low coverage fragments, as well as candidate variants, were sequenced by Sanger. We have analyzed 21 pati ents with MODY phenotype negative for most probable genes. Results: Designed panel covered 93.7% of target sequences and, out of the se, 98.1% were covered more than 20x. Analysis of data revealed 3 known mutations: in GCK, ABCC8 and HNF1B genes, and 2 novel likely pathoge nic mutations in ABCC8 and HNF4A genes. We have also found additional 3 variants in HNF1B, PAX4 and BLK genes with unknown significance. Co segregation analysis with diabetes in the families did not support their pa thogenicity.

23495,"Background: In general, there is increasing recognition that accessory pro teins can modulate G protein coupled receptor (GPCR) trafficking, ligand binding and signaling to the cell surface. In vitro studies showed that me lanocortin receptor 2 accessory protein 2 (MRAP2) can interact with the melanocortin 3 (MC3R) and 4 receptor (MC4R), two GPCRs which play an important role in the leptin melanocortin signaling. MRAP2 is located on chromosome 6q14.2, a region which is associated with a Prader Willi like (PWL) phenotype, a syndromic form of obesity. In addition, Asai et al. identi fied four rare heterozygous variants in four unrelated, nonsyndromic, seve rely obese individuals. Therefore we decided to perform mutation analysis in both a PWL and obese cohort. Method: We screened 122 PWL patients and 404 obese children and ado lescents for mutations in MRAP2 using high resolution melting curve ana lysis. Sanger sequencing was performed for samples with melting patterns deviating from wild type. Results and conclusions: Mutation analysis of all coding exons and in tron exon boundaries of MRAP2 resulted in the identification of one rare non synonymous heterozygous variant A40S (c.118G>T) in one PWL pati ent. Screening of the 404 obese individuals didnÃ¢ÂÂt lead to any variants in the gene. In silico analysis showed a probably damaging effect of the A40S variant on the protein structure of MRAP2. Further functional analysis is necessary to investigate the influence of the variant on the MRAP2 function. This would indicate a possible role of MRAP2 in the pathogenesis of Prader Willi like phenotype, albeit in a limited number of patients.",2015
23496,"Introduction: Enzyme replacement therapy (Elaprase) has been used for treatment of patients with mucopolysaccharidosis type II (MPS II) for the last eight years. During this time only few early diagnosed infants have been ABSTRACTS POSTERS ESHG 2015 | GLASGOW, SCOTLAND, UK | WWW. ESHG. ORG 139Back to inde x treated. Therefore, data on treatment effectiveness in this age group is very limited. Case presentation: We present unexpected therapeutic findings in one of two affected siblings. In the older patient first symptoms of MPS II were no ticed at the age of three years and diagnosis was established two years later. At the age of seven years, typical dysmorphism, restriction of joint move ments, heart involvement, hepatomegaly and severe intellectual delay could be observed. In the younger patient diagnosis of MPS II was made in the first month of life. Treatment with Elaprase was introduced in the third month of life. At the age of seven years the patient remains clinically symptom free (including normal intellectual development) despite presence of typical biochemical abnormalities. In both patients activity of iduronate 2 sulfatase in leukocytes was below norm and a missense mutation of the iduronate 2 sulfatase gene (p. Tyr523Cys) was detected. Conclusion: Although hampering of some symptoms could be explained with beneficial effects of Elaprase, normal intellectual development in the younger patient is unexpected. One possible explanation could be decreased disease penetration. However, similar extent of biochemical abnormalities in both patients suggests similar disease severity. Therefore, in our opinion possibility of significant attenuation of disease course should be considered as a result of early introduction of enzyme replacement therapy.",2015

Hospital Universitario Vall dÃ¢ÂÂHebron, Barcelona, Spain. Thymidine kinase 2 (TK2) is a mitochondrial enzyme participating in the salvage of deoxyribonucleotides needed as substrates for mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) replication. TK2 mutations were typically associated with a severe myopathic form of mtDNA depletion syndrome that manifests du ring infancy and leads to the early death of most patients. Recently, several patients (n,7) have been diagnosed with a late onset and milder myopathy with multiple mtDNA deletions. Here we describe seven patients diagnosed in their adulthood (16 55 years old), with different forms of mitochondrial myopathy associated with multiple mtDNA deletions and no depletion in skeletal muscle, in contrast to what is observed in typical infantile patients. Phenotypic presentation varied from mild myopathic signatures, such as ptosis and myalgia, to progressive muscle weakness and respiratory dys function. After genetic analysis, previously reported pathogenic mutations in TK2 were identified in all patients (p. K202del and p. T108M that seem particularly frequent in the Spanish population, and p. R192K). Fibroblasts were obtained from two of these patients and TK2 activity was measured showing a drastic reduction that resembled that found in typical paedia tric patients (3% and 6% residual activity as compared with age matched healthy controls). This observation suggests that redundant or complemen tary biochemical mechanisms can bypass the biochemical defect in some individuals, preventing mtDNA depletion, and ameliorating the course of the disease. Therefore, TK2 mutations should be investigated in patients with myopathy associated with either mtDNA depletion or multiple deletions, independently of their age at onset or clinical severity.

The siblings presen ted with striking cervico thoracic lipomatosis in their 40Ã¢ÂÂs, with tongue hy pertrophy and impaired swallowing, diabetes, and a peripheral neuropathy.

In silico programs pre dict it to be pathogenic and heterozygous carriers of the MFN2 p. R707W substitution are known to have Charcot Marie Tooth disease (CMT). A third, unrelated, patient with multiple symmetrical lipomatosis and neuropathy also harbored the same homozygous mutation and had been previously dia gnosed with CMT . Functional studies in patient fibroblasts demonstrate that the p.

23499,"Isolated complex I deficiency is the most common paediatric mitochondrial disease presentation and the prognosis is often poor with high mortality. Complex I comprises 44 structural subunits with at least 10 ancillary pro teins involved in its assembly; mutations in at least 25 of these have been reported as causal. There are limited genotype phenotype correlations to guide clinicians to the correct genetic diagnosis, although next generation sequencing strategies including exome sequencing have proven extremely useful in a research setting. In a diagnostic setting, it is crucial to provide a genetic diagnosis in a rapid and cost effective manner and we apply a va lidated, targeted next generation sequencing strategy to sequence the ge nes encoding all structural subunits and ancillary proteins in clinically and biochemically characterised paediatric patients. This strategy has uncove red a clinically distinctive cohort of children of small stature, with persi stent growth retardation and mild dysmorphic facial features (n,7 patients from 6 families) who are all homozygous for a previously reported c.64T>C, p.

Our cohort highlights that the long term prognosis related to this NDUFB3 mutation can be very good, and recognition of the distinctive facial features should suggest screening for this specific mutati on to provide a genetic diagnosis, circumventing the requirement of muscle biopsy to direct molecular genetic investigations.",2015
23500,"Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is one of the most common monogenic disorders mostly inherited as autosomal dominant trait and when untreated results in early coronary heart disease. Identification and early treatment of affected individuals remains a challenge worldwide. Majority of FH cases are caused by mutations in four genes (APOB, LDLR, PCSK9 and LDLRAP1). The spectrum of disease causing mutations is very diverse and mutation pa nels commonly used in diagnostics cover only a minority of disease causing genetic variants. In FH patients not expressing the physical symptoms and with unknown family history DNA based tests may provide the route to FH diagnosis. Here, we evaluate the use of targeted next generation sequencing (NGS) as a potential method to identify cases of FH in the cohort of coronary artery disease (CAD) patients and individuals with abnormal low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL C) levels.

In total 22 synonymous, 31 non synonymous variants, eight variants in close pro ximity (10 bp) of intron exon boundaries and 50 other variants were found. We identified 4 pathogenic mutations (Arg3527Gln in APOB gene, Gly20Arg, Arg350X and IVS11 10 (G>A) in LDLR gene) in seven patients (7.6 %). In addition 3 possible pathogenic variants were also found in four patients.

23501,"Niemann Pick disease type C (NPC) is a rare autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disorder, resulting from abnormal cholesterol trafficking. NPC has a heterogeneous clinical presentation, but is typically characterised by a ran ge of progressive neurological problems. Traditionally, a biochemical laboratory diagnosis is made by demonstrating impaired cholesterol trafficking via filipin stained fibroblast cultures, requi ring an invasive skin biopsy. A more sensitive and specific LC MS/MS me thod for quantifying cholesterol oxidation products, shown to be increased in the plasma of NPC patients is now available in Manchester as a new first line test, allowing less invasive, rapid screening of this previously under diagnosed disease. Currently, molecular analysis of NPC following abnormal biochemical scree ning results, involves direct Sanger sequencing of all 30 exons of the NPC1 and NPC2 genes combined. However, a more robust efficient approach was required to meet the potential increase in demand for NPC genetic testing. We have developed a more comprehensive sensitive mutation screening service for both NPC1 and NPC2 using a combination of MLPA and Next Ge neration Sequencing (NGS). The latter is based on enrichment by long range PCR, amplicon normalisation, equimolar pooling and dilution, fragmentati on and tagging using Nextera XT followed by MiSeq NGS, with a minimum coverage of 100x reads. Analysis using a custom bioinformatics pipeline al lows a range of point variants and small insertion/deletion mutations to be accurately identified. In addition, the cholesterol oxidation levels from a number of patients were compared to their genotypes and good concordance between the two tests was revealed.",2015
23502,"Introduction: Biomarkers are a relevant factor in diagnosing and monitoring many different diseases. The ideal biomarker detects the presence, extent and outcome of a specific disease and is reliably quantifiable in a clinically easily accessible sample. For Niemann Pick Type C (NP C), an autosomal re cessive disease caused by mutations in either the NPC1 gene (95% of all pa tients) or NPC2 gene (5% of all patients) biomarkers have been established in the past, which facilitate either early diagnosis (cholestane 3ÃÂ²,5ÃÂ±,6ÃÂ² triol; Jiang et al. 2011) or long term follow up (Lysotracker Assay measu ring relative acidic compartment volume; TeVruchte et al., 2014). However, early diagnosis and monitoring of treatment in patients is still difficult and the existing markers are not really reflecting the disease burden. Material and Methods: Based on a new LC/MRM MS (liquid chromatogra phy/multiple reaction monitoring mass spectrometry) assay we developed and validated a novel biomarker, lyso Sphingomyelin 509. Primary detec tion of the biomarker was performed in 10 NP C patients and 10 controls. Further validation of the biomarker was performed in 242 subjects inclu ding NP C patients, NP C carriers, healthy controls and patients with other LSDs. Results: In total, 242 subjects were investigated, including 110 NP C patients (lyso Sphingomyelin 509: 6.7ng/ml (IQR: 3.4 10.3ng/ml)), 63 NP C carriers and 43 healthy controls. With a sensitivity of 100% and specificity of 91% a cut off of 1.4ng/ml was established. Neither NP C carriers nor healthy con trols displayed elevated measurements of lyso Sphingomyelin 509.Conclusion: Lyso Sphingomyelin 509 has been established as a sensitive and specific biomarker for NP C. Tracking the disease progression and response to treatment by this surrogate biomarker is currently under investigation.",2015

23504,"Genetics & Pharmacogenomics (GpGx), Boston, MA, United States. Niemann Pick Type C Disease (NP C) is a rare, autosomal recessive lysoso mal storage disease. Two causative genes, NPC1 and NPC2, have been identi fied with mutations in NPC1 contributing to the large majority of cases. In 2007 we established a locus specific gene variation database that listed variants and associated haplotypes in NPC1 and NPC2 genes and related se quence to basic clinical information. Since then our knowledge has grown and next generation sequencing studies of larger patient and control co horts have provided us with further insights into the genetic architecture of NPC1 and NPC2, enabling a much better understanding of which genetic variation within these genes is truly disease relevant. Using a variety of sources, we have now assembled over 1400 exonic and intronic variants at the NPC1 and around 50 variants at the NPC2 locus and provide information on their functional consequences. Additionally, our re source provides information on allele frequencies, in silico predictions of the functional effects of a variant and allele numbers in controls and repor ted patients. As a result it assists in evaluating the significance of a variant and thus aims to support molecular diagnostician in their challenge of ma king the correct diagnosis. In recent years, efforts have been made to establish a clinical registry for Niemann Pick diseases called Ã¢ÂÂThe International Niemann Pick Disease Re gistryÃ¢ÂÂ. As we are collaborators in this project we aim to intertwine both registries, thus securing an ongoing input of information on the number and types of variants found in actual NP C patients.

Obesity is associated with impaired lipid metabolism and cholesterol accu mulation in the intra abdominal adipose tissue. ATP binding cassette trans porters ABCA1 and ABCG1 play a major role in cholesterol efflux suggesting their role in elimination of excess cholesterol and maintaining cholesterol homeostasis in the adipocyte. RAR related orphan receptor RORÃÂ± have been implicated as one of the regulators of the lipid metabolism and may play a significant role in the regulation of ABÃÂ¡A1 and ABCG1 expression. However, the effect of RORÃÂ± on ABCA1 and ABCG1 protein content in visceral fat du ring obesity is unknown. The aim of this study is to investigate correlation between orphan recep tor RORÃÂ± and transporters ABCA1, ABCG1 in visceral adipose tissue with obesity. Visceral fat was received from gastrocolic omentum during laparoscopic cholecystectomy from 37 individuals. Protein levels of ABCA1, ABCG1 and RORÃÂ± were measured by western blot. All individuals were divided in 3 subgroups: morbidly obese (BMIÃ¢ÂÂ¥31; N,8), overweight (25Ã¢ÂÂ¤BMI<31; N,15) and normal weight (BMI<25; N,14). AB CA1 and ABCG1 protein levels were significantly higher in individuals with overweight when compared with normal weight (p<0.01; p<0.05, respec tively). A positive correlation between RORÃÂ± and ABCA1( r,0.48; p<0.05) as well as ABCG1( r,0.43; p<0.05) levels in visceral fat was shown. These data suppose that RORÃÂ± may control ABCA1 and ABCG1 protein levels in visceral fat tissue and thus influence on the obesity development.

23506,"Introduction: Some forms of obesity are monogenic. We investigated the prevalence of monogenic obesity in super obese adults, and examined their weight loss trajectories after bariatric surgery. Methods: A cohort of patients (n,282) with a body mass index (BMI) of >50 kg/m2 were screened for MC4R deficiency. 48 patients (BMI range: 50.2 103.8 kg/m2) were selected for further whole exome sequencing (WES) to screen for other pathogenic mutations in known obesity genes. Copy num ber variation analysis was carried out by read depth analysis, and Sanger sequencing or real time PCR was used to confirm findings. Results: Screening identified one patient carrying a rare MC4R mutation (E42K) predicted to be pathogenic. Five out of 48 patients (10.4%) inve stigated by WES carried a likely monogenic cause of their obesity: 16p11.2 deletion; a deletion within NTRK2; a nonsense mutation in IGSF1 ; and mis sense mutations in SH2B1 and NTRK2. In addition, in a further six patients, novel or rare (population frequency <0.005) missense mutations, reported as pathogenic by multiple prediction tools, were found in LEPR (compound heterozygote), NTRK2, SH2B1 or MAGEL2 (three). Weight loss seen in the mutation carriers was not different one year after bariatric surgery from patients with a similar starting BMI. Conclusion: MC4R screening and WES data revealed a markedly higher dia gnostic yield (up to 22.9%) than previously reported in any obese cohort.

Of the four nuclear encoded proteins composing CII (SDHA, SDHB, SDHC, SDHD) and its assembly factors (SDHAF1 and SDHAF2) mainly recessively inherited mutations cause mitochondrial disease phenotypes. Here we report clinical, biochemical and molecular investigations of three patients harbouring a heterozygous mutation in the flavoprotein subunit SDHA previously associated with CII deficiency. The index patient presented with optic atrophy, ocular movement disorder, progressive polyneuropathy, psychiatric involvement and cardiomyopathy. His daughter deceased at the age of 7 months due to cardiac insufficiency. His 30 year old son presents with optic atrophy and cardiomyopathy. Spectrophotometric and oxygen consumption measurements in skin fibroblasts revealed isolated CII defici ency in all patients. Sequencing of all complex II associated genes revealed a previously described heterozygous mutation (c.1351C>T; p. R451C) in SDHA in a highly conserved Flavin binding domain. Only few SDH gene defects are reported as an underlying cause of mitochon drial disease. However, SDH genes as tumor suppressor genes are frequently associated with hereditary cancer syndromes, including paraganglioma and pheochromocytoma and should be monitored also in patients presenting with mitochondrial disease.

This is important in recent progress of PKU treatment and in the correlation between PAH residual activity and tetrahydrobiopterin therapy. The most worldwide fre quent mutations of the PAH gene have been studied in vitro and in silico in the last two decades. In our recent study, three novel missense mutations were identified in the Slovak population (p. F233I, p. R270I and p. F331S). We cloned these variants in the pMAL MBP fusion vector and expressed in E. coli XL1 blue expression system. Enzymes were isolated using affinity chro matography followed by size exclusion chromatography. Wild type PAH and each mutated form were assayed and their activity was measured by quanti fication of produced tyrosine using tandem mass spectrometry. The residual activity of each mutation was assessed as percentual activity of the wild type enzyme. To clarify and extend the results, we changed experimental condi tions by co overexpressing each mutation with pGroESL plasmid (carrying chaperone genes GroEL and GroES).

In one patient, targeted treatment with Sodium Phenylbutirate has been described. We report of two siblings, born to consanguineous parents of Arab Muslim descent, who presented with macrocephaly, absence seizures, and gastro intestinal bleedings due to portal vein thrombosis. An extensive diagnostic evaluation was futile, including Whole Exome Sequencing (WES) which failed to establish a diagnosis. However, focused sequencing of the PIGM gene including its promotor region found the patients to be homozygous for the 270C>G mutation previously described. One of the siblings died awating liver transplantation, while the other is treated with Sodium Phenylbutirate with improvement in her seizure frequency and severity. Finally, during a new pregnancy, prenatal diagnosis was pursued via amniocentesis, and un fortunately had found the fetus as homozygous for the same mutation. A third affected sibling was born, and at 7 months of age had already shown portal vein thrombosis, as well as evidence of cerebral infarct, and Sodium Phenylbutirate treatment was initiated.

According to recent data vitamin E could be effective in reducing oxidative stress in SLOS patients. We have started vitamin E treatment (in addition to cholesterol supplementation) in seven SLOS patients. Starting daily doses of RRR alpha tocopheryl acetate were 230 mg for young patients (age group: 4 to 10 years) and 2x230 mg above 10 years of age. Plasma vitamin A and E concentrations of the patients were monitored monthly by HPLC method. Behavioral effects of the treatment were determined using the Aberrant Behavior Checklist (ABC). All patients had vitamin E deficiency before the treatment, while vitamin A concentra tions were normal in all but one patient. Vitamin E levels reached reference range in five patients after one month and remained stable. According to four scores (irritability, lethargy, stereotypic behavior, hyperactivity) of ABC no positive effect on behavior could be detected after 3 months. The fact that our patients were vitamin E deficient but vitamin A concentrations were in the normal range except for one patient suggests a higher utilization of vitamin E and not an inadeqaute absorption.

In this study we used fibroblasts from Smith Lemli Opitz syndrome patients (SLOS) a metabolic genetic disease affec ting the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway to investigate the consequences of cholesterol deficiency on cell morphology and protein expression. Materials and methods : Morphological studies (MTT test, immunocytoche mistry for LC3, MDC and acridine orange coloration as well as electron mi croscopy) and proteomic analysis (iTRAQ LC /MS MS) were performed on fibroblasts from SLOS patients and human controls, simultaneously cultiva ted both on standard conditions and cholesterol depleted media. Results: Morphological studies showed that when endogenous synthesis of cholesterol is inadequate (SLOS) and there is no appropriate supply to over come cellular needs (cholesterol depleted media), cell proliferation in vitro becomes impaired and autophagy is activated. Furthermore, SLOS cells in cholesterol depleted medium show an overex pression of a set of proteins. Mainly, these cells seems to increase MnSOD expression to combat oxidative stress derived from the increased amount of 7 dehydrocholesterol and its derivatives, caused by the inherited enzy matic deficiency and thus control cell proliferation, whereas heat shock 70 kDa protein 4, an autophagic protein (Atg2) also presents a cytoprotective activity and inhibits apoptosis. Conclusion: We conclude that the mechanism by which SLOS fibroblasts handles their metabolic deficit, involves autophagy which plays an impor tant role in cell survival. Furthermore this work provided powerful indica tions that may be useful to expand the knowledge about the mechanisms involved in cellular pathophysiology of SLOS.

23516,"Obesity is frequently associated with metabolic complications such as hyper tension, diabetes and cardiovascular diseases. Obesity is a complex disease with high heritability estimates (> 0.70). Glucagon like Peptide 1 receptor (GL1PR) plays important roles in glucose homeostasis and inhibition of ap petite by acting on brain. On the other hand, Serotonin Receptor (HTR2A) is a neurotransmitter which works closely with leptin and insulin in metabolic response to dietary intake. It is largely unclear whether genetic variations in these receptor genes lead to individual differences in susceptibility to me tabolic complications. Therefore we investigated the associations of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of GL1PR and HTR2A genes with obesity and metabolic traits. A total of 676 Malaysian Malays, obese (n,197) and non obese (n,479) were genotyped for the GL1PR rs2268641 and HTR2A rs912127 SNPs. Anthropometric, fasting plasma glucose, body fat and lipid levels were measured. Data were analyzed using Multivariate linear models. After adjusting the age and gender, it was found that GL1PR rs2268641 was significantly associated with hip circumference (HC), (p,0.015).

23518,"Thioredoxin 2 (TXN2) is a mitochondrial redox protein, which is ubiquitous ly expressed with the highest expression levels in brain tissue. It is encoded by a nuclear gene, TXN2, containing a mitochondrial targeting sequence. TXN2 plays a crucial role in oxidative stress defense and in the regulation of the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway. Animal studies suggest that TXN2 is essential during embryonic development. Using exome sequencing in a 15 year old adolescent suffering from an early onset neurodegenerative disorder with severe cerebellar atrophy, epilepsy, peripheral neuropathy, dystonia and combined respiratory chain deficiency in muscle tissue, we identified a homozygous stop mutation in TXN2. TXN2 protein was not detectable in patient fibroblasts, confirming the predicted loss of function. Cellular studies revealed increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, impaired oxidative stress defence and secondary mitochondri al dysfunction with reduced cellular respiration and diminished ATP pro duction. Lentiviral expression of TXN2 restored all these parameters con firming the causal role of the mutation. Supplementations with antioxidants effectively suppressed cellular ROS production, and lead to moderate clini cal improvement during short term follow up of the patient.

More than 500 distinct mutations have been described in the ATP7B gene, from which 380 have a confirmed role in the pathogenesis of the disease (Wilson disease mutation database: http://www.wilsondi sease.med.ualberta.ca/database.asp .). The most common mutation in the ABSTRACTS POSTERS ESHG 2015 | GLASGOW, SCOTLAND, UK | WWW. ESHG. ORG 145Back to inde x Europe is H1069Q. Materials and methods. In total 235 patients have been sent for WD DNA diagnostics in Latvia. All the patients were first tested for the most common mutation H1069Q, by using PCR Bi PASA method; 64 patients, clinically confirmed with WD, whe re the mutation H1069Q was not be found in both alleles, were tested for other possible mutations (in the exons 2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 11, 13, 14, 16, 18 of gene ATP7B Ã¢ÂÂ exons having the most common prevalence of mutations in WD patients) by direct sequencing. Results. Wilson disease was genetically confirmed in 42 patients. In total 68.94% of WD patientsÃ¢ÂÂ alleles were identified: H1069Q (62.12%); M769Hfs*26 (2.27%); Val73GlufsX4 (1.52%) and D1267G, D765N, M645R, V1036I (0.76% for each); 31.06% of the alleles remained unidentified. Among the patients silent or not disease causing variants were found: R725R (2.27%); A1140V (12.12%); S406A (18.94%). Conclusions.1) The most prevalent mutation found in Latvian patients is H1069Q Ã¢ÂÂ in 62.12% cases; 2) Mutation Val73GlufsX4 presented in two patients is described among Sardinians and Bulgarians;3) The study should be continued to test all the ATP7B gene, since the selec tive screening has not identified all the mutations.",2015
23521,"Wolfram syndrome is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by dia betes mellitus and optic atrophy usually associated with diabetes insipidus, deafness, renal tract abnormalities or neuropsychiatric disorders, mainly associated with mutations in the WFS1 gene. Mutations in a second gene, CISD2, have also been described in patients with Wolfram syndrome type 2 characterized by diabetes mellitus and optic atrophy associated with peptic ulcer disease, bleeding tendency but without diabetes insipidus and psych iatric disorders. To date, only five families have been described and few data are available concerning both clinical phenotype and CISD2 function. Among our French Wolfram syndrome cohort of 98 patients with at least diabetes mellitus and optic atrophy, we identified 2 WFS1 mutations in 78 patients (80%). We sequenced the CISD2 gene in the 20 patients with only one WFS1 mutation (7/98 patients, 7%) or without any mutation (13/98 patients, 13%). We identified a new missense homozygous CISD2 mutation, c.215A>G (p. Asn72Ser), in a patient with a ÃÂ«classicalÃÂ» Wolfram presentati on without digestive or hematologic symptoms and who did not carry any WFS1 mutation. Segregation within the family, in silico analysis and absence in control individuals are in favor of the pathogenicity of this new variant. In conclusion, we show that CISD2 must be analyzed in patients presen ting with a ÃÂ«classicalÃÂ» Wolfram syndrome when WFS1 has been ruled out. Functional studies on primary fibroblasts, carrying the p.

We studied a case control cohort of 341 children mild/moderate persistent asthma and 245 controls. Blood samples were collected before treatment, and 4 6 weeks after treatment with ICS or LTRA. Atopic asthmatic patients with CT genotype presented significantly higher FENO (p,0.0303), total IgE (p,0.0146) and lower log PC20 (p,0.0403). Non atopic asthmatics with CT presented only significantly higher eosinophil count (p<0.001). After ICS treatment atopic asthmatics with CT genotype had less improvement of condition as measured by dFEV1/FVC (p,0.0440), while after LTRA treatment asthmatics with CT genotype had worsening condition measured by dFEV1/FVC (p,0.0286).

23525,"Introduction: A direct correlation between HIV infection and mutation in the chemokine receptor (CCR5) gene has been established. The 32 bp deleti on in the gene (CCR5 delta 32) alter function of the protein product, thereby altering chemokine binding/signaling. Homozygous carriers of the CCR5 delta 32 mutation are resistant to HIV 1 infection because the mutation pre vents functional expression of the CCR5 chemokine receptor normally used by the most of HIV 1 strains to enter CD4 T cells. However, resistance is not absolute due to alternative CXCR4 co receptor and HIV 1 isotropic switch. Materials and methods: In the present study, we have determined by PCR the allelic frequency of the CCR5 delta 32 mutation in 1385 Czech individu als aged 4 86. CCR5 delta 32 homozygotes were confirmed by sequencing. Results: 18,8% of studied individuals were heterozygous and 1,2% were ho mozygous for the mutation. Overall, the frequency for the CCR5 delta 32 al lele was 10,6%. Distribution of the mutation was unaffected by sex or age. Conclusion: The mutation is found principally in Europe and western Asia, with higher frequencies generally in the north. The frequency in the Czech population population is consistent with the origin of the mutation in nort hern Europe and natural gene flow into the central Europe. The CCR5 delta 32 mutation is a good example of an advantageous allele with a well charac terized geographic distribution, which may play important role in managing of HIV infection in the future.

23526,"Introduction: Celiac disease (CD) is a chronic, immune mediated gastroin testinal disorder that develops in genetically susceptible individuals due to an inappropriate immune response to ingested gluten. The only available treatment is a life long gluten free diet (GFD). Toll like receptor (TLR) pa thway is known to be crucial in the regulation of innate immunity, but also participates in the development of antigen specific adaptive immunity. The aim of this study was to characterize a possible deregulation in TLR pathway in CD. Materials and Methods: The expression of 28 genes related to TLR pathway was measured by RT PCR in biopsies from 16 patients with active CD, 16 patients in a GFD and 15 non celiac controls. The three groups where com pared. Results: Nine of the 28 genes were differentially expressed in active patients when compared to controls. CXCL11, IFNG, CXCL10, IL10 , IL6 and CCL5 were overexpressed, whereas TICAM1, TOLLIP and IRF3 were underexpressed. When treated patients and controls were compared, IRF5 was underex pressed, and TIRAP overexpressed. CXCL11, IFNG, CXCL10 and IL6 were differentially expressed between active and treated patients. Results were contextualized with the results of 23 additional genes obtained recently in our laboratory. Conclusions: Our results confirmed significant alterations in several genes. Patients treated with GFD showed a less altered pattern, although some genes remain altered suggesting a constitutive role in the pathogenesis of CD. Additionally, different degrees of alteration among the receptors, the pathway core and genes encoding costimulatory proteins, cytokines and interferons in active patients suggest a probable alteration downstream of the receptors.",2015

Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune disease with a strong genetic background characterized by chronic inflammation and au toantibody production. Genome wide association studies identified several loci associated with SLE pathogenesis. However, there are few studies that focus on the role of copy number variations (CNVs) in SLE etiology. The purpose of this study was to determine the role of CNVs in SLE patients. Lupus nephritis (LN) was a criterion of inclusion for this study. Blood cell lymphocytes from 23 SLE unrelated patients and 44 healthy subjects were submitted to the Genome Wide Human Cytoscan HD Array (AffymetrixÃÂ®) in order to screen for CNVs in genomic DNA. SLE patients and controls had no statistic difference in total CNV numbers, median size of CNVs, and the pro portion of the genome covered by CNVs. However, our results showed that SLE patients have common and rare CNVs in the loci that may contribute to the increased risk for SLE. We identified six common copy number variati on regions (CNVRs) as potential candidates involved with SLE in 8p11.22, 14q32.33, 22q13.33, Xp22.33 (2), and Xp26.2 loci (OR , 3.2Ã¢ÂÂ11.94; p , 0.0002Ã¢ÂÂ0.033).

The ge netic defect underlying some of the primary immune deficiencies including CVID remains unknown, and the current hypothesis is that it might be mul tigenic. We have applied the next generation sequencing technologies to the study of CVID. Material and Methods: The study has been performed in 36 patients with CVID diagnosed from a Spanish cohort including sporadic as well as familiar cases. CVID diagnosis was made using current international criteria. Pati ents were analyzed by exome sequencing and copy number variants (CNV) analysis. Results: We obtained an initial list of about fifty candidate genes for each patient. Candidate genetic variants were validated in the context of pedi grees, according to different genetic models for the disease. Functional clas sifications coupled with an in house algorithm for prioritizing mutations generated a shorter list of candidate genes for each patient. The integrated analysis of genetic data, together with the collected clinical and laboratory data, narrowed down the list of candidate causal genes and mutations. Func tional validation of candidate genes is being performed to test their role in the molecular origin of CVID. Conclusions: Exome sequencing is a powerful tool to detect the causal vari ants in CVID cases with Mendelian inheritance. Our results also suggest an oligogenic model for the disease in some patients.

23531,"Introduction: A male neonate presented with recurrent deep seated skin infections within the first four weeks of life. Full blood count identified se vere neutropenia. Separation of the umbilical cord was delayed beyond two weeks of life; physical examination of the neonate was otherwise normal with no dysmorphic features identified. Family pedigree was unremarkab le. Methods: Sanger sequencing of the ELANE gene was performed in the pro band, mother and father. Sequencing was approved by the NHS National Re search Ethics Service (12/SC/0044) with the purpose of accurate diagnosis prior to bone marrow transplant. Results: Sequencing identified a single heterozygous missense mutation in Exon 2, not present in either parent. The mutation (c.193G>T) was pre dicted to result in an amino acid change p.(Val65Phe). This would alter the property of the specific amino acid from an aliphatic Valine to an aromatic Phenylalanine. SIFT analysis predicted this variant to affect protein function with deleterious effects that would not be tolerated (calculated probability of 0.00). Polyphen 2 analysis predicted this variant to be highly damaging (calculated probability of 1.00). Conclusions: This is the first description of delayed separation of the um bilical cord associated with an ELANE c.193G>T mutation. Neonatal neu tropenia due to a variety of causes is associated with delayed separation of the cord. Although the c.193G>T mutation has previously been reported in cases of congenital neutropenia, more detailed clinical phenotyping of these rare cases will help reduce time to diagnosis in this life threatening and po tentially treatable disease.

However, in a substantial proportion of patients the disease associated alterations are still unknown. We studied a family with infantile recessive aHUS, in whom whole exome sequencing analysis with conventional variant filtering parameters did not reveal any obvious candidate mutation. The report of aHUS associated mu tations in DGKE , encoding diacylglycerol kinase epsilon, led us to re examine the non coding DGKE variants obtained from next generation sequencing, allowing identification of a novel intronic DGKE mutation (c.888+40A>G) that segregated with disease. Sequencing of cDNA from affected individu als revealed aberrant forms of DGKE mRNA predicted to cause profound abnormalities in the protein catalytic site. The same mutation was found in compound heterozygosity with a second nonsense DGKE mutation in all affected siblings of another unrelated family. Homozygous and compound heterozygous patients presented similar clinical features, including aHUS presentation in the first year of life, multiple relapsing episodes and prote inuria, which are prototypical of DGKE associated aHUS. This is the first report of a mutation located beyond the exon intron bounda ries in aHUS. Intronic mutations such as these are underreported since con ventional filtering parameters used to process next generation sequencing data routinely exclude these regions from downstream analyses in both re search and clinical settings.

To date, over 220 genes responsible for these diseases have been recognized, and this list is rapidly growing. The diagnosis of PIDs based on symptoms is often difficult, as they overlap between disorders and can also vary considerably between individuals with mutations in the same gene. To elucidate the genetic causes for disease, we are performing clinical whole exome sequencing on Finnish PID patients. Our cohort currently consists of roughly 150 index cases, about 100 of which have been sequenced by now. We have detected both previously identified and novel disease variants in known PID genes, as well as identified putative disease variants in genes that have not been previously associated with such diseases. For example, several variants in the TNFRSF13B gene have been previously described as predisposing to CVID, and interrogation of the exome sequence data of Finnish population cohorts (Sequencing Initiative Suomi) shows that some of these variants are enriched in Finland. This could partially explain why CVIDs seem to be overrepresented in Finland compared to the rest of Eu rope. Consistently with this, we have identified previously reported disease variants in TNFRSF13B in three patients with CVID. However, several of the sequenced CVID patients do not carry mutations in this or any other pre viously reported PID gene, and thus warrant further investigation.",2015

Despite several the rapeutic approaches, including high dose chemotherapy, stem cell transplan tation and the usage of novel agents such as bortezomib, MM still remains an incurable disease. Extensive genomic instability associated with molecular heterogeneity is a major hallmark of MM cells. Unfaithful DNA repair has been implicated to promote the genomic instability and cancer cell survival. Werner Seyndrome (WRN) helicase is a member of RecQ helicase family and contributes to DNA replication, recombination and repair. The supression of WRN expression in cancer cells by siRNA or its inhibitor led to an increased succebility to agents generating DNA damage and cell death by stimulating apoptosis. Therefore, the inhibition of WRN expression might be a potential target for increasing the susceptibility of MM cells against chemotherapeu tic drugs. In this study, we show the increased expression of WRN in both newly diagnosed and relapsed CD138+ myeloma plasma cells compared to both normal subjects and their CD138 non tumorigenic cells. Furthermore, by using NSC19630 a specific WRN helicase inhibitor, we further show a de creased proliferation and an increased apoptosis in MM cells. These results show that WRN is involved in MM proliferation and its inhibition may serve to enhance the efficacy of chemotherapy.

The raw data from HiSeq1500 were analysed using an in house pipeline and from the resulting vcf files the common variants (<1%) and variants predicted as tolerated by both Po lyPhen and SIFT were discarded. Genes related to PID or aplastic anemia were chosen from the remaining variants. This approach identified under lying mutations in 5/10 cases: interleukin 7 receptor in infant with severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID); perforin in infant who died due to fa milial hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis; SLX4 and ASXL1 in two child ren with refractory cytopenia, and TACI in patient with common variable immunodeficiency (CVID). In another infant with SCID a mutation causing cartilage hair hypoplasia was missed by WES, because the RMRP gene was not covered in the sequencing library. The diagnosis was done by clinical ge neticist only after stem cell transplant, which was performed at 2.5 months of age. In three patients (2x CVID, 1x neutropenia) possible disease causing mutations were suggested but not yet verified.

Introduction: Primary immune deficiency disorders (PIDs) are a group of diseases that the genetic basis of many has been identified. Although the tra ditionally diagnostics are often sufficient to confirm the suspicion of certain PIDs, molecular tests are required to permit a conclusive diagnosis. Genetic counseling together with clinical evaluation plays a critical role in the ap propriate use of these tests, which have great potential to improve treat ment outcomes. In this review by our experiences, we outline the algorithm for PIDs and the clinical utility of next generation sequencing (NGS).Materials and Methods: We have designed a diagnostic algorithm and custo mized test panels via flow cytometry and then next generation sequencing by MiSeqSystem (Illumina). In silico analysis for novel mutations was car ried out using SIFT , Polyphen2 and MutationTaster. Results: The causative mutation was identified in only 18 out of 38 patients with suspected PIDs and 9 out of 12 patients with chronic granulomatous disease (CGD). More than that, the identified mutations in 10 of 18 were no vel mutations. Many of undiagnosed suspected patients (n,20 for PID, n,3 for CGD) whom immunophenotype does not help to identify them may have had as yet uncharacterized mutations in other genes. Conclusion: In summary, the availability of molecular genetic testing has profound implications for immunologists and patients. The benefits of ge netic testing are for diagnosis including the pre symptomatic and screening, prevention including the prenatal and pre implantation genetic diagnosis, treatment even including the gene therapy modalities, prognosis and re search. Moreover, the application of NGS has broadened the understanding PIDs and critical in modern disease classification.",2015

Peptidyl citrulline is an interesting molecule in RA because it is a target antigen for anti citrullinated peptide antibodies, and only PADs (translated proteins from PADI genes) can provide peptidyl ci trulline via the modification of protein substrates. The aim of this study was to evaluate the importance of the PADI4 gene in the progression of RA. Methods We generated Padi4 knockout (Padi4Ã¢ÂÂ/Ã¢ÂÂ) DBA1J mice. The Padi4Ã¢ÂÂ/Ã¢ÂÂ DBA1J and wild type mice were immunized with bovine type II collagen (CII) to develop collagen induced arthritis (CIA). The expression of various in flammatory cytokines and Padi genes in immune cells was detected by the real time TaqMan assay. Cytokine concentrations in sera were measured by enzyme linked immunosorbent assays. Localization of the PAD4 and PAD2 proteins was indicated by immunohistochemistry. ResultsWe demonstrated that the clinical disease score was significantly decreased in the Padi4Ã¢ÂÂ/Ã¢ÂÂ mice and Padi4 expression was induced by CII immunizati on. In the Padi4Ã¢ÂÂ/Ã¢ÂÂ mice, serum anti type II collagen (CII) immunoglobulin M (IgM), IgG, and inflammatory cytokine levels were significantly decreased compared with those in the wild type mice. Padi2 expression was induced in the immune cells of the Padi4Ã¢ÂÂ/Ã¢ÂÂ mice as a compensation for the defect in Padi4.ConclusionPadi4 affected disease severity in the CIA mice and was involved in the en hancement of the collagen initiated inflammatory responses.",2015
23543,"Stevens Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) are acute inflammatory vesiculobullous reactions of the skin and mucous mem branes, and these reactions are reported to be caused by inciting drugs, viral infections, or malignant tumor. Although the occurance of SJS/TEN is rare at about 1 6 cases per million, mortality rates are higher than other drug rush (SJS: 3%, TEN: 27%). In addition, Quality of life (QOL) of the most survivors is often low, as severe ocular surface complications are often developed as the aftereffect. Over 1,000 drugs have been reported as the so called Ã¢ÂÂcausal medicineÃ¢ÂÂ of SJS/TEN, and susceptibility to SJS/TEN caused by some of them the medici nes have been reported to be associated with HLA genes. As examples, HLA A*31:01 and HLA B*15:02 have been reported to be associated with carb amazepine induced severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCARs). Besides, HLA B*58:01 have been reported as susceptible allele of Allopurinol related SJS/TEN. Recently, HLA A and IKZF1 have been reported to be susceptib le for Cold Medicine Related Stevens Johnson Syndrome/Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis (CM SJS/TEN) in Asian populations by genome wide association study (GWAS). However, remaining genetic susceptibility of CM SJS/TEN in cluding rare variants and structural variants remains to be discovered. To identify the functional variants for CM SJS/TEN with severe mucosal in volvement, whole exome sequencing was performed in about 121 Japanese CM SJS/TEN patients with severe mucosal involvement using next generati on sequencer (NGS) ion Proton (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Whole exome sequencing data were then analyzed using CLC Genomics Workbench (CLC bio) software. Here we will show the provisional results of Whole exome sequencing for CM SJS/TEN. This study illustrates novel diagnostic and therapeutic me thods for CM SJS/TEN.",2015
23544,"Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune disorder with hete rogeneous clinical manifestations. The etiology of SLE is complex, involving interplay between genetic, environmental and hormonal factors. Although many loci have been identified, only a small proportion of heritability of SLE is explained, indicating a demand for different approaches for discovery of disease associated genes. The aim of this study was to identify novel rare genetic variants relevant for SLE. We performed targeted re sequencing of 219 genes selected on the basis of their role in immune responses, general autoimmunity, and known associations with human SLE, or SLE related di sease in dogs. The study cohort included 144 Swedish SLE patients and 17 matching controls. The Nimblegen capture array was used for target regions enrichment, which were sequenced on Illumina HiSeq2000. Variants were filtered to be present only in cases, but not in controls or 1000 genomes or dbSNP . For further functional validation we chose three variants located in the genes MEF2D, TCRA and HAPLN3 and overlapping with DNase I hyper sensitivity sites, ENCODE histone marks and ChIP Seq peaks. The regulatory potential of the novel variants was investigated with EMSA and luciferase reporter assay, and indicated that two variants may influence gene expres sion. Additional genotyping of 742 Swedish controls demonstrated a higher frequency of the variants in SLE patients. A correlation between particular disease manifestations and the novel variants was also observed. Our study successfully combines the detection of novel rare variants, with functional and clinical data to generate hypothesis about specific disease mechanis ms.",2015
23545,"[Objectives] GravesÃ¢ÂÂ disease (GD) risk is strongly associated with genetic variations within the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) region. Ho wever, its fine genetic architecture has not been elucidated.[Methods] To fine map GD risk alleles within the MHC region in Japanese, we newly constructed a population specific HLA reference panel consisting of the healthy subjects of Japanese ancestry (n , 908). We conducted trans ethnic comparisons of linkage disequilibrium (LD) and haplotype structures of the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) variants by introducing a novel fra mework that utilizes an entropy based LD measurement and a visualization tool capturing high dimensional variables. Finally, we applied our HLA im putation method to the large scale Japanese GD genome wide association study (GWAS) data (n > 9,000).[Results] The Japanese population demonstrated stronger LD between the HLA genes compared to European or other east Asian populations, highligh ted by one population specific common long range HLA haplotype spanning through the entire MHC region and HLA genes (frequency > 0.08). Applicati on of the HLA imputation method to the Japanese GD GWAS data identified that amino acid polymorphisms of the multiple class I and class II HLA genes independently contribute to GD risk (HLA DPÃÂ²1 amino acid positions 35 and 9, HLA A amino acid position 9, HLA B amino acid positions 45 and 67, and HLA DRÃÂ²1 amino acid position 74; P < 6.0ÃÂ10^ 7), with the strongest impact at HLA DPB1 (P < 1.0ÃÂ10^ 40).[Conclusion] Our study illustrates the value of the population specific HLA reference panel for HLA imputation, with successful fine mapping of the MHC region risk of GD to multiple HLA amino acid polymorphisms.

23546,"16p13.11 microdeletion is a recently described syndrome characterized by developmental delay, microcephaly, epilepsy, dysmorphic features and be havioral problems. The deleted region contains more than 10 genes inclu ding NTAN1 and NDE1. These genes may be relevant to the neuro cognitive phenotype of this syndrome. Variable phenotypic presentation has been de scribed with partial penetrance. Most cases are de novo. Prevalence in the normal population is 4:10,000 . However 16p13.11 deletions is detected in 60:10,000 patients with a diverse spectrum of epilepsy syndromes. Mowat Wilson syndrome (MWS) is a rare condition (1:60,000), characteri zed by a distinctive phenotype, mild to severe develeopmental delay, seizu res, short stature, microcephaly, Hirschsprung disease or constipation, ge nitourinary defects, heart defect, and eye anomalies. Almost all cases are associated with ZEB2 mutations, located on chromosome 2q22.3. We describe a 12y old boy with intellectual disability, behavioral problems, history of infantile spasms since the age of 3m, constipation, hypospadias, dysmorphic features and microcephaly. Parents are healthy and unrelated. He has a non identical twin brother who has ADD but is otherwise healthy and has normal intelligence. MWS has been considered in this boy. However, routine workup included CMA testing diagnosed a 16p13.11 microdeletion. Clinical reevaluation of the patient in view of the CMA results revealed the overlapping between both syndromes. We would like to suggest that 16p13.11 microdeletion may be a phenocopy of MWS. CMA in our report showed once again its importance in resolving cases with intellectual disability and suggested the existence of gene(s) in the deleted interval that may be responsible for a phenocopy of MWS.",2015
23547,"19p13.2 microdeletion is a rare genomic disorder. To date, less than ten cases was described so far in the literature. This chromosomal syndrome manifests in developmental delay/intellectual impairment, postnatal over growth, macrocephaly, craniofacial dysmorphy, slender habitus, advanced bone age, and scoliosis. Hypotonia, unusual behavior with autistic traits, ophthalmologic, gastrointestinal, and hand/foot abnormalities are also fre quent. Very similar phenotype is observed in the Sotos syndrome 2 (MIM #614753) that is caused by heterozygous mutations/deletions of the NFIX gene located on chromosome 19p13.2.Here, we report on the case of a 7 year old girl referred to genetic counse ling because of psychomotor retardation, speech delay and dysmorphic fea tures (macrocephaly, long/narrow and triangular face, high forehead, fron tal bossing, downslanting palpebral fissures, dysplastic low set ears, small nose, flat philtrum, micrognathia). At the examination, behavioral problems (anxiety, tantrums, autoaggression), seizures, and poor coordination were noted. Skeletal anomalies (advanced bone age, joint laxity, slender hands with long fingers, abnormal setting of the lower limbs), strabismus, hypero pia as well as constipations and abdominal pain were also diagnosed. Whole genome oligonucleotide microarray analysis revealed a de novo 158.18 kb (the smallest so far) deletion of 19p13.2 region (chr19:13,020,206 13,178,390; hg19) encompassing seven genes; three of them (NFIX, DAND5 and CALR) could be the candidate genes for the genotype phenotype rela tionship. This study contributes additional information for the newly identified 19p13.2 microdeletion syndrome and clarifies the clinical roles of genes in the involved region. Our results also confirm that haploinsufficiency of NFIX leads to Sotos like phenotype. This study was supported by the MNiSW Grant No. 0193/IP1/2013/72.",2015
23548,"1p36 deletion syndrome is one the most common subtelomeric deletion syndromes seen in humans. Uniform features of the syndrome include in tellectual disability, characteristic dysmorphic facial features, cardiac and craniofacial anomalies. This syndrome has been well described in paedia tric patients. However, in adult patients data on the natural history is still limited. We describe five patients with a microdeletion 1p36, that were diagnosed during adulthood, to illustrate the variability of the clinical course. The most severe case was a male patient that was diagnosed with 1p36 deletion syn drome at the age of 18 years. He had a profound intellectual disability, seizu res, challenging behaviour and bilateral congenital cataract. A few weeks after diagnosis he developed stroke caused by a newly discovered dilated cardiomyopathy, which is a common feature of 1p36 deletion syndrome. Un fortunately, 6 months later he died of heart failure that was exacerbated by a respiratory infection. This case illustrates the importance of early genetic diagnosis and syndrome specific follow up in adult patients, to provide bet ter care and early intervention in this challenging group of patients.",2015
23549,"The 2p15 p16.1 microdeletion syndrome is a rare disorder characterized by developmental delay, intellectual disability, growth retardation, microce phaly, abnormal muscle tone, optic nerve dysplasia and a distinctive pattern of craniofacial features. Reported deletionsÃ¢ÂÂ sizes range from 5.7 Mb, contai ning numerous genes, to 0.2 Mb, including a single gene, BCL11A. We report a 4 year old girl with delayed motor and language development, microcephaly, asymmetry in carpal bone maturation, facial hypotonia and peculiar craniofacial features. Array CGH revealed a de novo deletion of 350 Kb in the locus 2p16.1, which only included a microRNA MIR4432 and part of the BCL11A gene, and a duplication of 123 Kb in 22q13.1, inherited from the probandÃ¢ÂÂs healthy mother. To our knowledge, this is the second smallest deletion associated with the 2p15 p16.1 microdeletion syndrome reported to date. Compared to the individual with the 0.2 Mb deletion, who presen ted with mild intellectual disability, abnormal muscle tone and expressive language delay, our proband also shows microcephaly and facial features evocative of the condition, while growth retardation and other features de scribed in previous cases are absent. In conclusion, the present case provides further evidence on the correlation of heterozygous 2p15 p16.1 deletions with specific clinical features. Fur thermore, the small size of the current deletion might help to clarify the role of single genes in this complex phenotype.",2015
23550,"Deletions of the terminal region of the short arm of chromosome 2 have been reported in the literature in less than 20 patients. These patients share common clinical features including early onset obesity, intellectual disabili ty and behavioral troubles or autism. A minimal critical region of 1.97 Mb has been estimated, encompassing seven genes (SH3HYL1 , ACP1, TMEM18 , SNTG2, TPO, PXDN, and MYT1L). Many recent studies pointed out MYT1L gene as the main candidate for ID and obesity. We present three new pa tients carrying 2p25 deletions: an autist female child with developmental delay and her depressive father, and a third unrelated patient who has psy chomotor retardation and behavioral troubles. Moreover, our patients do not have an overweight phenotype, highlighting indeed the role of MYT1L in obesity, as none of the deletions encompasses MYT1L. The only common disrupted gene is SNTG2, thus redefining the smallest region of overlap for autism. SNTG2 is expressed in brain. Its product interacts with neuroligins NLGN3, NLGN4X, and NLGN4Y, which are autism related isoforms. Finally, the parental origin of the deletions seems to be of interest, as all inherited deletions described today appear to be inherited from the paternal side. We will discuss the possible imprinting of the 2p25 region and its role in au tism. ABSTRACTS POSTERS ESHG 2015 | GLASGOW, SCOTLAND, UK | WWW. ESHG. ORG 152Back to inde x",2015
23551,"We present a novel molecular cause of Angelman syndrome (AS) in a female patient with microcephaly, dysmorphism, global developmental and speech delay and intellectual disability. Her phenotype resembles a milder form of AS with no seizures and 20 words of speech at the age of 5 years. EEG inve stigation of the patient showed typical AS findings. Suspecting a clinical diagnosis of AS, molecular analysis was undertaken using methylation specific PCR (MS PCR) and revealed normal methylation at the SNRPN DMR ruling out UPD, deletion or an imprinting defect asso ciated with the majority of AS. Sequencing of the coding exons of UBE3A revealed no pathogenic mutations. Microarray CGH identified a maternally inherited 30kb deletion at 15q11.2 involving exon 1 of UBE3A. This deletion was de novo in the patientÃ¢ÂÂs mother and linkage analysis revealed the origin of the deletion in the grand paternal allele, explaining the normal pheno type in the patientÃ¢ÂÂs mother due to genomic imprinting. Although intragenic deletions of the maternal copy of UBE3A are a recog nised cause of AS, to date there have been no reported deletions of exon 1. Exon 1 is non protein coding and therefore not routinely sequenced. The intragenic deletion in our patient also includes the main promoter of UBE3A adjacent to exon 1 and the milder phenotype in our patient may be explai ned by secondary promoters downstream producing transcripts. We present the detailed clinical phenotype of our patient, discuss the initial difficulties of interpreting the clinical significance of this novel finding and present the subsequent RNA/expression analysis.",2015
23552,"The CASK gene maps to Xp11.4 and is related to synaptic functions. Aberra tions of this gene are associated with microcephaly with pontine and cere bellar hypoplasia (MICPIH), developmental delay, and nystagmus in females. We report a male patient with mosaicism of CASK mutation. He was born to nonconsanguineous parents at 39 weeks. The parents were healthy and their family history was unremarkable. His birth weight was 2334g ( 1.4SD), length 45cm ( 1.5SD), and the head circumference 30.0cm ( 2.2SD). He had ventricular septal defect, and had mitral valve regurgi tation at 5 months old. He also had nystagmus. At 3 years and 6 months old, his weight was 9075g ( 3.2SD), length 82.0cm ( 4.0SD), head circumfe rence 39.0cm ( 7.2SD). He had severe intellectual disability. At 4 years old, he doesnÃ¢ÂÂt speak, nor does he keep sitting position. Chromosome studies showed a normal 46,XY karyotype. We performed cytogenetic microarray, which revealed no significant copy number variation. Next we performed targeted high throughput sequencing of 4813 genes in which mutations had been described in patients with Mendelian genetic disorders. We confirmed a de novo mosaic mutation (c.725G>A:p. W242X) of CASK. The ratio of muta tion was 93% in peripheral blood lymphocytes. CASK knockdown mice are smaller than wild type mice but viable, whereas CASK knockout mice die at first day of their lives. For male patients, trun cating mutation in CASK has been regarded as lethal. Next generation se quencing confirmed a mosaicism masked by a high proportion of mutant cells. These results suggest that mosaicism seemed crucial for male patientsÃ¢ÂÂ survival.",2015
23553,"Hemizygous deletion of the CHL1 gene at 3p26.3 is a very rare finding, pre viously reported in 4 families. Cognitive impairment, in particular language difficulties, is a consistent phenotypic feature. However, due to the small number of cases reported to date, the clinical significance of deletions in cluding CHL1 remains uncertain. Homozygous deletions of the region have never been reported. Here we describe an eight year old boy, born to consanguinous parents, who has marked learning difficulties, absence of speech, stiffness in his lower legs and persistent drooling. Array CGH studies carried out using the Blue Gnome CytoChip Oligo ISCA 8x60k (v2.0) array showed a deletion of the sequences detected by the oligonucleotide probes located from 93,979bp to 290,767bp. This equates to a 197kb interstitial deletion of the short arm of chromosome 3 at p26.3. This resulted in a partial deletion of the CHL1 gene. Real time quantitative PCR (qPCR) studies with targets within introns 1 and 2 of the CHL1 gene, confirmed this deletion and showed that it was homozygous. Further qPCR studies in the parents of this proband showed they both had a hemizygous deletion of this region. The proband has there fore inherited one abnormal chromosome 3 from each parent who are both clinically unaffected. This is the first case reported of a patient presenting with an abnormal phenotype with a homozygous deletion including part of the CHL1 gene at 3p26.3.",2015
23554,"Introduction:Xp22.31 submicroscopic duplication has been reported as either a possible cause of intellectual disability (ID) and/or developmental delay or as a be nign variant. Methods:Comparative genomic hybridization array (aCGH) (Agilent 60K) was used to analyse 511 patients affected by ID and/or dysmorphic features/congenital defects. Results:We detected potentially pathogenic copy number variants (CNV) in 94 out of 511 patients analysed (18%). A submicroscopic duplication in the Xp22.31 region was identified in 8 patients (5Ã¢ÂÂ:3Ã¢ÂÂ) ranging in size from 257 Kb to 1.7 Mb. In all individuals studied (four out of eight) the Xp22.31 duplication was inherited from the mother. The HDHD1, STS, VCX and PNPLA4 genes are included in four cases with a 1.6Mb duplication, who show autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and no dysmorphic features. Interestingly, two cases with a size below 580Kb, where only HDHD1 and STS genes are duplicated, show a more severe phenotype with multiple malformations. The largest duplica tion detected (from VCX3A to VCX2) is associated with language delay. The patient also carries a deletion at 6p23 of 1.3 Mb as a result of an unbalanced t(6;9). Finally, a duplication of 565Kb involving VCX and PNPLA4 was detec ted in a boy with psychomotor delay. Conclusion:We have detected an association of the Xp22.31 duplication with ID and ASD in both genders. According to the literature, there is a high variability in the Xp22.31 duplication associated phenotype, which may be due to incomplete penetrance, the different genes involved, a position effect and X inactivation. Increased CNV on the X chromosome can contribute to deregulation of nor mal cognitive development.",2015

23556,"mRNA decay is an essential and active process that allows cells to conti nuously adapt gene expression to internal and environmental cues. There are two mRNA degradation pathways: 3Ã¢ÂÂ to 5Ã¢ÂÂ and 5Ã¢ÂÂ to 3Ã¢ÂÂ. The DCPS protein is the scavenger mRNA decapping enzyme which functions in the last step of the 3ÃÂ´ end mRNA decay pathway. We have identified a DCPS pathogenic mutation in a large family with three affected individuals presenting with a novel recessive syndrome consisting of craniofacial anomalies, intellec tual disability and neuromuscular defects. Using patientÃ¢ÂÂs primary cells, we show that this homozygous splice mutation results in a DCPS loss of function allele. Diagnostic biochemical analyses using various m7G cap de rivatives as substrates reveal no DCPS enzymatic activity in patientÃ¢ÂÂs cells.

Dysmorphic aspect of the face and the skin inclu des microcephaly, frontal bossing, large dysplastic ears, thin lips, cutis laxa, wrinkled atrophic skin and reduced subcutaneous fat. To our knowledge, only two cases of De Barsy syndrome associated with blood vessels tortuo sity have been described. De Barsy syndrome is genetically heterogeneous since 2 genes have been identified: ALDH18A1 encoding delta1 pyrroline 5 carboxylate synthase (P5CS) and the gene encoding pyrroline 5 carboxylate reductase 1(PYCR1). Both genes are involved in proline biosynthesis pathway but pathological mechanisms leading to the syndrome are still misunderstood. Some pati ents carrying homozygote ALDH18A1 mutations have low level of proline, arginine, citrulline and ornithine. We report the case of a boy displaying all the features of De Barsy syn drome including specific profile of plasmatic amino acid chromatography. He had also arterial tortuosity (which has been already reported twice in ALDH18A1 mutated patients) and his CT scan showed calcifications which has never been described yet in De Barsy syndrome. This patient carried compound heterozygote ALDH18A1 mutations. According to the role of P5CS in the proline biosynthesis and as it was al ready done for another patient of the literature, supplementation with ar ginine was tried during one year but no improvement was observed on the psychomotor development. This failure suggest that disturbance of proline biosynthesis in P5CS deficiency would not be responsible of the neurologi cal phenotype.",2015
23558,"Objective: The current standard of care for diagnosis of severe intellectu al disability (ID) and epileptic encephalopathy (EE) results in a diagnostic yield of ~50%. Affected individuals nonetheless undergo multiple clinical evaluations and low yield laboratory tests often referred to as a Ã¢ÂÂdiagnostic odysseyÃ¢ÂÂ. This study was aimed at assessing the utility of clinical whole exo me sequencing (WES) in individuals with undiagnosed and severe forms of ID and EE, and the feasibility of its implementation in routine practice by a small regional genetic center. Methods: We performed WES in a cohort of 43 unrelated individuals with severe forms of ID and/or EE. All individuals had undergone multiple cli nical evaluations and diagnostic tests over the years, with no definitive dia gnosis. Sequencing data analysis and interpretation were carried out at the Dijon University Hospital Molecular Genetics Laboratory. Results: The molecular diagnosis rate of WES reached 32,5% (14 of 43 in dividuals), with pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants associated with six autosomal dominant (ARID1B, CTNNB1, DYRK1A, SHANK3, NAA10 and TBR1), five autosomal recessive (ADCK3, GFER, SCN10A, TAF2 and SLC13A5 in two families) and two X linked (CUL4B, and SLC16A2) conditions. Genetic diagnosis had implications for a personalised clinical management in four families, including prenatal diagnosis test in one family. Interpretation: Our data emphasize the clinical utility and feasibility of WES in individuals with undiagnosed forms of ID and EE, highlight the necessity of close collaborations between ordering physicians, molecular geneticists, bioinformaticians and researchers for enhanced data interpretation, and support the use of WES as a first line test for individuals with severe neuro developmental disorders.",2015

It is known to be expressed in adult human brain with the highest level of expression in the cerebellum. It is closely linked with brain growth in a gene dosage dependent manner. DYRK1A haploinsufficiency induces a reduced brain size in mice whereas a DYRK1A gain of function model would exhibit increased brain volume. DYRK1A has been implicated in tau phos phorylation and is becoming an attractive drug target since its overexpres sion may induce Down Syndrome like neurobiological alterations.

23560,"JohnÃ¢ÂÂs College, University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom. Dyscalculia (or mathematical ability) is a condition where mathematical ability is severely impaired. Twin studies suggest that it is partly caused by a genetic component, which is yet to be understood at the molecular level. Re cently, a coding variant (rs133885) in the Myosin 18B gene was shown to be associated with mathematical abilities with a specific effect among children with dyslexia. This association represents one of the most significant genetic associations reported to date for mathematical abilities. However, this asso ciation has not been replicated before. We conducted a replication analysis in different cohorts characterised with maths related measures. The study was conducted primarily using the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) (N,3819), which was adequately powered for this ana lysis. We tested additional cohorts including the York Cohort (N,291), the Specific Language Impairment Consortium (SLIC) (N,367) and the Raine Cohort (N,667). Cohorts were stratified for a definition of dyslexia where possible. We did not observe any associations between rs133885 in Myosin 18B and mathematical abilities among individuals with dyslexia or in the general population. Our results then suggest that the Myosin 18B variant is unlikely to be a main factor contributing to mathematical abilities. SP is a Royal Society University Research Fellow.

Results:Analysis of microarray data revealed highly significant differences between groups of younger patients with severe cognitive disability and of older patients without dementia with regard to expression of MTRNR2L12 gene, which is known to be associated with AlzheimerÃ¢ÂÂs disease. Subsequent com parison of another subgroup of younger patients with documented cogni tive deterioration and the above group of older patients without dementia gave very similar results. Conclusion:The findings of the study suggest a protective role of MTRNR2L12 in de velopment of early AlzheimerÃ¢ÂÂs disease like dementia in adults with Down syndrome. Further studies should be performed to evaluate potential use fulness of this marker in patients with AlzheimerÃ¢ÂÂs disease.

23562,"Early onset epileptic encephalopathies (EOEEs) represent a heterogeneous group of neurological disorders, often characterized by therapy resistant seizures, electroencephalographic abnormalities as well as motor and co gnitive deficits or decline. Despite the poor prognosis, early diagnosis in af fected children may contribute to improve disease management and enables genetic counseling. Due to excessive heterogeneity in EOEEs, clarification of the etiology is difficult. We therefore studied the usefulness of comprehen sive genetic and metabolomic testing in 63 consecutive patients with EOEE followed in the pediatric neurology division. We performed high resolution chromosomal microarray analysis (CMA) using the Affymetrix Cytoscan HD array and high coverage (average more than 290fold) whole exome trio se quencing (WES) using the Illumina HiSeq 2500 platform. 6.3% of patients showed clearly pathogenic CNVs. In 5 (26.3%) out of 19 trios analyzed so far by WES, deleterious mutations in disease causing genes were identified; 2 (40%) of them represent autosomal dominant mutations, 2 (40%) were inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern and 1 (20%) was an X linked condition. Furthermore, in another 5 (26.3%) trios we found deleterious variants in genes previously reported in association with epilepsy and/or ID, but not described in EOEEs. Metabolome analysis in plasma was so far completed in 36 patients and revealed abnormal profiles in 5 patients. In one case a novel plasma biomarker could be identified and matched with the mutated gene supporting the functional relevance of the respective mutati on. Therefore, CMA and WES is a powerful diagnostic tool in EOES revealing a diagnosis in at least 33% of patients.",2015

We describe the successful implementation of a gene panel into diagnostic service, our experience so far and the results from 400 patients. Two different custom enrichments (SureSelect, Agilent and TSCA, Illumina) were used to target 45 genes associated with EIEE and developmental delay followed by sequencing on the Illumina MiSeq. The custom SureSelect panel performed significantly better than TSCA and is now our chosen platform for this panel which has now been expanded to 66 genes. Mutations in 21 different genes were identified in 67 patients giving a detec tion rate of 17%. The most frequently mutated genes were SCN2A (11 pati ents), CDKL5 and KCNQ2 (6 patients each). We found mutations in a number of genes in patients with electroclinical phenotypes not typical for the gene. Given genetic heterogeneity and phenotypic pleiotropy in EIEE, the panel is proving a useful and popular diagnostic tool for Neurologists and Clini cal Geneticists, thereby allowing better disease prognostication and genetic counselling for these families, as well as reducing the number and cost of conventional diagnostic tests.",2015
23564,"Dr Stoyan KirkovichÃ¢ÂÂ, Stara Zagora, Bulgaria, 6Neurogenetics Group, VIB Department of Molecular Genetics, University of Antwerp, Antwerp, Belgium. Copy number variations (CNVs) often result from non allelic homologous recombination (NAHR) during meiosis. They are frequent cause of intellec tual disability (ID) and epilepsy. In the present study we performed compa rative genomic hybridization (aCGH) using Agilent Microarray Kit, 4x180K in a sample of 71 Bulgarian patients with epilepsy and ID. In 11 patients recurrent microaberrations within 17q12 region were found, approximately 1 Mb distal from the breakpoints of the classical 17q12 de letion/duplication syndromes. Four of them carried microduplications and seven microdeletions. All of the examined patients show overlapping phe notype, involving generalized tonic clonic, myoclonic and absence seizures, ID, behavior problems, speech impairment. Some additional features are ataxia, hypotonia, facial dysmorphisms and memory problems. All of the CNVs vary in size between 95 and 359 Kb, but the minimum shared region includes CACNB1 gene, encoding beta subunit of voltage dependent Ca2+ channel. This gene is suggested as a strong candidate, responsible for epi lepsy in mice. Moreover, mutations of a paralog of CACNB1 CACNB4 are as sociated with some types of epileptic conditions. Three of the deletions en compass part of FBXL20 gene, implicated in brain functions by modulating neuronal synaptic plasticity. This gene is ubiquitously expressed in brain and loss of function mutations in mice cause histopathological and behavior abnormalities. Therefore, disruptions of FBXL20 gene might contribute to the complex epileptic phenotype seen in our patients. Further investigations are needed to elucidate the effect of the microaberrations and to clarify the phenotype genotype correlations. The study was supported by DTK02/67/2009, funded by NSF.",2015
23565,"BACKGROUNDFor the identification of molecular defects in patients with suspected gene tic disorders, whole exome sequencing (WES) has now entered in medical practice as a diagnostic approach and trios analysis as the most effective strategy to identify de novo causal variants. METHODSWe performed exome sequencing using the Ion AmpliSeq TM Exome technolo gy (Life Technologies) with Ion ProtonTM. Sequencing reads were analysed using Torrent Suite software. Trio annotated variants using ION Reporter were prioritized with an in house analytical pipeline to identify causative genetic variants. RESULTSWe present data on the first 50 probands for whom referring physicians or dered whole exome sequencing trio analysis. Patients were mainly children with neurologic disorders including developmental and/or speech delay, autism, and intellectual disability. We identified 5 pathogenic and 14 pro bably pathogenic mutated alleles that were highly likely to be causative in 18 of the 50 patients, achieving a 36% molecular diagnostic rate. Among the 18 patients, 1 had X linked dominant, 2 X linked recessive, 1 autosomal recessive, and 14 autosomal dominant diseases. The X linked dominant va riant and all of the autosomal dominant mutant alleles occurred Ã¢ÂÂde novoÃ¢ÂÂ . Additionally, variants of uncertain significance were identified in 21 pati ents. These could be novel genes, however further studies are needed to define its role as causative events. CONCLUSIONSWe have identified the underlying genetic defect in 36% of consecutive patients referred for evaluation of a possible genetic condition using WES. These data allow us to conclude that trio analysis is a powerful and effective diagnostic method for mendelian disorders.",2015
23566,"Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is caused by an expansion of a CGG repeat in the 5Ã¢ÂÂUTR region of the FMR1 gene to over 200 triplets. In typical FXS cases, silencing of the FMR1 gene due to methylation of its promoter precludes protein expression. Loss of the FMR1 protein leads to the physical, neuro cognitive and behavioural FXS features. Somatic mosaics in the FMR1 locus are uncommon and can be due either to the presence of alleles with various CGG repeat sizes or epigenetic differences in the extent of methylation. Mo saicism for more than two alleles is a particularly rare finding, although it has been previously described. These phenomena hamper prediction of the disease prognosis. Herein, we report two independent male cases with a phenotype compa tible with mosaic FXS who show atypical mosaic patterns for CGG repeat number, one a mosaic for a full mutation/normal allele and the other for a full mutation/premutation/normal allele. Their mothers were carriers of the premutation. Southern blot analysis, still considered the gold standard for molecular diagnosis of FXS, enabled the characterization of different size mosaics in both cases. The mechanisms of trinucleotide repeat instability in the FMR1 locus are still not fully understood, although several have been proposed. Likewise, it is still not clear when the repeat expansion occurs (pre zygotic vs. post zygotic models). We discuss the possible mechanisms of repeat instability in our cases and present arguments in favour and against both repeat expan sion models. Implications for clinical management, molecular diagnosis and genetic counselling are discussed.",2015
23567,"Introduction: CGG triplet repeat expansions in the 5Ã¢ÂÂ untranslated region of the X linked Fragile X Mental Retardation 1 (FMR1) gene are associated with three FMR1 related conditions, including fragile X associated tremor/ataxia syndrome, fragile X associated primary ovarian insufficiency and fragile X syndrome. The high cost factor and/or the labor intensive nature of the cur rently available molecular diagnostic approaches prohibit their application as a first tier screening test for FMR1 mutation in large scale population based screening programs. We tested the utility of a simplified first line screening strategy that relies on melt peak temperature (T m) analysis of direct triplet primed PCR amplicons (dTP PCR MCA). Correlation between T m and CGG repeat size based on capillary electrophoresis (CE) of dTP PCR amplicons was also evaluated. Materials and Methods: The assays were initially optimized on 29 FMR1 re ference DNA samples, followed by a blinded validation on 107 previously characterized patient DNA samples. Results: Samples carrying an expanded allele generated dTP PCR melt pro files with pronounced rightward shift to higher T m range. All normal and ex pansion carriers were accurately classified by dTP PCR MCA, and the FMR1 genotypic classification of the clinical samples was completely concordant with the previously determined genotypes as well as the dTP PCR CE re sults. In addition, we also tested the ability of the assays in detecting low level mosaicism for FMR1 expansion using artificial DNA mixtures. Conclusions: When used in a large scale screening setting, this simple and cost effective MCA based first line screening tool could rapidly screen out the large majority of unaffected individuals, thus minimizing the number of samples that need to be analyzed by Southern analysis.

23568,"B. Rossi Hospital, University of Verona, Verona, Italy. The hyperpolarization activated cyclic nucleotide gated channel (HCN1 4) family has important roles in the control of heart rate and neuronal excita bility. HCN channels selectively conduct K+/Na+ inward current after hy perpolarized potential. In neurons, HCN channels participate in a variety of functions among which excitabily, dendritic integration and plasticity. Animal models have indicated that dysregulation of these channels is as sociated with several forms of epilepsy including febrile seizures, absence and temporal lobe epilepsy as well as other neurological disorders. Recently HCN1 point mutations have been found in individuals with early onset epi leptic encephalopathy with features resembling Dravet syndrome but with different progression over time. All of them developed intellectual disability and autistic traits. Here we report the case of a 9 year old girl with a Rett like phenotype, cha racterized by intellectual disability, hand stereotypies, absent speech, nega tive brain MRI and EEG data and no history of epilepsy. By NGS approach, with the use of a targeted intellectual disability/epilepsy gene panel, we found the girl to carry a novel de novo heterozygous missense mutation in exon 4 of the HCN1 gene. This mutation is located in the glycine tyrosine glycine (GYG) motif, which constitutes the ion selectivity filter typical of K+ permeable channels. This motif is highly conserved structurally and functio nally during evolution. This is the first report of a HCN1 mutation involved in a neurodevelopmen tal phenotype without epilepsy.",2015

While several mutations in HDAC8 have been identified in patients with Cornelia de Lange syndrome (CdLS) one single mutation identified in a large family with Wilsson Turner syndrome (WTS).We have performed gene panel sequencing analysis on a two year old girl with unclear diagnosis and found a novel de novo HDAC8 mutation. The identified mutation (c.910+1G>A) affects the conserved splice donor site of the HDAC8 gene and is predicted to results in an aberrantly spliced mRNA that might be degraded by nonsense mediated mRNA decay or encode a truncated HDAC8 protein. The patient was born to healthy non consanguineous parents, aged 38 mo ther and 42 father. The pregnancy and delivery were uneventful, born at 38 w.g., birth weight 2700 g, birth length 47 cm. The girl presented with a growth delay (length at 4SD, weight 3SD, head circumference 3SD), delayed fontanel closure, and delayed teeth eruption. She showed delayed psychomotor development, sitting steadily at the age of 15 months, did not walk and had no speech by the age of two years. The following dysmorphic features and anomalies were noticed: round face, low forehead, hypertelo rism, deep set eyes, epicanthus, concomitant convergent strabismus, entro pion, astigmatism, thick eyebrows, synophrys, long eyelashes, hypoplastic supra orbital ridges, flat zygomatic region, large nose with bread prominent base, prominent columella, short philtrum, thin lips, medial cleft palate, mi crognathia, posteriorly rotated dysplastic ears, short neck, rocker bottom feet, and impaired conductive hearing.

23570,"Chromosome region 1q21.1 is structurally very complex formed by several segmental duplications that make it prone to non allelic homologous re combination (NAHR). It can be divided into a proximal region containing 16 genes and a distal region containing 13 genes. Array Comparative Ge nomic Hybridization (array CGH) has led to the identification of new syn dromes including microdeletion 1q21.1 and 1q21.1 microduplication. Cli nical features of patients include intellectual disability (ID) and dysmorphic features. Clinical variability and lack of distinct facial dysmorphisms have been reported in individuals affected by these imbalances, making genetic counseling very challenging. Oligonucleotide array CGH analysis using an Agilent 180K platform was per formed in 1200 patients with ID, autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and con genital anomalies. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis usingc SureFISH probes was performed in patients for validation and in parents to determine the origin of 1q21.1 rearrangements. We identified 8 probands with imbalances involving the distal 1q21.1 region (6 deletions and 2 duplications) and 1 proband with a duplication invol ving the proximal region. Inheritance was unknown in 5 patients, 2 micro deletions had arisen de novo and 2 microdeletions was inherited from an unaffected mother. All 9 patients with 1q21.1 imbalances revealed mental retardation, microcephaly/macrocephaly and dysmorphic features. Array CGH is a useful tool for 1q21.1 rearrangements screening. Duplica tions were less frequent in our cohort, consistent with recent studies for NAHR. Patients with 1q21.1 imbalances have a considerable phenotypic di versity that could be associated with incomplete penetrance and variable expressivity.

23571,"Objectives: A patient with intellectual disability, developmental delay and basal ganglia abnormal signal on MRI was evaluated for disease gene iden tification. We aimed to identify the gene responsible for this patientÃ¢ÂÂs phe notype. Methods: The patient is Jordanian Arab from a consanguineous marriage. Samples from her parents and two unaffected sisters were also collected and DNA extracted. Homozygosity mapping was analyzed using Illumina chip microarray. Candidate gene was sequenced using Sanger sequencing. Bioinformatic analysis was done utilizing web based tools. Results: Diffe rent homozygosity intervals were characterized. PTBP1 (poylpyrimidine tract binding protein 1) gene was identified as a candidate gene within a homozygous interval. PTBP1 relative expression level contributes to esta blishing neural specific alternative splicing patterns and is a key player in alternative splicing of many genes associated to lineage specific cell diffe rentiation. Sequencing PTBP1 identified a homozygous silent mutation in exon 7 (c.708C>T , pH236H) that co segregated within the family. This mutation was not reported in any database before nor was it detec ted in 400 control chromosomes from the same population. Bioinformatic testing of DNA sequence by exon splicing enhancer finder identified the sequence where the mutation lies as an exonic enhancer bound by SRSF1 (IgM BRCA1) with a score of 2.03.Conclusion: Our data suggest that this unique homozygous mutation might play a role in the pathogenesis of this patient.

Intellectual disability (ID) has an incidence of 2% and overlaps with autism. It is characterized by a striking genetic heterogeneity that underlies a phe notypic heterogeneity in severity and in associated medical problems. Pro gress in genome analysis has allowed the identification of many recurrent CNVs and of more than 400 genes implicated in monogenic forms of ID/autism. An increasing number of genetic diagnoses are made in individuals with ID/autism but the genetic heterogeneity renders extremely difficult the determination of genotype phenotype correlations and natural history. Symptomatic treatments for comorbidities are proposed with limited op portunities to assess their efficacies or potential adverse effects. We have initiated the development of an alternative database model for specific genetic causes of ID/autism, organized in a social network format whereby most clinical information is entered by the family of the patient based on wide range questionnaires translated in different languages. Con tacts between families affected by the same genetic cause is possible in an anonymous way, creating gene or CNV specific social networks to which in terested professionals could be associated, akin to disease specific patients associations. Anonymized summary data will be accessible to families and to professionals. We will present the structure and features of the GenIDA social network that is currently in its beta testing phase.

In contrast to the generally observed absence of speech one of our patients harboring a novel missense mutation is the first reported pati ent being able to speak several single words at the age of 4 years functioning at the mild to moderate intellectual disability level (IQ55). In addition we observed absence of seizures in the second patient harboring a missense mutation indicating a milder phenotypic expression in some patients with missense mutations.

Next generation sequencing techni ques help to elucidate the genetic background of ID. Apart from fragile X syndrome which is a common cause of ID (7%) and which has been part of the routine diagnostic work up for years, more than 1000 other genetic diseases for intellectual disability are known to date. Material and Methods: Following in solution enrichment of 526 ID linked genes (exons and splice sites), we sequenced 20 female and male affected children and their parents (trio) in whom genomic imbalances and fragile X syndrome had been excluded.

The pathogenic role of mutations was evaluated through sequence comparisons and structural analysis was performed to predict the effect of alterations in a 3D computational model through molecular dyna mics simulations. Additionally a genotype phenotype correlation has been performed. This approach allowed us to find new pathogenic mutations with a detection rate close to 11% in our cohort.

Therefore the purpose of the present study was to identify the genetic cause of ID in one syndromic and two non syndromic Pakistani families. Whole exome of three ID probands was sequenced. Missense variations in two plausible novel genes implicated in autosomal recessive ID were identified: lysine (K) specific methyltrans ferase 2B (KMT2B), zinc finger protein 589 (ZNF589), as well as hedgehog acyltransferase (HHAT) with a de novo mutation with autosomal domi nant mode of inheritance. The KMT2B recessive variant is the first report of recessive Kleefstra syndrome like phenotype. Identification of plausible causative mutations for two recessive and a dominant type of ID, in genes not previously implicated in disease underscores the large genetic hetero geneity of ID. These results also support the viewpoint that large number of ID genes converge on limited number of common networks i.e. ZNF589 belongs to KRAB domain zinc finger proteins previously implicated in ID, HHAT is predicted to affect sonic hedgehog, which is involved in several disorders with ID, KMT2B associated with syndromic ID fits the epigene tic module underlying the Kleefstra syndromic spectrum.

(Am J Hum Genet 2014, 94(1):87 94) described a large Amish pedigree where homozygous or compound hetero zygous mutations in KPTN gene encoding kaptin protein resulted in a clini cally distinctive syndrome consisting of macrocephaly, global developmen tal delay, behavioural abnormalities, and seizures (MIM 615637). Here we report the second case of KPTN related syndrome in two Estonian siblings with novel homozygous KPTN mutation and similar phenotype. CASE REPORT: The probands are 32 years old brother and 24 years old si ster from Estonia. The parents are non consanguineous, but were born in the same parish. The brother and sister have macrocephaly, with occipito frontal circumference of 63 cm (+4.5 SD) and 60 cm (+4 SD) respectively. Their intellectual disability could be classified as moderate. The verbal abi lities are more affected than the motor development in both siblings. Beha vioural problems and a few episodes of seizures were present only in the brother. METHODS AND RESULTS: Whole exome sequencing identified homozygous one nucleotide frameshift duplication in KPTN gene (c.665dupA:p. Q222fs). Homozygosity of both affected siblings and heterozygosity of parents was confirmed by Sanger sequencing. SNP array showed a 1.5 Mb homozygous stretch encompassing KPTN gene in both siblings. CONCLUSIONS: With this report we confirm the pathogenicity of KPTN gene mutations and delineate the core phenotype of the novel autosomal reces sive genetic syndrome. We also prove the hypothesis of the first describing authors that KPTN related syndrome is not restricted to Amish population.

23585,"Background Recent studies have assigned important functions to lncRNAs in gene regu lation and protein interactions. Since many of these lncRNAs emerged re cently during vertebrate and primate evolution, a crucial role in the human brain is anticipated. Here, we aimed at identifying candidate lncRNAs asso ciated with neuronal development and intellectual disability (ID). MethodsA strategy was defined using publically available data regarding neuron spe cific histon modifications, REST binding & DNAse 1 hypersensitivity. This was complemented with extensive expression profiling of both coding and noncoding genes in seven nonneuronal tissues and eight brain samples. As a proof of principle, this approach was first applied to all RefSeq coding ge nes. Results Of the coding genes, 4040 met the criteria of having a neuron specific H3K4 me3 mark, REST binding and DNAse 1 hypersensitivity in the promoter re gion (filter 1) as well as a relatively high expression in at least one brain sample (filter 2). A significant enrichment of ID genes was noted in this list (178/4040) and in 65 genes, a GWAS hit for neuropsychiatric disorders was observed; indicating the power of this approach. When applied to 32108 lncRNA transcripts (lncipedia 2.1), 2980 lncRNAs passed filter step 1. While the majority of lncRNAs have a relatively low ex pression, an enrichment of lncRNAs passing filter step 2 was seen (215/2980 versus 1360/32108). A GWAS hit was noted in one of these lncRNAs. ConclusionUsing this integrated approach, we identified 215 interesting candidate ln cRNAs for neuronal development. These lncRNAs will be functionally vali dated.",2015

In a large cohort of patients with unexplained intellectual disability (ID), de Ligt et al (2012) listed a de novo missense mutation in MIB1 as candidate for ID. We observed a family consisting of three siblings born to healthy non consanguineous Dutch parents. A girl died at the age of 9 months from complications of extra hepatic bile duct atresia, abdominal situs inversus, polysplenism and intestinal malrotation. Two male siblings, at present 11 and 7.5 years old, presented with comparable problems consisting of failure to thrive, delayed motor developmental, microcephaly, intellectual disability, friendly beha vior, delayed and nasal speech, large nose bridge and small nares, pointed chin, small mouth, high palate with teeth malocclusion, thin upper lip, fea tureless philtrum, large ears, short neck, fair complexion, kyphoscoliosis, barrel shaped chest. Cardiac screening of the eldest child at 2.5 years sho wed a slightly enlarged right ventricle, but was otherwise normal. Whole exome sequencing of DNA from both sibs showed two shared compound heterozygous changes in MIB1 , one maternally inherited highly conserved missense variant,c.244G>A in the zinc finger domain and the other in the splice donor site for exon 3 (c.531+1G>T), adjacent to the Mib Herc2 do main.

23587,"Cytogenetic microarray (CMA) allows the elucidation of 15 to 20 percent of remaining unexplained cases of intellectual disability. A threshold of 400 kb is proposed to consider Copy Number Variants (CNV). Array use in dia gnostic setting could detect smaller CNV mostly polymorphic generating numerous confirmations. Here, we propose to evaluate the diagnostic in terest of small CNV (inferior to 400kb) in intellectual disability (ID). This collaborative study groups an Illumina SNP array platform and an Agilent CGH array platform for a total of 3330 patients explored for syndromic or isolated intellectual disability from 2011 to 2014.Over 26,866 CNV detected, 22,683 (84.4%) were smaller than 400 kb. Among the 1440 CNVs considered as relevant, 850 (40.9 %) were smal ler than 400 kb increasing by 70% the amount of necessary confirmation by another technique. We concluded that 44 of 605 (7.3%) of these CNVs (smaller than 400kb) were pathogenic. 36 were deletions which involved pathogenic gene in ID and 8 were duplications. It is noteworthy that, except a MECP2 duplication, all small duplications were either intragenic or pro bably truncating an ID gene possibly leading to haploinsufficiency. To conclude, analyzing CNV smaller than 400 kb significantly increases the number of verification but enhances the diagnostic yield of 1.3 % in pati ents with ID, which is equivalent to 44 patients in our cohort. However, we propose not to consider small non truncating duplications. While massive ly parallel sequencing techniques are becoming routine diagnosis, it seems preferable to detect as many pathogenic CNVs as possible using CMA.",2015
23588,"Protein translation is an essential cellular process initiated by the associa tion of a methionyl tRNA with the translation initiation factor eIF2. The met tRNA/eIF2 complex then associates with ribosomal subunits and other translation factors, which together comprise the translational machinery. This process is regulated by the phosphorylation status of the ÃÂ± subunit of eIF2 (eIF2ÃÂ±); phosphorylated eIF2ÃÂ± attenuates protein translation. Here we report a consanguineous family with severe microcephaly, failure to thrive and intellectual disability in two siblings.

R658C PPP1R15B mutation is located within the PPP1C binding site. We show that patient cells have greatly diminished levels of PPP1R15B PPP1C interaction, which results in increased eIF2ÃÂ± phosphorylation and resistance to cellular stress. Final ly, we find that patient cells have elevated levels of PPP1R15B mRNA and protein, suggesting activation of a compensatory program aimed at resto ring cellular homeostasis which is ineffective due to PPP1R15B deficiency.

An overview is given by Ro senfeld et al., reviewing twelve reported cases of the literature and propo sing phenotype genotype correlation [Rosenfeld et al. 2012]. However, an isolated microdeletion of the sub band 6q22.33 has not been described so far and thus, no information is available concerning the specific phenotype associated with such a copy number variation.

Genetic disorders affect a large proportion of the population and result in substantial economic and social burden. The rapid advances in genome se quencing have created an opportunity to rapidly and more universally iden tify disease causing gene mutations, facilitating more efficient diagnosis and improved disease management and prevention. Here we have compared the costs of disability resulting from gene mutations with the potential health and social benefits of implementing whole genome testing for the detection of significant monogenic diseases. We found that the annual costs of intellec tual and physical disability are substantial with average costs ranging from about $40,000 per annum for children with an intellectual disability to over $400,000 for young adults with severe intellectual disability. The aetiology of many conditions associated with intellectual and/or physical disability can be identified through clinical genomic sequencing at a current cost (in cluding analysis) of ~US$10,000, although that cost should decline rapidly with continued technological advances and especially the development of well curated genotype phenotype correlation databases. Different applica tions of clinical genomic sequencing offer varying abilities to avoid cases of disability with greater benefits likely to be realized the earlier in the repro ductive cycle testing is offered. The potential to mitigate even a fraction of the costs and social impacts associated with disability through clinical geno mic sequencing makes a compelling socioeconomic case for consideration of implementation of such testing as well as the construction of supporting national and international databases.",2015

We studied a series of 36 patients with ID who have been extensively inve stigated without diagnosis. From our first results, this method allowed us to disclose diagnoses that were unexpected owing to: the mild phenotype of a known syndrome, well exemplified by a sibpair with apparently non syndromic ID carrying an ATRX mutation the limited knowledge about very rare and/or poorly described pheno types or the lack of specificity of a given disorder, as illustrated by a patient with a GRIA3 mutation the limited knowledge about the early phenotype of some progressive di seases with developmental delay, as exemplified by a young patient with ID but without typical brain MR images carrying PANK2 mutations.

Result revealed a recurrent mutation in NRAS, c.179G>A (p. G60E), in the index patient. This mutation was inherited from patientÃ¢ÂÂs father, which also showed signs of NS. Neither of the affected individuals in this family presented with juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML), which together with previously results suggest that the risk for NS individuals with a germline NRAS developing JMML is not different from the proportion seen in other NS cases. 50% of NS individuals with an NRAS mutation present with lentigines and/or CafÃÂ© au lait spots, demonstrating predisposition to hyperpigmented lesions in NRAS positive NS individuals. Moreover, the affected father in our family presented with a hearing deficit since birth, which together with lentigines are two characteristics of NS with multiple lentigines (previously LEOPARD syndrome), supporting the difficulties in diagnosing individuals with RAS opathies correctly.

Both were born at term, with normal birth weights. The affected boy had multiple type seizures (atypical absence and drop attacks) from age 3 months, while his sister had mild atypical absences from age 6 years. Both siblings (currently 11.5 years and 10 years old respectively) have severe ID with expressive language impairment, but are both normocephalic with normal brain imaging and mild dysmorphic features.

Copy number variations (CNV) in RBFOX1, also known as A2BP1, have been associated with human neurodevelopmental disease, including autism spectrum disease. This gene, spanning 1.7 MB on chromosome 16p13.3, is one of the largest genes in the human genome, responsible for encoding splicing regulatory factors, specifically expressed in neurons and muscles, and having a regula tory action in alternative splicing of a large tissue specific gene networks. Materials and methods: Oligonucleotide array CGH analysis, using an Agi lent 4x180K platform, was performed in 1200 patients with mental retarda tion, autism spectrum disorders and congenital anomalies. Results: In our cohort, we identified 6 cases with intragenic deletions in RB FOX1, 4 of them with additional CNV in other chromosomes. These CNVs are located at 16p13.3, extended in a 1,2Mb region between 6,087,983 7 ,207,012 (GRCh37/hg19), which corresponds to intronic regions in 5 out of 6 patients. Five of these patients have an inherited deletion, from an unaffec ted progenitor, and one has an unknown inheritance pattern. Conclusions: The phenotypes of all these children have in common, as wide ly described, neurological alterations. The rearrangements identified lead to a reduction in RBFOX1 expression, corroborating the importance of RBFOX1 haploinsufficiency in this phenotypes.

In this case, an 8 year old male pre sented with clinical features of RTT including: microcephaly, Chiari I mal formation, neurodevelopmental regression, seizures, bradykinesia, apnea and stereotyped midline hand movements. MECP2 analysis identified both a normal sequence and a c.1A>T (p. Met1?) mutation in peripheral blood and fibroblasts with normal dosage by multiplex ligation dependent probe amplification (MLPA). This has only been reported in females with classic RTT . Somatic mosaicism for classic RTT mutations has rarely been reported in males, however, this is the first known case involving the start codon of MECP2, p. M1. Subsequent analysis by array comparative genomic hybridi zation (aCGH) did not identify copy number changes in MECP2 but did pick up a 172 kb deletion of Xq21.31, which is considered unlikely to contribute to the patientÃ¢ÂÂs phenotype. The unbalanced heterozygous mutation suggests somatic mosaicism. Although a small duplication cannot be ruled out given the limitations of our array and MLPA probes, this is felt to be less likely to be the mechanism.

The older boy had abnormal EEG and showed absence seizures since the age of 9 years. The younger boy presented ataxia at the age of 5 years. Their mother showed mild ID, as did the maternal grandmother and a maternal uncle. WES of the brothers and their mother identified a heterozygous splicing SC N8A mutation (NM_014191, c.1134+1G>A) which was absent in all exome databases. It was confirmed using Sanger sequencing in both boys, their mo ther, grandmother and uncle, and predicted to disrupt the splice donor of in tron 9, with exon 9 skipping being one of the likely outcomes. Sequencing of lymphocyte cDNA of the carriers confirmed this aberrant transcript leading to frameshift and premature termination (p. G331GfsX11). The interpreta tion of this variant transcript is however complicated by its presence also in normal controls. Other variant transcripts and differences in transcript ratios are under study. Multiple SCN8A mutations have been reported, mostly de novo missense variants in patients showing predominantly seizures, while one truncating variant segregated in a family with a broader spectrum of cognitive and be havioural deficits.

Although many genes respon sible for these conditions have been discovered, the aetiology and disease pathogenesis of most forms remains poorly understood. Materials and Methods: Using a combination of autozygosity mapping and whole exome sequencing (WES), we studied an autosomal recessive neuro developmental disorder with seizures, craniofacial dysmorphism and other features found among the Amish community. Results: Whole genome mapping of family members from two sibships using HumanSNPCyto 12 DNA Analysis BeadChip revealed a homozygous region on chromosome 1p34 common to the three affected children. Exome sequencing of one affected child identified a novel homozygous mutation in SNIP1 c.1097A>G (p. Glu366Gly) as the likely causative variant. The variant cosegregated with the disease phenotype in the families investigated as well as a further seven affected individuals from four other nuclear Amish fami lies. Five heterozygous carriers of the mutation were identified among 350 Amish controls, which is not unexpected in this genetic isolate. Mutation pathogenicity was predicted through five in silico programs. Conclusions: Our findings define the clinical spectrum associated with bial lelic mutation in SNIP1, which we show to be the likely cause of the severe neurodevelopmental disorder in these families. Assessing the functional outcomes of the missense mutation in the encoded protein and its regulato ry function will expand our knowledge about the essential role of SNIP1 in growth and development of the brain or central nervous system.

23605,"Snyder Robinson syndrome (SRS) is a probably underdiagnosed X linked disorder characterized by intellectual disability, dysmorphic face, muscle hypotonia, kyphoscoliosis, osteoporosis, seizures, and speech and gait ab normalities. SRS is causedby mutations in spermine Synthase (SMS), but diagnosis of SRS has been hampered by lack of a specific biomarker that can be measured in body flu ids or native cells. The balance of spermine and spermidine is maintained by SMS and is crucial for proper chromatin structure, ion channel regulation, transcription and translation. We established the diagnosis of SRS by clinical exome sequencing in two no vel monozygotic twin patients and subsequently demonstrated an abnormal spermine/spermidine ratio in cultured lymphoblasts. The novel Arg130Cys mutation is predicted to diminish enzymatic activity by decreasing dimer stability and affecting the structure of the adjacent spermine binding site. The third SRS patient investigated was published previously (Mastrangelo et al. 2013). Differential expression profiling of metabolites in the SRS pa tients revealed a high peak that was absent in controls. After identification of the SMS mutation, the abnormal peak could be readily identified as N acetylspermidine, a polyamine intermediate product involved in spermine and spermidine metabolism. Thus we conclude that spermine synthase de ficiency leads to intracellular accumulation of spermidine, which is conver ted to N acetylspermidine and exported from the cell. Therefore targeted or untargeted plasma analysis of N acetylspermidine represents a powerful screening marker for SRS relying on a single blood plasma sample.

23606,"We report on a family included in a trio exome sequencing study performed on 250 patients with intellectual disability. The 15 year old boy is the first and only child of healthy, non consanguineous German parents, born at term after a pregnancy complicated by uterus myomatosus and gestosis. Birth measurements were normal but green am niotic fluid was noted. The boy walked independently with 2 ÃÂ½ years and never learned to speak and he is not toilet trained. Seizures started with 4 years of age and could be treated effectively. Agitated behavior and autistic features needed medication. Brain MRI revealed reduced temporal gyri on the left. The patient attends a special school and behaves like a toddler. Body measurements were normal throughout life, but head circumference was above the 97th centile. The patient has a high and broad forehead, promi nent lips and small hands and feet. Trio exome sequencing revealed a maternally inherited frame shift muta tion (c.841delC, p.(Gly281Ser fs*33)) and a paternally inherited missense mutation in SZT2 gene (c.9787G>A, p.(Asp3263Asn)). The possibly dama ging missense mutation may lead to a residual protein function and cause a milder phenotype resembling the three brothers described by Falcone et al (2013) who are homozygous for a 3 bp in frame deletion. Patients with homozygous or compound heterozygous truncating mutations as described by Basel Vanagaite et al (2013) show severe infantile encephalopathy with epilepsy. This sixth patient broadens the phenotypic spectrum caused by mutations in SZT2 gene showing an intermediate clinical course compared to the patients published to date.",2015
23607,"We have recently reported the results of targeted sequencing (TS) of 217 genes implicated in intellectual disability in 106 patients (mostly males) with ID and no diagnosis after CGH array and phenotype driven testing of candidate genes (Redin et al. J Med Genet 2014). The diagnostic yield after stringent evaluation was 26% (23% for sporadic ID cases). We have now extended this using an improved panel of 275 genes, and have tested ano ther 200 patients. Our current results confirm a diagnostic yield of 20 to 25%. Our results indicate that de novo mutations in few genes, such as DYR K1A or TCF4, are found recurrently in ID patients and may account each for 1 2% of cases (ie not far from the incidence of fragile X). The update of our gene list allowed us to identify mutations in very recently identified ID genes, such as NAA10, TBR1, POGZ, TRIO, ZBTB20 (Primrose syndrome). We also report the first non consanguineous and compound heterozygous case of AP4S1 ID with spastic paraplegia. Whole exome sequencing (WES) performed for fifteen individuals with no mutation identified after targeted sequencing (TS) did not reveal any obvious mutation in other genes not in cluded in the panel. The large decrease in the depth of coverage obtained for WES compared to TS (60X vs 300X) made CNV analysis (with depth of coverage based methods) and variant detection less efficient for our genes of interest. Therefore, until prices fall and coverage increase, targeted se quencing of candidate genes remains a useful method for routine diagnosis of intellectual disability.",2015

The patients have distinctive facial features, microcephaly, developmental delay, and possible heart and genitourinary malformations. Reverse phenotyping confirmed the presence of similar facial features, in cluding tall forehead with high anterior hairline, deep set eyes with short, upslanted palpebral fissures, long nose with low hanging columella, and thick vermilion of the upper and lower lip. Other common features included the severe speech difficulties and the presence of genital malformations.

We chose to ge nerate a mouse model for the X linked dominant form of NBIA (neurodege neration with brain iron acculumation), caused by de novo loss of function mutations in WDR45. In humans, the course of disease is two staged with developmental delay and intellectual disability in childhood and a second phase of rapid neurological deterioration characterized by parkinsonism and dementia occurring in early adulthood with characteristic neuroima ging findings such as hypointense signals in substantia nigra and globus pallidus. Microinjection of TALEN mRNA into oocytes resulted in 19% mu tated founders (5/26). Mutations were deletions between 10 and 57bp with a frameshift in 4/5 mutations.

Recent stu dies have suggested a possible causal relationship of this genomic rearran gement with an abnormal phenotype, indicating that it may be a risk factor for intellectual disability. In an effort to clarify the significance of these duplications we report the genotype, the inheritance and the clinical features of six females with in terstitial duplications of Xp22.31 ranging in size from 1,48 Mb to 1.76 Mb found by array CGH analysis. Five of these individuals presented intellectual disability, whereas the genomic rearrangement was an incidental finding in the sixth individual. The duplicated X chromosome was inherited in all the five patients. The inheritance was mainly paternal and all parents were clinically unaffected. Although the Xp22.31 triplication has been suggested to be more penetrant than the corresponding duplication, we found four copy of this region in one patient and three copy in her unaffected father. In contrast with the more recent reports that increased the confidence about the pathogenicity of the Xp22.31 microduplication, our findings do not allow to confirm its association with a disease phenotype and cannot exclude the possibility that this is a rare population variant.",2015

There was no minimum duplicated critical region shared by all these duplications. Ten individuals had mild to severe mental impairment but one individual was normally intelligent.

In Denmark, blood spots have been stored since 1981 and combined with the well characterized clinical information from the Danish registers, DBS is a valuable research opportunity for genetic population based studies. The aim of this study is to evaluate the quality of copy number variants(CNV) in DNA derived from blood spots as well as to determine phenotypic risk with the known 22q11Del. DNA from 209 individuals identified from the Danish cytogenetic registry as carriers of a 22q11Del was extracted from DBS. Since blood spots contain limited amount of DNA, the DNA extraction step was carried out in parallel with and without the whole genome amplification (WGA) step. The samples were genotyped with the Illumina Psych Array and PennCNV was applied for CNV prediction. Compared to unamplified genomic DNA, WGA DNA severely increases the CNV false positive rate. The true positive rate was not affected for the diffe rent versions of 22q11Del.

Three recent publications have demonstrated positive effects of Early Hormonal Treat ment (EHT) during infancy. Methods: 42 males prenatally diagnosed with XXY participated in compre hensive neurdevelopmental assesments. This retrospective study had three treatment groups: EHT with HBT , HBT Only, and untreated. Data was analy zed one year before and one year after treatment. For the untreated group we used data points within 12 months of the treatment groups. Results: The EHT+HBT group showed significantly better perfomance than the HBT Only group on Fine Motor Control(p,.024) and PSI(p,.004). The EHT+HBT group also showed better performance than the untreated group on motor tests; Fine Motor(p,.017), Running Speed(p,.031), Strength(p,.032), the Motor Composite (p,.023), as well as on the WISC VCI(p,.019), PRI(p,.021), and FSIQ(p,.004). The HBT Only group perfor med significantly better than the untreated group on the VCI(p,.020) and PIQ(p,.010). There was a significant drop in PIQ in the untreated group over time (p,.033), while the treated groups did not decline. Conclusions: Multiple positive effects of Testosterone replacement were observed in boys with 47, XXY, supporting the need for early identification and treatment of these boys. The significant results were observed in the EHT+HBT group. The untreated group showed a decline in PIQ over time. This suggests that, without treatment, some cognitive functioning may de cline in young boys with 47,XXY.

The ID gene set was significantly associated with ADHD in the PGC ADHD meta analysis (P gene set,2.19E 3). Further analysis showed that the findings were due to the inattention symptom domain (P gene set,5.00E 3) rather than hyperactivity/impulsivity in ADHD (Pgene set,0.203). The MEF2C gene showed gene wide association (corrected for multiple testing) with ADHD risk (PMEFC2,3.92E 5). Two SNPs within the MEF2C locus were assessed on neuroanatomy using voxel based morphometry (VBM) in the Brain Imaging Genetics cohort (BIG; N>1,300) and one SNP showed bilateral association with gray matter volume in the la teral occipital cortex. This study demonstrates the genetic overlap between ID and ADHD, showing that common SNPs in genes, known to be affected by rare genetic variations in ID patients, contribute to ADHD risk.

DISC1 (disrupted in schizophrenia 1) and COMT (catechol O methyltransferase) are associated with the pathogenesis of neurocognitive impairment. The Val158Met (rs4680, G>A) polymorphism in COMT and Ser736Cys (rs821616, T>A) in DISC1 genes have shown association with various neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative diseases. Several studies implicated them in the cognitive impairment and different neuropsychiatric features. Materials and methods: In this study 218 patients with AD and 125 healthy controls, matched to the patients by age, gender and ethnicity (HC) were included. Genotypes were determined using TaqMan assay (Applied Biosy stems). Statistical analysis was done using PLINK . Results and discussion: The Val158Met and Ser736Cys polymorphisms did not show significant difference in allele frequency distribution between the AD and HC group.

Single nucleotide polymor phisms (SNPs) of genes encoding VEGF A and its receptor, VEGFR 2, eNOS or TP53 might modulate the risk of these global health problems. OBJECTIVES: We have analyzed the relationship of the following SNPs: 460C>T and 2578A>C of VEGFA, 604A>G of VEGFR2, +894G>T of eNOS and Arg72Pro of TP53 as well as sociodemographic and clinical risk factors VD develop (and its subtypes) and EA. We have analyzed 150 patients with VD (corticalVD,74; subcortical VD,76), 147 patients with AD and 150 controls >70 years that there was no evidence of clinical or psychometric cognitive impairment. Genotyping was accom plished by DNA digestion with restriction nucleases (PCR RFLP) and PCR with TaqmanÃÂ® probes (qRT PCR).RESULTS: Our results showed that VEGFA alleles 460C 2578A (OR:0.625, p,0.042) and eNOS allele +894G (OR:0.606, p,0.037) were associated with lower risk of EA in patients older than 80 years.

23621,"Hereditary Cerebellar Ataxia (HCA) is a slowly progressive disorder cha racterized by the presence of abnormal and uncoordinated movements that mainly affect walking, speech and eye movement. Its diagnosis is not straightforward, mainly due to the presence of nonspecific overlapping clini cal symptoms and of genetic heterogeneity. A global approach using massive technologies such as NGS could be of great help to improve the diagnosis. We present a dataset of 28 ataxic patients studied in our laboratory using a NGS targeted re sequencing panel that included genes associated with Ata xia [between 1 30 genes]. Coding exons and splice site regions of the genes associated with each pathology were analyzed. Enrichment and sequencing were carried out using SureSelect Enrichment System (Agilent) and SOLiD 5500/MiSeq(Life Technologies/Illumina). Mean depth was established at 200x. In 6 out of 28 samples (21%), a genetic cause that justifies the clinical dia gnosis was found. In 12 out of 28 patients the results were inconclusive. In these samples, 41 variants (confirmed by Sanger sequencing) were identi fied as variants of uncertain significance (VUS).

Conclusions: NGS is powerful in diagnosing hereditary ataxias but also provides a large number of variants requiring careful clinical evaluation. As our results indicate it is possible to diagnose even patients with a late onset or negative family history for mutations in ataxia related genes.<br",2015
23623,"A T is an early childhood progressive multisystem neurodegenerative disor der characterised by cerebellar ataxia, immunodeficiency, lung disease and a high risk of malignancy. Median survival is estimated at 25 years, but seve rity is variable and management is improving the quality of life and survival. A T is recessively inherited and caused by mutations in the ATM gene on chromosome 11q.26. A T is rare; in the UK and Ireland there are approxi mately 170 cases. England has a nationally commissioned Paediatric A T Clinic based in Not tingham and sees children from the UK and overseas. There are two funda mental aims, to achieve an accurate diagnosis and to manage the patient holistically, addressing every aspect of the condition. The Clinical Team comprises over 20 specialists and collaborates with the A T Society support group. Clinic is held 6 times a year and sees 6 children per clinic over 2 days. Generally, patients are reviewed every 2 years with ongoing contact with their local Paediatric Teams. We have recently published a guidance docu ment on diagnosis and clinical care for children with A T . Involvement in research and family education are integral parts of this Service. The poster will describe the patient pathway, specific medical interventions undertaken in the clinic and/or arranged through local services as well as clinical outcomes and implications for management. Examples are the un derlying ATM mutations, the nutritional status of patients, the prevalence of skin disease and scoliosis and the results of respiratory, immunological and other investigations undertaken.

23624,"Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is highly heritable psych iatric disorder with a heritability estimates ranging from 60 to 90 %. To identify rare variants associated to ADHD, we performed exome sequencing based association study in a genetically isolated population in the Nether lands. The study included 554 individuals whose exomes were sequenced and who were assessed for inattention, hyperactivity and ADHD index. All single nucleotide (SNVs) variants were tested for association applying additive linear modeling adjusting for age, sex and relatedness among the samples. Moreover Sequence Kernel Association Test (SKAT) was used to test the joint effect of multiple variants within the gene/region. Significant association of two rare SNVs (MAF , 0.27 %, ÃÂ² , 12.70, p value , 9.36E 08) mapped to intronic part of multiple C2 domains, transmembrane 1 (MCTP1) gene on chromosome 5 was observed with inattention. Gene based analy sis revealed suggestive association of CEACAM19 (p value , 1.91E 05) and SCYL2 (p value , 1.35E 05) to inattention and hyperactivity, respectively. To conclude, present study identifies exome wide association between ASD and two SNVs within MCTP1 gene, which play important role in Ca2+ si gnalling at membrane.

23625,"From genome wide association studies (GWAS), a novel gene was discove red that has a highly significant association with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). The gene is a long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) designated MSNP1AS (moesin pseudogene 1, antisense). Expression of MSNP1AS was increased in the cerebral cortex of individuals with ASD and individuals with the ASD associated genetic marker. Overexpression of MSNP1AS in human neuronal cells caused decreased expression of moesin (MSN) mRNA and moesin pro tein, which is involved in neuronal process stability and immune response. These data indicate one aspect of the potential contribution of increased MSNP1AS expression in ASD. However, there are likely to be additional transcriptomic impacts of this lncRNA. To determine the effects of altered MSNP1AS expression on the neuronal transcriptome, we transfected human neuronal progenitor cells with constructs that overexpressed MSNP1AS or transcriptionally silenced MSNP1AS. RNA Seq analysis indicated altered expression of multiple genes that contribute to altered neuronal process stability and immune response, including MSN. However, our data indica te several genes that are impacted by MSNP1AS dysregulation more signi ficantly than MSN, suggesting a network of genes that contribute to ASD risk. Ongoing experiments seek to define the role of the MSNP1AS gene network in neuronal process stability.",2015
23626,"Introduction: ASD is a genetically complex disorder, highly heterogeneous and with unclear etiology. In this study we addressed the possible contri bution of epigenetic factors to ASD etiology, focusing on deregulated Mi croRNAs (miRNAs) expression. miRNAs are small noncoding RNA molecules that negatively regulate gene expression. miRNAs are thought to be released from pathological tissues to plasma in illness situations, and the strong correlation between circulating and tissue miRNAs indicates that plasma miRNAs may be useful disease biomarkers. Methods: miRNA plasma profiles were obtained for patients with ASD and other neurodevelopmental disabilities (NDD), essentially disruptive beha vior, language delay and psychomotor delay. Patients were all male, with a mean developmental coefficient of 92ÃÂ±18, and no obvious dysmorphisms. Exiqon human miRNome PCR panels (testing 752 miRNAs) were used for miRNA profiling. Results: We identified 50 miRNAs differentially expressed in ASD vs NDD. Notably, of the 10 miRNAs with higher fold change (increased 2.5 3.3X), 8 miRNAs had a target gene in common, MMP16. This gene is expressed at high levels in the brain, and a balanced de novo translocation in a ASD pati ent involving MMP16 has previously been described. Conclusions: This is the first study of circulating miRNA profiles comparing patients with ASD and other NDDs. The preliminary results suggest that miRNA profilling may eventually improve differential diagnosis. The results also implicate novel pathological pathways in ASD, namely involving metal oproteinases. These are crucial molecules for the integrity of the extracellu lar matrix and consequently for cell migration and regeneration, processes thought to be involved in ASD.",2015

Despite of significant advances in bioinformatics and genomics, analyses of generalized data on copy number variation (CNV) or variome aimed at gene hunting still represent a major challenge. Here, we have used an approach towards identifying genes implicated in autism pathogenesis through eva luation of autistic variome addressed by microarray genome analysis with an original bioinformatic technology. To identify the spectrum of CNV, a high resolution SNP array genome scan (Affymetrix platform) was used. Bioinfor matics analysis has represented a complex evaluation of CNV by simulations of transcriptional, interactomic and metabolomic activity of candidate genes using available genome, transcriptome and proteome databases (Iourov et al., 2014). Pathogenic CNV were found in 38 children with autism from the Russian cohort (n,212). Six chromosomal rearrangements were detected: deletions at 6p11.2 (PRISM2), 9q21.13 (GDA, ZFAND5, TMC1), 8p23.3p23.1 (46 genes), Xp22.12 (RPS6KA3, CNKSR2) and Yq11.223q11.23 duplications. Furthermore, bioinformatic analysis of CNV and single gene deletions/du plications has defined following autism candidate genes: CBARA1, KRT83, RBFOX1, NDP , ATP6V1E1, CNKSR2, ATP1A2, FBXO21, ACSL3, ATP2B3, IM PA1, CNTNAP4. The latter allowed speculations on potential autistic mole cular pathways involving genome instability, programmed cell death and axon guidance. Successful delineation of a panel of candidate genes suggests generalized variome analyses as a valuable source for gene hunting. These data supports the idea that additional bioinformatic technologies are able to give further insights into disease pathogenesis. Thus, a disease variome determined by SNP array genome scan and addressed an original bioinfor matic technology appears to be an issue for genomic studies.

Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a severe neurodevelopmental condi tion with highly complex genetic predisposition. Recent discoveries have highlighted the importance of both sequence and structural rare variations in ASD susceptibility. In particular, focusing on rare copy number variants (CNVs) has already been highly productive in uncovering an increasing num ber of specific genes and chromosomal intervals conferring risk to ASD. During a genome wide CNV scan using a multi algorithm approach on 9 multiplex ASD families from Sardinia, we identified a rare genic deletion of ~37 Kb, transmitted from the unaffected mother to both affected siblings. This deletion includes the entire CAPG gene and the last coding exons of ELMOD3 . CAPG encodes a member of the gelsolin/villin family of actin re gulatory proteins, that might be involved in control of dendritic spine shape. ELMOD3 belongs to the engulfment and cell motility (ELMO) family, with recently proposed functional links to sound perception and actin cytoske leton. No deletions involving this genomic region were found in 4768 controls from published high resolution SNP array data, while other two deletions encompassing CAPG and ELMOD3 have been reported in two subjects with ASD, suggesting that CAPG and/or ELMOD3 haploinsufficiency may have clinical relevance to ASD. In order to test this hypothesis together with a recessive model of inheritance, we first excluded that this deletion is a com mon polymorphism in Sardinia, then we performed expression and muta tion analysis of both genes in the discovery pedigree, and a further clinical evaluation of all family members.

Bipolar disorder (BD) is a major psychiatric disorder affecting more than 1% of the worldÃ¢ÂÂs population. The disease is characterized by recurrent ma nic and depressive episodes and shows a high heritability of about 70%. To date several genes contributing to BD susceptibility have been identified. However, the disease driving pathways and regulatory networks remain lar gely unknown. As the cumulative impact of common alleles with small effect may only explain around 38% of the phenotypic variance for BD (Lee et al., 2011), rare variants of high penetrance have been suggested to contribute to BD risk. In the present study we investigated the role of rare nonsynonymous vari ants in two large Cuban families. The exceptional lifetime prevalence of BD in these pedigrees makes them promising candidates for identifying genetic risk variants of Mendelian like effects. For this purpose we selected 16 affec ted individuals from both families and performed exome sequencing on the HiSeq platform. In addition, all family members with available DNA (n,34) were genotyped on the Illumina Psych Chip to create polygenic risk score analyses in order to evaluate the contribution of common variants in the two pedigrees. Exome sequencing has recently been completed. Preliminary results of the first family revealed 10 missense variants and two frameshift variants shared among all investigated individuals (n,4). Affected genes include AD CY3, a gene that has been suggested to play a role in major depressive dis order, and SEMA4C required for brain development.

23630,"Bipolar Disorder (BD) is a common, genetically complex neuropsychiatric disorder with a significant impact on the global burden of disease. Patients suffer from recurrent episodes of strongly elevated (mania) and depressed mood. The life time prevalence ranges between 0.5 1.5%. Heritability for BD estimates between 60 80%.We have recently published two large Genome Wide Association Studies (GWAS) that provide strong evidence for an involvement of genetic variants in neurocan (NCAN, Cichon et al. 2011) and adenylate cyclase 2 (ADCY2; MÃÂ¼hleisen et al. 2014) in BD. NCAN encodes a glycoprotein that plays a role in neuronal development. ADCY2 is a key enzyme in cAMP regulated GPCR signalling pathways. For GWAS association signals, it is normally unclear whether they represent the functionally relevant variants or just proxies in linkage disequilibrium. Therefore, to uncover the whole mutational spectrum in NCAN and ADCY2 and to detect the putative functional variant underlying the GWAS associati on signal, we conducted a Next Generation Sequencing based re sequencing in 960 German BD patients.

23631,"Bipolar disorder (BD) is a severe neuropsychiatric disorder and GWAS have robustly identified genetic variants implicated in disease susceptibility. Ho wever, the majority of loci are located in non coding regions of the genome, thus requiring further functional annotation. Enhancers are distal regulatory elements that control the activation of tis sue and cell type specific gene expression. Large scale identification of actively transcribed enhancers is performed by different techniques such as chromatin immunoprecipitation or cap analysis gene expression coupled with next generation sequencing. The Fantom5 enhancer atlas (Andersson et al. 2014) represents a systematic resource for active enhancers in tissues including human brain. The integration of GWAS signals and these functio nal genomic regions provides novel opportunities to elucidate biological mechanisms underlying BD. Therefore, we investigated in this study whe ther brain related enhancers are enriched among top BD GWAS hits. Results from the largest BP meta analyses comprising a sample of 24,025 patients and controls (MÃÂ¼hleisen et al. 2014) provided the basis for this ana lysis.

23633,"Introduction : A hexanucleotide GGGGCC expansion in C9ORF72 accounts for up to 40% of familial ALS and up to 25% of familial FTD (c9FTD/ALS). The pathogenic mechanism of this disease remains unknown. One possibili ty is that the expansion induces C9ORF72 loss of function. In support of this, methylation of C9ORF72 promoter DNA has been reported in association with decreased gene expression. However, the relationship between expan sion size, gene expression, and promoter methylation remains unclear. Materials and Methods: Fibroblasts from c9FTD/ALS patients were cul tured and analysed for hexanucleotide repeat size by Southern blotting. C9ORF72 gene expression was determined by qRT PCR and digital droplet PCR. The degree of promoter DNA methylation was assayed by methyl DNA immunoprecipitation with qPCR. The expression of wild type mouse C9ORF72 orthologue was also assayed by qRT PCR across ages from birth to 1 year. Results: C9ORF72 expansion size in fibroblasts did not correlate with either gene expression or promoter methylation. Surprisingly, there was a positive correlation between degree of methylation and levels of C9ORF72 expressi on. Of the three described C9ORF72 mRNA transcripts, one predominates that uses a first exon downstream of the expansion. In mice, brain expres sion of the C9ORF72 orthologue was found to be significantly higher in the neonatal period. Conclusions: This study demonstrates a wide variability in C9ORF72 gene expression and promoter DNA methylation among patient cell lines carrying pathogenic hexanucleotide expansions. The high levels of expression in neo natal mice suggests a role in neurological development. This work was funded by a Wellcome Trust Clinical DPhil Fellowship awar ded to AGLD.",2015
23634,"The GGGGCC expansion in the intronic/promoter region of C9orf72 was first described in October 2011 and is the most common monogenic cause of Frontotemporal Dementia and/or Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (FTD/ALS). Non pathogenic alleles are typically 2 20 repeats, and pathogenic ex pansions typically several hundred to several thousand repeats in length, with considerable somatic mosaicism. The smallest pathogenic repeat size is currently unknown. We have offered a diagnostic service for the expansi on at the National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery since January 2013. We employ repeat primed and sizing PCRs to detect expansions and to size alleles in the non pathogenic range, respectively. Southern blotting is used to confirm and size expansions and to exclude false negatives in pati ents who are homozygous with no expansion by PCR. Of 242 reports issued up to February 2015, 240 were diagnostic, with 2 predictive. Of the diagno stic tests, 27 were positive (11.25%), this is concordant with the published frequency of the expansion in FTD/ALS. Among our positive results 24 had a typical expansion. We have also identified one apparent homozygote, one patient with an expansion of 90 repeats in blood which had expanded to the typical pathogenic range in brain tissue, and one patient with a repeat from 60 to several thousand repeats in blood DNA.

Exome sequencing was applied to search for variants at the loci. Results: The affected sib had ataxia, intellectual disability, and aggressive beha viour. The maximum multipoint LOD score was 2.15.

The sequence of the first 736 of the total 765 amino acids is highly conserved between human and chimpanzee, with a difference of only 5. The function of the protein is yet unknown,unknown and it is shown to be expressed in many different tissues. The conserved domain has homology to retinoic acid induced proteins. One gene encoding such a protein Retinoic acid induced 1 (RAI1) is associated with several neurological diseases. GeneMANIA suggests that FAM160B1 interacts with ATXN1, deficit of which is a cause of spinocerebellar ataxia.

CHCHD10 encodes a protein located in the mitochon drial intermembrane space and is likely involved in mitochondrial genome stability and maintenance of cristae junctions. Given the unawareness about the exact contribution of CHCHD10 in FTD ALS spectrum, we evaluated, in this study, the frequency of CHCHD10 mutations in a large French cohort of 115 unrelated patients with FTD and FTD ALS phenotypes, including 35 familial and 80 sporadic cases. We identified 2 heterozygous variants in 3 unrelated probands presenting FTD and ALS : the known p. Ser59Leu muta tion in a familial case and the p. Pro34Ser variant in two sporadic cases. The phenotype of this probands is characterized by early and predominant bul bar symptoms. A short time ago, many studies confirmed the involvement of CHCHD10 in familial and sporadic ALS cases. However, this is the only study that demonstrates the implication of CHCHD10 in FTD ALS spectrum. Alt hough the frequency of mutations is low in this series (2.6%), our work sug gests that CHCHD10 mutations should be searched particularly in presence of bulbar symptoms at onset, or evocative mitochondrial symptoms.

The LRSAM1 gene has recently been implicated in the CMT pathogenesis and very little is currently known about its role. LRSAM1 is an E3 ubiquitin ligase that has a significant role in endocytic and adhesion pathways in neuronal cells and mediates monoubiquitination of TSG101 at multiple sites. This study is focused on the functional analysis of the novel LRSAM1 c.2047 1G>A dominant splice site point mutation. This mutation is located in the C terminal RING finger domain of the encoded protein and leads to premature truncation (p. Ala683ProfsX3).Materials and methods: Total RNA was extracted from available patient lym phoblastoid cell lines and the whole cDNA was synthesized. Initially, RNA levels of TSG101, the only known substrate of LRSAM1 E3 ubiquitin ligase activity, were investigated. Moreover, the RNA levels of E2 (ubiquitin) and additional molecules were examined. Selected molecules that possibly in teract with LRSAM1 were detected using public protein protein interaction databases. Results: RNA levels of TSG101 and E2 were significantly reduced in patient compared to control levels. Furthermore, a statistically significant reduction of the levels of some of the selected molecules was observed. Western blot analysis to confirm the decrease of these molecules at the protein level is currently underway.

23639,"Array CGH analysis has shown that rare or common Copy Number Variants, both inherited and de novo, may significantly contribute to the etiology of neurodevelopmental disorders. A recurrent genomic aberrations asso ciated with these phenotypes is the duplication of chromosome 15q11.2. Characterizing a cohort of 180 families using the Agilent 180K CGH array platform, we identified 4 patients carrying a 15q11.2 duplication involving the 4 genes TUBGCP5, CYFIP1, NIPA2 and NIPA1. Two were inherited from the healthy mother, one from an affected mother and one had an unknown parental origin. The duplication was confirmed by qPCR and a significant overexpression of the four duplicated genes was found using quantitative gene expression analysis. Two patients were diagnosed with Autism Spec trum Disorder, one with Developmental Delay and one is non verbal and has a severe Intellectual Disability (the latter patient carries an additional pathogenic imbalance on the X chromosome). Strong evidence supports the role of this duplication in abnormal neurodevelopment. These four genes are all implicated in axonal growth, neuronal connectivity and morphology, especially CYFIP1 which regulates translation at the synapse by binding to FMRP . Phenotypically normal and mildly affected carriers complicate the phenotypic association and/or causality of this aberration. The explanation of this variability may be found in the reduced penetrance or altered gene dosage on a particular genetic background.

All results were compared to human brain reference RNA and statistically evaluated for significant expression differences. Results: MEG3 and RNCR3 were strongly down regulated in all sample groups, especially in CJD samples. FENDRR was up regulated in all non CJD and WND samples, and either down or up regulated in CJD samples. Stati stical analyses showed significant over or under expression when we cross compared expression of CJD, non CJD and WND patients. Moreover, signi ficant expression differences were also observed between FL and C region within sample group. Conclusions: Our findings support lncRNAÃ¢ÂÂs FENDRR , MEG3 and RNCR3 in volvement in development of the prion disease and other neurodegenera tive disorders, like AlzheimerÃ¢ÂÂs, and suggest they are necessary for normal brain function. Moreover, our results showed different spatial (cerebellum and frontal lobe) distribution that may contribute to the disease develop ment.",2015
23643,"Patients with schizophrenia (SCZ) suffer from a variety of symptoms, in cluding delusions, hallucinations, disorganized speech and behavior. Even though studies have reported a reduced fecundity in patients with SCZ, the incidence rate of SCZ remains fairly stable. One hypothesis is that the muta tions that are selected out of the gene pool due to strong negative selection are replaced by de novo mutations. Therefore, each gene identified to carry a de novo mutation is a potential SCZ candidate gene. The exomes of 40 patients with a DSM IV diagnosis of SCZ and their parents were analyzed. Exome DNA was captured from genomic DNA using Nimble Gen in solution based capture and sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq 2000 sequencing instrument. The Varbank pipeline v.2.1 and interface were used for data analysis and filtering. Subsequently, additional sources of genetic data were employed to gather more evidence for an involvement of the genes implicated: the genes were screened for the presence of CNVs using our existing genome wide CNV da taset comprising of 1 637 patients and 1 627 controls. An association bet ween common variants in these genes and SCZ was tested in the worldwide largest SCZ GWAS published by the PGC Schizophrenia Working Group ana lyzing more than 100 000 individuals. So far, we have validated 28 different variants using Sanger Sequencing. In terestingly, our study is the third to report a de novo mutation in SEC31A. The combination of our exome sequncing and CNV data as well as the com mon variants will allow us to prioritize the variants identified regarding their relevance for the development of SCZ.",2015
23644,"The increasing availability and affordability of whole exome sequencing is challenging the current testing algorithms typically including detailed fami ly history and clinical characteristics, predicting a decrease for the need of probabilistic prioritisation of genetic testing. To evaluate this prediction, we have assessed a cohort of 65 patients referred for frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and compared the diagnostic yield of the initial referrals for single gene tests vs. a 16 gene dementia panel test using our clinical exome se quencing pipeline. This 16 gene panel includes mostly autosomal dominant rare Mendelian early onset Alzheimer and FTD genes, that despite being clinically different show a degree of phenotypic overlap justifying the use of a panel. Although this approach has the clear potential to increase the diagnostic rate, we also aimed to determine its usefulness vs. the burden of finding variants of unknown clinical significance (VUS). Analysis showed a diagno stic rate of 6/65 for the initial targeted referrals with 4/65 VUS. Subsequent interpretation of panel data increased this rate to 7/65 for published patho genic variants and added 19 variants which we are currently assessing for pathogenicity, including 3 PSEN2 variants reported in the AD&FTD databa se. Preliminary results on this small FTD cohort indicate that despite the complexity of the interpretation of gene panel data, the increase in diagno stic rate together with value for money should encourage clinicians to refer for gene panels.",2015
23645,"Cross sectional studies report an association between increased serum in terleukin 6 (IL 6), an inflammatory marker, and depression. However, due to the nature of cross sectional data, confounding and reverse causality can not be ruled out as explanations for this observed association. A recent study using data from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) attempted to unpick this issue by investigating the asso ciation between levels of IL 6 at age 9 and depressive symptoms at age 18 (Khandaker et al., JAMA Psychiatry. 2014). This study found evidence of an association between increased IL 6 at age 9 and greater depressive sym ptoms at 18 (adjusted ÃÂ²,0.06, se,0.03)).We expanded on this study using Mendelian randomisation (MR), an ap proach largely free from issues such as confounding and reverse causality.

23646,"DiGeorge syndrome (DGS, OMIM 188400) is one of the most common chro mosomal disorders, with an estimated prevalence of 1 in 4 000 6 000 live births. It is actually a well defined primary immunodeficiency disorder classically associated with abnormal facial appearance, congenital heart de fects, hypoparathyroidism with hypocalcaemia, as well as cognitive, beha vioral and psychiatric problems. Pathological hallmarks include conotrun cal abnormalities and absence or hypoplasia of the thymus and parathyroid glands. The facial appearance of patients with DGS is characterized by hy pertelorism, micrognathia, short philtrum with fish mouth appearance, an timongoloid slant, and telecanthus with short palpebral fissures. However, not all patients with DGS show these typical dysmorphic findings and the diagnosis can be delayed for many years. It has been reported that children and adults with DGS have high rates of behavioral, psychiatric and commu nication disorders. Here, we report the case of a patient that was 11 year old boy born to unrelated healthy parents. Initially, he was admitted to the Neuropaediatric Department by seizures, attention deficit and socialization problems. The brain computed tomography CT revealed calcification loca ted in the left basal ganglia. The EEG was abnormal due to generalized inter mittent slow waves without any epileptiform discharges. Genetic analysis by MLPA technique (P245 MCR Holland) showed a microdetion in 22q11 affecting to GP1BB, CLDN5 and SNAP29 probes, associated to a DiGeorge Syndrome. Clinical absence of the typical hallmarks of this syndrome should not exclude this disease due to variable phenotypes. Continuous efforts to define diverse clinical manifestations of this syndrome will lead to proper evaluation and intervention for patients.",2015
23647,"Introduction: Genome wide levels of association between bipolar disorder (BPD) and schizophrenia (SZ) have been reported with the CACNA1C gene. This gene encodes the pore forming unit of L type voltage gated calcium channels. The associated SNPs are located in a cluster in intron 3, however the functional effects of the associated SNPs remain to be determined. In this study we investigated if DNA methylation of CACNA1C in blood differed between BPD patients compared to healthy control subjects. Material and methods: DNA methylation status of five CpG islands (CGIs) in the CACNA1C gene was investigated using Sequenom EpiTYPER in 630 bipolar disorder patients and 340 control subjects. Results: Four out of five CACNA1C CGI islands were either fully methylated or fully unmethylated. In contrast one CGI showed intermediate methylation levels with substantial intra individual variation. Follow up analysis of this CGI identified a significant difference in DNA methylation levels between the BPD cases and healthy controls. Furthermore the methylation status of this CGI was highly correlated with the genotypes of the BPD and SZ risk SNPs. Conclusion: The functional effects of the CACNA1C GWAS risk alleles may be mediated through changes in methylation status of intron 3.",2015
23648,"Dyggve Melchior Clausen syndrome (DMC, MIM #223800) is a rare inheri ted dwarfism characterized by spondyloepimetaphyseal dysplasia, postna tal microcephaly and intellectual disability, and caused by loss of function mutations in the DYM gene encoding DYMECLIN, a Golgi associated protein involved in intracellular trafficking. Interestingly, both skeletal growth de fects and microcephaly develop during childhood and are therefore rarely diagnosed at birth. This suggests that the physiological mechanisms affec ted in DMC involve postnatal processes. We used Dymeclin mutant mice to determine the cause of microcephaly and to identify defective mechanisms at the cellular level. Brain weight and volume were reduced in all mutant mice from postnatal day 5 onward. Mutant mice displayed a narrowing of the frontal cortex, although cortical layers were normally organized. Intere stingly, the corpus callosum was markedly thinner, a characteristic we also identified in three unrelated DMC patients carrying the p. Gln483Ter non sense mutation. Consistent with this, the myelin sheath was less compact and not properly rolled, while the number of mature oligodendrocytes and their ability to produce myelin basic protein were significantly decreased. Finally, cortical neurons from mutant mice and primary fibroblasts from DMC patients displayed substantially delayed endoplasmic reticulum to Golgi trafficking, that could be fully rescued upon Dymeclin re expression. These findings indicate that Dymeclin is crucial for proper myelination and anterograde neuronal trafficking, two processes that are highly active du ring postnatal brain maturation.

23649,"Dystonia is a group of clinically heterogeneous neurological disorders cha racterized by involuntary movements and prolonged muscle contraction, which may involve the entire body or only an isolated area. Several genetic forms of dystonia have been identified, but genetic testing has been limited by time consuming and costly procedures. However, using next generation sequencing technology, it is now possible to develop inexpensive tests by which multiple genes can be screened in parallel. We designed a panel including the coding sequences of 17 genes implicated in different forms of dystonia, using a similar method as described previous ly (PihlstrÃÂ¸m L, et al ., Ann of Hum Genet, 2014). We screened these genes in 116 clinically well characterized Norwegian dystonia patients as well as 120 ethnically matched controls. The sequencing yielded high quality data with average 98% bases covered above 80x in the targeted intervals. Our bioinformatics pipeline identified 11 variants for further validation and con firmation. We identified variants in ANO3, CIZ1, GCH1, NKX2 1, PNKD , PRRT2, SGCE, TOR1A , and TH. Out of these, two confirmed variants are truncating changes located in GCH1 and CIZ1. After the ongoing validation analysis, we will be able to establish a molecular diagnosis in a subset of patients. Our approach of gene panel based next generation sequencing will be able to gauge the potential of the method used and will point towards future di rections for targeted screenings in such heterogeneous neurological disor ders.

NGS helps us to improve diagnostics of well known disorders, to detect rare mutations in genetic heterogeneous diseases, and to discover new disease causing genes. Growing number of experiences indicate huge NGS benefits, as well as some method limitations. We describe here results of NGS method implementation in three different single gene/familiar diseases in patients from Serbia. We have analyzed: 1. one family with early onset dystonia parkinsonism, negative for common DYT and PARK mutations, 2. one family with cerebral congenital cavernous malformation, negative for CCM1 gene mutations, 3. one sporadic case of Wilson disease with only one heterozygous ATP7B mutation (H1069Q) de tected by screening of five mutation prone exons.

23651,"Spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs) in patients with an onset age under 30 years (early onset ataxias, EOAs) are mostly caused in autosomal recessive genes and show a wide range of clinical symptoms. Due to the large variability and overlap of phenotype and the rapidly increasing amount of (often very rare) ataxia related genes, it is challenging to find a molecular diagnosis in these patients. The study cohort of 131 cases with EOA was negatively screened for do minant repeat expansion SCAs and FRDA. Patients with a genetic mutation sufficient to explain the ataxia or with neurodegenerative disease in more than one generation were excluded beforehand. Samples were processed with a custom built ataxia specific HaloPlex panel (Agilent) for 132 genes and sequenced on a MiSeq (Illumina) followed by bioinformatics analyses using our in house pipeline. By this approach, on average, >95% of the target region was covered Ã¢ÂÂ¥20x with a mean coverage of 257 ÃÂ± 71 reads.

Early Infantile Epi leptic Encephalopathies (EIEE) are EE with onset before age 3 4 months. Etiologies are heterogeneous and whole exome sequencing (WES) techni ques can help to clarify their etiopathogenesis. Patients&Methods : Patients were retrospectively selected based on their cli nical and electroencephalographic diagnosis of EIEE, registered at the Epi lepsy Clinic of our Tertiary Hospital from 1995 to 2013. Exclusion criteria were: brain injury secondary to hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy, trauma, stroke, infection and intracranial hemorrhage. We performed a descriptive analysis concerning demographics, epileptic phenotype and investigation. Selected patients without diagnosis are under WES analysis using TruSeq capture followed by sequencing on a HiSeq2500. Results: From the 27 selected patients, median age for first manifestation was 45 days [1day 4months]. Six patients had electroclinical syndromes (four Ohtahara syndrome; two early myoclonic encephalopathy). The ma jority had severe DD. Brain MRI of 22 patients was diagnostic in nine (eight had malformation of cortical development, MCD). Six (22%) patients died. Ten patients (37%) had a confirmed molecular diagnosis (six metabolic di seases, three genetic syndromes, one MCD). All were sporadic situations.

23653,"Purpose:We set out to find the genetic cause of focal epilepsy in a family with indi viduals with lesional and non lesional focal epilepsy, as detectable by MRI analysis. The family showed autosomal dominant inheritance and genome wide linkage analysis failed to identify a linkage region. Methods:We carried out exome capture and massively parallel sequencing on two individuals from the family who were affected with focal epilepsy and ana lysed the data using an in house bioinformatics pipeline. Candidate causa tive genetic variants were validated by direct Sanger sequencing and were analysed for co segregation with affected status and assessed for likely pa thogenicity. Results:We identified a mutation in DEPDC5 as being causative of lesional and non lesional focal epilepsy in the family. We then identified DEPDC5 mutations in additional families with mutation positive individuals with lesional and non lesional focal epilepsy. DEPDC5 associated malformations include bot tom of the sulcus dysplasia and focal subcortical band heterotopia. Conclusion:We have found that mutations in DEPDC5 cause familial cases of focal epi lepsy associated with structural brain lesions as well as in cases with no structural brain abnormalities. We have therefore shown that lesional and non lesional epilepsy can have a shared genetic aetiology. This challenges the long held view that lesional and non lesional epilepsy are distinct cli nical entities with different causes. DEPDC5 negatively regulates the mTOR pathway which plays a key role in cell growth and metabolism. The clinical and radiological phenotypes associated with DEPDC5 mutations share fea tures with the archetypal mTORopathy, tuberous sclerosis, raising the pos sibility of new therapeutic avenues for patients.",2015
23654,"Epilepsy is a neurological disorder that affects about 3% of the population and is characterized by sudden and violent seizures (focal or generalized). Different causes have been associated with epileptic disorders (brain injury, ABSTRACTS POSTERS ESHG 2015 | GLASGOW, SCOTLAND, UK | WWW. ESHG. ORG 177Back to inde x stroke or brain damage at the time of birth) and in recent years, several ge nes mutations have been implicated in this complex disorder. However the mechanisms that connect many of the identified mutations/genes to epi lepsy are still unknown. We focused our attention on the hnRNPU gene in which two different loss of function de novo mutations (chr1:245019921 CATTTGTCTTT/C INDEL; chr1:243086781 C>T) have been identified in two different patients affec ted by epileptic encephalopathy. hnRNPU has an important role in mRNA processing, transcription and splicing. To better understand the neurobio logical role of hnRNPU in epilepsy we used a Micro electode array (MEA) platform that is able to record the field potential of electrically active cells from 768 electrodes simultaneously. We plated wild type mouse cortical neurons on MEA plates and used the shRNA to knock down hnRNPU gene in a half of the tested cells. Next, we constructed a tool to analyze the complex multi dimensional output of the MEA recordings. This enabled us to observe a general effect of decreased expression on neuronal activity of treated neu rons. Preliminary results specifically show that the hnRNPU knock down re sults in characteristic changes in neuronal activity, where treated cells have prolonged bursts activity with increased firing rate compared to the wild, revealing a neuronal phenotype activity that can be compared with what is observed in vivo in epileptic seizures.

23655,"Microelectrode arrays (MEAs) are powerful tools for detecting spontaneous neuronal activity. MEAs have been used to detect the response of primary dissociated neurons to neurotoxins and are emerging as reliable drug scree ning platforms. Recent studies indicating the involvement of microRNAs in epilepsy phenotypes encouraged us to investigate the effect of modulating microRNA 128, on neuronal activity. Mice deficient in microRNA 128 are prone to fatal seizures. Modulating microRNA 128 in the MEA system allo wed us to directly test whether MEAs are useful to screen other microRNAs that influence risk of seizures. In particular, we sought to evaluate whether down regulation of microRNA 128 results in clear excitability phenotypes by MEA analysis. We used primary cortical neurons from wild type post natal day zero C57BL6 mice and a lentivirus delivered microRNA sponge to target the mature microRNA 128. Sponges are competitive microRNA inhi bitors which express tandem repeats that are partially complementary to the microRNA sequence. We recorded neuronal activity on the MEA for 15 minutes each day to collect spike, burst, and network synchronicity data. Our data show that down regulation of microRNA 128 by inhibition with a sponge results in significantly increased neuronal activity. These features are consistent with the previous observations that microRNA 128 deficien cy promotes neuronal excitability. These experiments illustrate the utility of the MEA platform in evaluation of microRNAs in regulation of network phenotypes.",2015
23656,"We have studied a cohort of 352 patients suffering from early onset epi leptic encephalopathy. This cohort was studied either in a diagnostic or in a research setting. All patients had epilepsy beginning before 3 months of age, abnormal interictal EEG, no brain abnormality and a normal metabo lic screening. They all had abnormal neurological development. Globally, among the 352 patients, we identified 75 probably damaging mutations (21,3%). As a first step, all patients were screened for mutations in the KCNQ2 or STXBP1 genes. We identified 33 mutations in KCNQ2 (9,3% of the cohort) and 19 mutations in STXBP1 (5,4% of the cohort). If we consider the diagnostic cohort only (189 patients) the yield is 17,4% for KCNQ2 and 10% for STXBP1 mutations.

23657,"Aim: In recent studies of mutations underlying epileptic encephalopathies, numerous genes have been identified with unsufficient statistical support. We sought to increase support for at least some of those genes. Methods: samples from 362 patients with epileptic encephalopathy were tested on a panel of 370 known and candidate genes. Thirty eight patients had similarly affected sibs, 37 sporadics had consanguineous parents, 287 sporadics had no known parental relatedness. The genes had been collec ted from literature and earlier experiments in our labs. Eighteen genes had OMIM annotations for epileptic encephalopathy; 66 genes were expected to be recessive, 288 dominant, 13 X linked, the remainder unknown. In the first screen, no parents were included. We looked for novel coding variants. Results: Thirty eight patients had probably pathogenic variants in OMIM annotated genes. One inbred patient was homozygous for a recessive can didate gene, four sporadic patients were compound heterozygous for reces sive candidate genes. Some genes, e.g. NFASC, had more novel hits than ex pected from its length, while some genes with a known connection to severe epilepsies were NOT overrepresented relative to gene size . Of the genes with excess novel hits COL7A1 and FREM2 are known causes for the recessive diseases Epidermolysis bullosa and Fraser syndrome respectively. Conclusions: Despite a likely enrichment for recessive forms of epileptic encephalopathy, through inclusion of multiplex and inbred families, very few patients had homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations in re cessive candidate genes, suggesting that recessive epileptic encephalopathi es are very rare. Sequencing of our patientsÃ¢ÂÂ parents and further analysis will sort out new EE genes.",2015
23658,"Introduction: Primary Familial Brain Calcification (PFBC) also known as FahrÃ¢ÂÂs disease is a rare genetic disorder including heterogeneous and pro gressive neurologic dysfunction, caused mainly by calcification in basal gan glia. Thus far, 3 genes have been identified to be involved in FahrÃ¢ÂÂs disease, SLC20A2, PDGFRB and PDGFB. Recent evidence suggests that SLC20A2 might be associated with Paroxysmal Kinesigenic Dyskinesia (PKD).Materials and methods: We performed a SLC20A2, PDGFRB and PDGFB gene analysis of 4 families with FahrÃ¢ÂÂs disease and a SLC20A2 screening of a PKD family. The genomic DNA was extracted, genes amplified and then sequenced. Results: Screening for SLC20A2 detected a novel missense mutation c.1618G>A in heterozygous form in two affected members of a PFBC fami ly. This mutation leads to a Gly540Arg substitution in a highly conserved residue in transmembrane domain IX. A novel SLC20A2 deletion in hetero zygous state c.21_21delG (p. Leu7Fs*10) was found in a patient of a second PFBC family. Conclusion: As predicted the first mutation causes a loss of function of the protein while deletion causes a frameshift generating a truncated protein.

Introduction: Early and late onset forms of familial amyloid polyneuropa thy (FAP) ATTR V30M (aka Val50Met) are not separate entities: they may coexist in the same family, with offspring often showing anticipation of age of onset (AO). Our aim was to identify modifiers closely linked to the TTR locus that may in part explain the wide variability in AO. Methods: Eight variants at the TTR locus were analysed, in a sample of 722 individuals (588 V30M carriers). An intensive in silico analysis was perfor med to study a possible regulation of gene expression. Results: Haplotype A was the most common in our population. Noteworthy, haplotype C was more frequent in early onset carriers than in late patients (p,0.012). When we compared allelic frequencies of each SNP of haploty pe C between very early (Ã¢ÂÂ¤30yrs) and late onset cases (Ã¢ÂÂ¥50yrs), we found a significant association of the A allele of rs72922947 with early onset (p,0.009), which remained significant after a permutation based correc tion. Also, the GA genotype was associated with a decrease in mean AO of 8.6 yrs (p,0.014).We also found interesting, unreported results in the in silico analysis. Sever al alterations in the mechanism of splicing, transcription factors binding and miRNAs binding were observed. Conclusions: We found a common haplotype linked with V30M mutation and, importantly, a possible modulatory effect on AO by a genetic variant present in the normal chromosome. These putative mechanisms of regulati on of gene expression, within the TTR gene, could be potential therapeutical targets.",2015
23660,"Friedreich ataxia (FRDA, MIM 229300) is an autosomal recessive form of ataxia, caused by mutations in the FXN gene (MIM 606829), localized at 9q21.11.

However, about 2% of the FRDA patients are compound heterozygous for the expansion and a point mutation in the FXN gene. Limb Girdle Muscular Dystrophy Type 2A (LGMD2A, MIM 253600; Cal painopathy) is another autosomal recessive neuromuscular disorder pre sented with progressive proximal (limb girdle) muscle weakness. LGM D2A is caused by mutations in the CAPN3 gene (MIM 114240) localized at 15q15.1.

Up to 40% of FTD patients report family members with FTD supporting the important contribution of genetic factors. Seven genes are linked to FTD, with the most prevalent mutations located in PGRN, MAPT and C9ORF72. Materials and Methods The study group comprised 138 FTD patients (mean age of onset 56,3ÃÂ±11,8; 57 patients with familial FTD) and control group consisted of 257 neurolo gically healthy persons. MAPT and PGRN were direct sequenced. Hexanu cleotide repeat expansion located in C9ORF72 was analyzed using repeatÃ¢ÂÂ primed PCR. Results In the group of FTD patients fifteen putative pathogenic mutations (six in MAPT, four in PGRN, and five in C9ORF72) were identified including three novel mutation: MAPT G55R, PGRN D317fsX11, and PGRN P439_R440fsX6. Mutation in three analyzed genes are responsible for 11% of all analyzed FTD cases and 31% of familial cases. ConclusionsAlthough the mutations in the analyzed genes are responsible for a signi ficant percentage of FTD cases from the Polish population, it is recommen ded to apply new generation sequencing methods (NGS) to detect mutations in the remainder FTD cases.",2015
23663,"Introduction: Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) is the second most common form of presenile dementia characterized by progressive behavioral and/or language disorders. Mutations in progranulin (GRN, autosomal dominant inheritance), are causative for this disease in 5 10 percent of cases, leading to reduced levels of progranulin protein levels due to haploinsufficiency. Upcoming therapeutic trials focus on enhancing progranulin production. To be able to correctly interpret effects of these agents, knowledge of natural variability and correlations between progranulin levels in blood and cere brospinal fluid are essential. Methods: We studied the variability of progranulin levels in 42 subjects (4 FTD patients with GRN mutation, 19 presymptomatic GRN carriers and 19 healthy controls). We performed lumbar punctures in 28 subjects (3 FTD patients with GRN mutation, 16 presymptomatic GRN carriers and 9 healthy controls).Results: Progranulin levels are significantly lower in GRN carriers compared to healthy controls (mean 7866 pg/mL versus 27473 pg/mL, p,0.00). Pro granulin levels in plasma are remarkably stable over time (mean variability per subject is 11%). Presymptomatic versus symptomatic carriers show equal median progranulin levels and variability (p,0.29 resp. p,0.26). In CSF, progranulin levels are also significantly lower in carriers (median 334 pg/mL) compared to controls (median 761 pg/mL, p,0.00). Plasma progra nulin levels show a good correlation with CSF progranulin levels in the total cohort (SpearmanÃ¢ÂÂs rho,0.82, p,0.00). Conclusions: Peripheral progranulin levels are stable and correlate well with central levels, therefore plasma progranulin levels are a promising bio marker for subjects with GRN mutations.

Introduction: Hemiplegic migraine (HM) is a rare subtype of migraine with aura. Typical HM attacks are characterized by fully reversible motor wea kness that is associated with visual, sensory or speech symptoms. Further more, attacks may occur with basilar type symptoms, prolonged hemiple gia, confusion, coma, fever or seizures. To date several mutations have been identified for HM locating in three ion transporter genes: CACNA1A, ATP1A2 and SCN1A . Materials and Methods: In order to study the involvement of the three HM genes in the Finnish HM patients we have exome sequenced (Agilent/Illumi na: Sanger Institute) 303 patients from 252 families fulfilling the criteria for HM. The mean sequence depth of the target exome was 86. The minor allele frequencies of exonic variants were checked against The Exome Aggregation Consortium (ExAC) and 1000G project data. Validation and segregation ana lyses of all novel and rare exonic and splice site variants are ongoing. Results: Exome sequencing analyses revealed 43 potentially functional, unknown, low or rare frequency variants in the three FHM genes. One of the identified variants was the well known mutation p. Thr666Met in CACNA1A . The variant was found in one family segregating perfectly. Conclusions: Most of the so far studied variants do not seem to segregate with the HM phenotype. Hence, after validation and segregation analyses we will study whether different variant composition including e.g. several less deleterious variants, could predispose to HM susceptibility. In addition, the exome data will be screened genome wide to identify whether variants in other genes could contribute to HM.",2015

The hereditary spastic paraplegias (HSPs) are a clinically and genetically heterogeneous group of degenerative motor neuron disorders in which the cardinal clinical feature is progressive lower limb spasticity. This feature may occur in isolation (Ã¢ÂÂpureÃ¢ÂÂ HSP), or be accompanied by other neurological or non neurological clinical features (Ã¢ÂÂcomplicatedÃ¢ÂÂ HSP). We investigated the genetic basis of disease in two unrelated families, one with pure HSP , and the second with a complicated HSP associated with optic atrophy and neu ropathy. Genome wide SNP mapping in both families identified a single no table region of homozygosity peculiar to affected family members on chro mosome 3q12.2, indicating that the disease gene was likely located in this region in each family. Exome sequencing in an affected individual from the pure HSP family identified a homozygous missense mutation (p. Arg106His) within the TFG gene, located within the mapped region. Subsequent analysis of the TFG gene in the complicated HSP family revealed another sequence alteration, again affecting arginine 106, although this time resulting in its substitution with cysteine (p. Arg106Cys). Thus both sequence alterations result in the substitution of the highly conserved arginine 106 residue with two different amino acids with distinct chemical properties, indicating that the clinical severity of disease may relate to the differing chemical proper ties of the substituted amino acid. Taken together, our findings confirm a causative role of TFG mutation in HSP and identify residue arginine 106 of TFG as a mutation hotspot to be considered for diagnostic screening in both pure HSP as well as complicated forms of HSP .

In these 98 families we identified the responsible gene in 22, resulting in a frequency of 22,5%. This low frequency could be explained by the fact that these families were the ones remaining after the exclusion of the most frequent HSP genes. Variants with unexpected inheritance modes and phe notypes were found in known genes. Our results show the importance of testing families with all modes of inheritance for the same set of genes and also, the importance of testing genes causing overlapping phenotypes.

In a recent study of our Bradford population, 28% of babies were born to consanguineous parents (18% were born to parents who were first cousins). In consanguineous families there is a risk that individuals with HD may be homozygous for the disease causing CAG expansion. Homozygous expansions do not significantly alter the clinical phenotype in HD, but if detected on genetic testing this would significantly affect the offspring risk (which would be 100% for developing HD rather than the 50% expected fol lowing autosomal dominant inheritance). A homozygous result would also confirm that both parents of the proband are at risk of HD, when perhaps only one parent is aware of their diagnosis. We present examples of consanguineous families where at least one indivi dual has been diagnosed with HD.

We have reviewed the data of individuals tested over the last 10 years and noted an increase in the number of people diagnosed with HD in the absence of a known or assumed family history of the condition. In our experience, these families present different counselling challenges to those encountered in families already known to be affected by HD. For example, adult children of a person diagnosed with HD in later life may perceive HD as a benign condition affecting only older people, even when genetic anticipation has been explained. When a new diagnosis is made in an older adult, not only has the tested individual completed their family, but often their own offspring are in the midst of child bearing or have comple ted their families too.

Background: Ischemic stroke is a major cause of death and disability in the world. A major ischemic stroke subtype (large artery atherosclerosis [LAA]) has been suggested to have some genetic components in individuals of Eu ropean ancestry. However, whether genetic predisposition to LAA varies by ethnicity remains unknown.

We replicated the study in an independent Han Chinese population comprising an additional 319 cases and 1,802 controls.

Indirect genetic analyzes showed a transmission profile for the mutant MLC1 gene. Patients and methods: It is about two Tunisian consanguineous families. The first family shows a girl and a boy with ma crocephaly, seizures, ataxia and MRI confirmation. The second family has four daughters; of which, one had clinical and radiological signs for MLC.

23682,"Interstitial 2p15 p16.1 microdeletion is a rare microdeletion syndrome pre viously reported in 14 patients. It is characterized by moderate to severe in tellectual disability, autism spectrum disorder, microcephaly, short stature, dysmorphic features, structural brain anomalies and multiple congenital or gans defects. It is considered a contiguous gene syndrome involving deletion of several genes. Deletions previously reported are variable in size (from 203 kb to 6.9 Mb) and have non recurrent breakpoints. We report here three additional patients carried a 2p15 p16.1 microdeletion shown by SNP array analysis (Cyto12 SNP , Illumina) : a prenatal case and two postnatal cases. The prenatal and one of the postnatal cases share an overlapping 2p15p16.1 deletion of 105 kb including only XPO1 and the distal end of USP34. Both pa tients presented features overlapping the clinical spectrum of the 2p15p16 microdeletion syndrome including dysmorphic facial features and brain structural abnormalities. We confirm that one or both genes are probab ly involved in facial dysmorphic features, cognitive impairment and brain structural abnormalities observed in 2p15p16.1 deletion syndrome. The third patient we reported on is a 4 years old male with an heterozygous de novo a 427 kb deletion at 2p16.1 (chr2:60624940 61051867) containing BCL11A and PAPOLG and a phenotype characterized by speech delay, auti stic traits and stereotyped behavior but without microcephaly. Considering previous deletions in the 2p15p16.1 region and our three new cases, we precise the genotype phenotype correlation of the microdeletion syndrome. Moreover we suggest that the REL gene could be considered as a candidate gene for microcephaly. ABSTRACTS POSTERS ESHG 2015 | GLASGOW, SCOTLAND, UK | WWW. ESHG. ORG 184Back to inde x",2015
23683,"Primary microcephaly (PM) is a rare and heterogeneous group of affections characterized by a reduction in brain volume and intellectual disability. In some circumstances, PM is also associated with primordial dwarfisms (mi crocephalic primordial dwarfisms, such as Seckel, MOPD2 and Meyer Gorlin syndromes). Interestingly, all microcephalic primordial dwarfisms reported to date are recessively inherited and genes identified so far encode centro somal proteins. However, they account for less than half of cases in Europe, indicating that other genes remain to be identified. Here, we report on a new form of microcephalic primordial dwarfism with an autosomal dominant inheritance, in which no known PM gene was found to be mutated. The father (25 years old) and his daughter (3 years old) shared common features in their medical history: Intrauterine growth retardation followed by postnatal growth failure (length 4 SD), microcephaly ( 5 SD), and dys morphic features including microretrognathia, hypotelorism, shortening of fore arms and legs and muscular hypertrophy. In addition, the father had a micropenis, a hypoplasia of the scrotum and developed an early onset ca taract at the age of 7. The daughter had a cleft palate, and feeding difficulties that needed nutritional support until the age of 2. Her cranial MRI showed isolated microcephaly. This case report enlarges the frontiers of microcephalic primordial dwar fism to dominant forms that are likely linked to impairments of new specific PM genes.

23684,"As a product of the unique evolution of the human brain, human cognitive performance is largely a collection of heritable traits. Rather surprisingly, to date there have been no reported cases to highlight genes that under went adaptive evolution in humans and which carry polymorphisms that have a marked effect on cognitive performance. IQ motif containing GTPase activating protein 1 (IQGAP1), a scaffold protein, affects learning and me mory in a dose dependent manner. Its expression is regulated by miR 124 through the binding sites in the 3Ã¢ÂÂUTR, where a SNP (rs1042538) exists in the core binding motif. Here we showed that this SNP can influence the miR target interaction both in vitro and in vivo. Individuals carrying the de rived T alleles have higher IQGAP1 expression in the brain as compared to the ancestral A allele carriers. We observed a significant and male specific association between rs1042538 and tactile performances in two indepen dent cohorts. Males with the derived allele displayed higher tactual perfor mances as compared to those with the ancestral allele. Furthermore, we found a highly diverged allele frequency distribution of rs1042538 among world human populations, likely caused by natural selection and/or recent population expansion. These results suggest that current human populati ons still carry sequence variations that affect cognitive performances and that these genetic variants may likely have been subject to comparatively recent natural selection.",2015
23685,"Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune disease of the central nervous system caused by a complex interaction between multiple genes and envi ronmental factors. We report on the incidental observation of two variants in the NR3C2 gene, involved in type 1 pseudohypoaldosteronism (PHA), in young MS patients and investigated whether NR3C2 might be a susceptibili ty gene for MS and autoimmune disease. Case 1 is a male 12 years old MS patient harboring a 112 181 kb deletion in NR3C2. He had no symptoms of PHA but serial blood investigations confir med a mild elevation of aldosterone. Segregation analysis revealed that his mother and maternal aunt, both of which developed autoimmune thyroidi tis, carried the same microdeletion. Case 2 is the mother of a child with PHA. She presented at age 28 with MS and was known to carry the same NR3C2 splice site mutation (c.1757+1G>C) as her daughter. The mother had elevated aldosterone levels. In an independent cohort of 100 MS probands, NR3C2 sequencing detected a loss of function mutation (p. Ser585X) in a single patient with early onset MS and a positive familial history. She had no symptoms of PHA but a mild reproducible elevation of aldosterone. Our data suggest that NR3C2 loss of function variants may associate with a predisposition for developing autoimmune disease, particularly for MS. Though further validation of our findings in a larger cohort is necessary, the involvement of the renin angiotensin aldosterone system in the pathogene sis of MS may have important implications in counseling and management of patients with NR3C2 mutations and opens novel perspectives for MS treatment.",2015
23686,"Genome wide association studies and subsequent fine mapping have iden tified a number of loci containing genetic variants associated with suscep tibility to multiple sclerosis (MS), including the THEMIS/PTPRK locus on chromosome 6q. At this locus, associated SNPs are predominantly interge nic, suggesting that they may have a role in the regulation of gene expressi on. Both THEMIS and PTPRK are indispensable for the thymic production of CD4+ T cells, a process known to be defective in MS. The aim of this study was to investigate the functional mechanisms underlying SNP rs13204742, identified in the fine mapping Immunochip study as being the most signi ficantly associated SNP at the THEMIS/PTPRK locus. PBMCs were isolated from 73 genotyped, healthy individuals, obtaining near equivalent numbers from each genotype at SNP rs13204742. The bio logical significance of this variant was investigated by studying genotypic effects on both total and isoform specific expression of THEMIS, PTPRK and RP11 103C16.2 (an antisense gene to PTPRK), in ex vivo and stimulated CD4+ and CD8+ T cells by quantitative PCR. Genotypic effects on thymic ac tivity were determined by measuring sjTRECs and circulating CD4+ recent thymic emigrants (CD4+CD45RA+CCR7+CD31+ T cells).In ex vivo CD4+ T cells, there was a significant decrease in THEMIS first exon usage with an increasing genetic load of the risk allele at SNP rs13204742 (p,0.0055, ANOVA). This difference was absent upon T cell stimulation. Al ternative first exon usage is a mode of regulating gene expression in a cell specific manner. Therefore our findings suggest that SNP rs13204742 may influence the risk of developing MS by affecting CD4+ T cell specific THEMIS expression.",2015

Despite advances in the research of novel therapies for PKAN, validated international disease rating scales (DRS) to be used in clinical trials are lacking. We aim to identify and genetically characterize the Spanish population with NBIA and to design and validate a quantitative method for clinical assessment of PKAN patients within a cross sectional multi center project. To date 43 NBIA patients from 20 Spanish hospitals have been recruited and assessed according to a new DRS for PKAN (PKAN DRS) and genetic testing of the most frequent genes (PANK2, PLA2G6 and C19orf12) involved in NBIAs have been performed. Twenty three patients have been diagnosed as PKAN and 11 patients carry mutations in the PLA2G6 gene. Moreover, 13 PKAN patients (median age 33 years) have been evaluated according to the PKAN DRS (range 29 71). It is striking that the six Gypsy patients included in this research harbor the PANK2 p. T528 mutation in homozygosis which suggest a founder effect in our population, and present with lower PKAN DRS scores for all subscales when compared with the group of patients with other mutations. This cross sectional multi center has helped us to improve the diagnosis of NBIA patients.

Ten genes have been identified so far, but limited information exists regarding expression and function of these genes within the human brain. To address possible relationships bet ween known NBIA genes, predict their functions, and identify overlapping pathways, we used a systems biology approach based on whole transcrip tome gene expression analysis. As part of the UK Human Brain Expression Consortium (UKBEC), we analysed the expression profiles of 101 neuropa thologically normal individuals (10 distinct brain regions each). Weighted gene co expression network analysis (WGCNA) was used to cluster genes into co expression modules. The overrepresentation of NBIA transcripts in basal ganglia modules (substantia nigra and putamen hereby studied) was assessed.

Aim: The identification of the phenotype and genotype correlation of Hun garian NBIA patients in order to understand the dysfunction of proteins which are associated with NBIA and to collect genetic epidemiology data of the Hungarian NBIA patients. Patients and Methods: We examined 20 patients having different extrapy ramidal signs and cerebral brain iron accumulation confirmed by MRI (9 male, 11 female, mean age 35.1 years).

The NBIA syndromes were characterized by remarkable clinical hetero geneity. The clinical symptoms varied from the mild Parkinsonism over the isolated torticollis to severe dystonia. Conclusion: In the Hungarian population the mutations of MPAN gene are more frequent compared to other populations. The symptoms caused by particular mutations of the single genes are not specific, although the extra pyramidal motor dysfunction with various degrees was observed in almost all cases.

23699,"We recently reported the first gene, PCSK6, associated with handedness at genome wide significance level (P< 0.5*10 8, Brandler et al. 2013). A Va riable Number Tandem Repeat (VNTR) within the same PCSK6 locus has been found to be associated with degree of handedness in an indepen dent study (Arning et al. 2013). Interestingly, PCSK6 is known to activate NODAL, a morphogen involved in a highly conserved pathway known to regulate left/right body axis determination. Our previous data suggest these pathways controlling development of LR asymmetry in the body are reused for brain midline development, which in turn influence functional asymmetries such as handedness (Brandler and Paracchini 2014). All pre vious most significant associations fall within a linkage disequilibrium (LD) block containing a secondary promoter our data show to be bidirectional in nature and controlling transcription of both a novel PCSK6 isoform and a long non coding antisense RNA. Taking forward previous GWAS findings, we have conducted a detailed functional analysis using a combination of further genetic analysis, in silico predictions, and molecular assays. Our functional studies support an allele specific effect on transcription factor binding affinity for a previous top associated SNP rs11855425 however our genetic data could not find any evidence supporting a VNTR role. With this study we have dissected the molecular mechanisms underlying the PCSK6 association with handedness, indicating the regulatory effect the region has on specific RNA isoforms.

This group is clinically heterogeneous suggesting genetic heterogenei ty. To characterize the genetic background of these PEHO like patients, we performed exome sequencing for 27 sporadic patients. In 4 cases also the parents were exome sequenced. As the group clinically overlaps with early infantile epileptic encephalopathies, where new mutations account for a substantial proportion of patients, we focused on analysis of de novo mutations. Utilizing the Finnish exome database SISu, which included data from 3200 individuals, we were able to significantly restrict the number of candidate variants. We have identified a likely pathogenic mutation in 16 individuals, of whom 13 were exome sequenced without parents and three with parents. Of the 16 identified mutations 14 were validated to be de novo by Sanger sequencing in full trios. Four of the validated de novo mutations were in genes previously not associated with disease. Our data imply that exome sequencing combined with an ethnically matched reference database is an efficient method for identification of de novo mutations and does not necessitate sequencing of full trios.",2015

It also functions as a scaffold protein that plays a role in lens membrane organization . We present a boy diagnosed with hereditary neuropathy and cataract carrying a novel homozygous mutation mutations in the PRX gene. The proband is a 5 year old boy with normal cognition he had delayed mo tor milestones and subcapsular cataract. His healthy parents are of Muslim Arab origin and unrelated. He has experienced frequent falls since early age, however, his motor deficiencies tend to ameliorate with time. Neurological examination revealed: weakness of the distal lower limbs muscles and ab sence of deep tendon reflexes. NCV demonstrated dramatic symmetrical re duction of sensory and motor velocity of the lower limbs, compatible with a demyelinating process. Whole exome sequencing of the boyÃ¢ÂÂs DNA revealed a novel homozygote frameshift mutation, c.418 419insG (p. M149 fs) in the PRX gene, confirmed by Sanger sequencing. The parents are heterozygote carriers of the mutation. Hence this seems to be the disease causing mutati on in this boy. This is a new clinical manifestation of PRX related hereditary neuropathies. Lens abnormality caused by mutations in the PRX gene were shown only in knock out mice.

23702,"Bilateral accumulation of calcium in the brain, mostcommonly in the basal ganglia, but also in the cerebellum, thalamus, and brainstem can be inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion and is then referred to as primary familial brain calcifications (PFBC). PFBC is a clini cally and genetically heterogeneous disorder. Despite prominent calcifica tions some individuals remain asymptomatic while others become severely affected by motor, cognitive and psychiatric symptoms. To date, mutations in three genes (SLC20A2 , PDGFRB , and PDGFB ) have been linked to PFBC. Interestingly, a whole gene deletion of SLC20A2 has recently been identified indicating that copy number variations may play a role in the pathogenesis of PFBC. We screened eleven PFBC patients (four sporadic cases and seven patients from four families) for exonic deletions or multiplications in the SLC20A2 gene. All patients were tested negative for point mutations in SLC20A2 , PDGFRB , and PDGFB. The presence of copy number variations of SLC20A2 was investigated by quantitative real time PCR. Each of the eleven exons of SLC20A2 was tested. A sample carrying a heterozygous deletion of all SL C20A2 exons was included as a positive control. Quantification of SLC20A2 revealed a large deletion encompassing exons six to ten in one patient from an Italian family. No additional alterations were found in the other screened individuals. This result further underlines the importance of copy number variations in the etiology of PFBC. In conclusion, quantitative mutational screening of SL C20A2 is warranted in affected families without pathogenic small sequence changes in known PFBC genes.",2015

To date, 3 mutations in the mitochondrial targeting sequence (MTS) of the PNKD gene account for all the cases in the literature. We describe a family in which the proband presented with a Ã¢ÂÂstroke likeÃ¢ÂÂ episode aged 43. Symptoms, including cognitive dysfunction and impaired motor function, subsided after 2 hours leaving the patient with a severe headache. Exten sive investigations showed no evidence of a stroke. The patientÃ¢ÂÂs father has had over 50 episodes of weakness, labelled Ã¢ÂÂstrokesÃ¢ÂÂ, from a young age but without residual deficit. In light of this, screening for Ã¢ÂÂhemiplegic migraineÃ¢ÂÂ was requested. Sequencing using a next generation sequencing (NGS) panel of 11 genes encoding brain ion channel proteins detected a deletion of a C nucleotide in the last exon of the PNKD gene, c.1022delC p.(Pro341fs), in the patient and her father. This deletion results in a premature stop codon 3 amino acids downstream and a slightly truncated protein. While it is unlike ly that the protein will undergo nonsense mediated mRNA decay (functional work is ongoing to confirm this), the function of the hydroxyacyl glutathio ne hydrolase domain may be disrupted leading to the build up of the toxic metabolite methylglyoxal and related compounds which may reasonably be assumed to cause the phenotype. This case report expands the PKND mu tation spectrum, resolves the diagnosis for this family and emphasises the usefulness of NGS in a diagnostic setting.",2015

Symptoms are hypoplasia and/or atrophy of the pons and cerebellum and patients suffer from severe cognitive and motor defects. Aberrations in different tRNA pro cessing genes, e.g. the tRNA splicing endonuclease (TSEN) genes and cleava ge and polyadenylation factor 1 subunit 1 (CLP1), have been associated with PCH. However the disease mechanism remains elusive. Our research focuses on further revealing the link between PCH and tRNA processing. For this, we select genes of the tRNA processing pathway and assess their possible involvement in the PCH disease mechanismMaterial and methods: Exome sequencing was performed in 25 PCH pati ents and 5 trios.

Knock down of RtcA results in microcephaly, aberrant movement and abnormal brain development in zebrafish. Exome sequencing revealed a homozygous missense mutation at the active site of RtcA in a PCH2 patient. Conclusion: RtcA is possibly involved in the same pathway as other PCH associated genes and invigorates the involvement of the tRNA processing pathway.",2015

Pontocerebellar hypoplasia (PCH) is a group of disorders that share a com mon feature of an abnormally small cerebellum and pons. Involvement of the cerebrum, such as progressive microcephaly, is also common. It is highly heterogeneous, and eight subtypes on clinical and genetic basis have been known. PCH type III (PCH3) is one of the subtypes we reported in an Oma ni pedigree and mapped to chromosome 7q11 21. We have extended the study of this pedigree performing genetic analysis including genome wide SNP genotyping, linkage analysis and whole exome sequencing identifying a homozygous nonsense mutation in the gene Piccolo (PCLO) as the cause of PCH3. The variant was predicted to eliminate the PDZ and C2 domains in the C terminus of the protein. PCLO is a component of the presynaptic cytoskeletal matrix. It localizes to the synaptic active zone, and is thought to be involved in regulation of presynaptic proteins and synaptic vesicles. Our findings suggest that PCLO is crucial for the development and survival of a wide range of neuronal types in the human brain.

23706,"Pontocerebellar hypoplasia (PCH) describes a heterogeneous group of neurodegenerative disorders with a prenatal onset. Common features are hypoplasia/atrophy of the cerebellum and ventral pons, progressive micro cephaly and severe mental and motor retardation. Ten subtypes (PCH1 10) are described based on differences in phenotype and/or genotype. The ma jority of the PCH genes are involved in RNA processing. In about 40% of patients a mutation in one of the PCH related genes is identified, in 60% the genetic cause remains unknown. One of the goals of our research is to iden tify new candidate genes involved in PCH. Here we describe an atypical PCH patient with a neuronal migration disorder. A SNP array and read number analysis of exome data was suggestive of a mosaic paternal uniparental di somy (UPD) of chromosome 15q24.2 15qter, which was confirmed by sin gle cell genotyping. 34% of cells were homozygous for the paternal allele in this region and 64% of cells were heterozygous. The supposed mechanism is a somatic recombination. Upon re examination of the exome variants, a deleterious heterozygous mutation in the POLG gene was identified on the maternal allele. POLG is essential for the replication of mitochondrial DNA and homozygosity for this mutation is supposed to be lethal. This probably explains the absence of cell homozygous for the maternal 15q allele. Ten tatively, we would like to hypothesize that this cell line existed but died at some point during fetal development, leading to the brain phenotype in this patient.",2015

As part of the UKBEC project, we used Weighted Gene Coexpression Network Analysis (WGCNA) to explore the brain transcriptomes of 101 neuropathologically normal in dividuals to investigate the biological relationships between known PD ge nes and PD associated loci. In substantia nigra, the region most affected by PD pathogenesis, we identified two modules; one significantly enriched for Gene Ontology terms related to mitochondrion and oxidative phosphoryla tion, and the other for synapse related terms.

The evaluation of 12 samples of the diseased brain and 12 control samples has shown a striking ABSTRACTS POSTERS ESHG 2015 | GLASGOW, SCOTLAND, UK | WWW. ESHG. ORG 193Back to inde x discrepancy between schizophrenia and unaffected counterparts. Chromo some arrangement in interphase nuclei of the schizophrenia brain was com pletely different from the unaffected brain. The diseased brain has exhibited 10 40% of cells affected by genome/chromosome instability manifested as aneuploidy and chromosome breakage of chromosome 1. Additionally, re maining cells have almost all demonstrated a phenotype specific for chromo some instability. More precisely, 23 48% of cells in the schizophrenia brain were featured by the chromosome 1 localization at the nuclear periphery in contrast to controls characterized by chromosome 1 positioning near the nu cleolus. Since such nuclear organization characterizes cellular populations affected by chromosome instability, we have suggested that these changes are likely to mediate genome instability in the schizophrenia brain. Accor dingly, intranuclear organization of chromosomes in brain cells seems to be a new (previously unrecognized) epigenetic mechanism for schizophrenia.

A newborn girl presented with severe respiratory distress needing intuba tion, continuous coarse tremor, lung hypoplasia, dysmorphic features, bell shaped thorax and arthrogryphosis. EEG was initially normal but pathologi cal at age 2 weeks. Two cerebral MRIs were normal. EMG findings suggested lower motor neuron disease. Epilepsy progressed and was refractory to treatment. She died after extubation at age 4 weeks. The mother felt tremor from the second trimester and no other fetal movements, and tremor was also observed by ultrasound in gestation week 24. Methods and results: SNP array and tests for SMA, Schinzel Gideon syn drome and patUPD14 were normal. Whole exome sequencing revealed a de novo novel missense variant in SCN8A: c.718A>G p.(Ile240Val). Missen se mutations in this gene cause epileptic encephalopathy with intellectual disability. SCN8A encodes Nav1.6, the ÃÂ± subunit of a voltage gated neuronal sodium channel. This variant is located in an intracellular loop in juxtaposi tion to a transmembrane segment that operates as a gate sensor. Notably, an Ile to Val substitution in an equivalent position within another transmem brane domain (highly similar structure) was reported in a boy with neona tal epileptic encephalopathy, multiple congenital anomalies and movement disorder (Vaher et al; J Child Neurol 2014). Conclusion: We report the first data on prenatal onset of movement disorder, including severe respiratory distress, likely caused by a missense variant in SCN8A. Dysmorphic features and arthrogryphosis are probably secondary to fetal akinesia. Our data adds to previous literature extending the pheno typic spectrum of variants in this gene.",2015

Children with developmental disorders may exhibit a variety of clinical phenotypes. One of the most common phe notypes observed in probands in the DDD study is seizures. To date, the DDD study has analysed 4295 trios, 748 (17.4%) present with seizures. We attempted to identify mutations in genes that contribute to seizures within the subset of probands with at least one subtype of seizu res. We sequenced the exomes of the members of each trio and interrogated genetic variants from the exome for de novo mutations within the probands. We identified genes significantly enriched with de novo mutations.

Based on ExAc, c.2128C>T was identified 6 times (MAF 0.00005) and c.2218G>A was identified 132 times (MAF 0.001, two homozygous cases). Both variants are located in highly conserved amino acid positions. Several, but not all, prediction programs suggested pathogenicity. qPCR experiments are ongoing to exclude large deletions/duplications. The patient has since the age of 8 months an early onset episodic ataxia, failure to thrive, deve lopmental delay, dystonic posturing and seizures. At the age of 12 years, the patient shows in addition progressive cerebellar atrophy.

Introduction : Cerebellar ataxias (CA) and hereditary spastic paraplegias (HSP) are opposite ends of a wide spectrum of neurodegenerative disor ders known as spinocerebellar degenerations. Approximately 200 causative genes have been identified, and transmission follows all classical modes. Therefore, next generation sequencing (NGS) is of great help in their mole cular diagnosis, as well as for identifying new causative genes in unresolved families. Methods: We used a combined approach of whole genome linkage analy sis and exome sequencing in two families with either CA or HSP , aiming to identify the causative genes. Their involvement was validated with panel se quencing approaches, and functional studies when available. Results: In a CA family, we identified a missense mutation in GRID2 , hetero zygous in late onset affected adults, and homozygous in a child with conge nital CA. In two patients with congenital CA, we identified GRID2 mutations mimicking the Lurcher mouse model. In a family with HSP , a ALDH18A1 mis sense mutation segregated with dramatically low plasma levels of citrulline, making it a potential trait biomarker. Four additional pedigrees, and in vitro analyses of ornithine metabolism, allowed establishing protein dysfunc tion. Conclusion: Both GRID2 and ALDH18A1 had been implicated in autosomal recessive disorders in humans. With functional evidence, we established, in both cases, that AD transmission can occur, and is linked to a different phe notype. Aside from the novelty in the field of spinocerebellar degenerations, this illustrates the permanent landscape remodelling that occurs in human genetics since the arousal of NGS.

Apolipoprotein E is involved in nerve tissue integrity and encoded by the APOE gene. The ÃÂµ4 al lelic variant of the APOE gene was associated with greater severity for brain injury in boxers. Therefore, this studyÃ¢ÂÂs aim was to investigate the associati on between APOE variants and concussion profile in rugby players. Materials and Methods: In this case control genetic association study, 198 previously concussed cases and 129 non concussed, sport matched con trols (age: 15 39 years old) were recruited from rugby playing schools and clubs. Participants were genotyped for rs405509 (G/T), rs429358 (ÃÂµ3/ÃÂµ4) and rs7412 (ÃÂµ2/ÃÂµ3) variants within the APOE gene. Sport, concussion and medical history were recorded. Inferred haplotype analyses were conduc ted. Results: No significant genotype or allele frequency differences were noted between cases and controls (>P,0.149) and for concussion symptom dura tion in cases (>P,0.253). However, the frequencies of the age adjusted infer red G ÃÂµ4 ÃÂµ3 (28% vs. 24%; P<0.001) and G ÃÂµ3 ÃÂµ2 (25% vs. 19%; P,0.001) haplotypes, of the APOE variants (rs405509 rs429358 rs7412), were signi ficantly greater among cases compared to controls, respectively. Conclusion: Although the independent APOE genotype frequencies were not associated with concussion susceptibility or severity, the combined effect of the three APOE variants implicates APOE in concussion susceptibility. Further exploration is needed to understand the complex role of APOE in susceptibility. Grants: NRF and UCT . SA and SMF funded by NRF and MP by Thembakazi Trust.",2015

The genetic research project of TOSCA, which is limited to European countries, aims to improve our understanding of genotype/phenotype correlations in TSC. TSC is most often attributed to TSC1/TSC2 mutations, but limited genotype/phenotype correlations have been described so far due to the large number of mutations and the rela tively small sample size of studies. Nevertheless, it has been shown that patients with TSC2 mutation tend to be more severely affected, but with significant clinical overlap between individuals with TSC1 and TSC2 muta tions, to the extent that it is inadvisable to make a clinical judgment based on an individualÃ¢ÂÂs mutation type. At first interim analysis of TOSCA, molecu lar testing had been performed on 301 of 508 (59.3%) patients. Pathogenic mutations were reported in 224 (74.4%) patients. Median time from clinical diagnosis to molecular testing was 30 months (range, 0 655). Overall, 125 (24.6%) patients had Ã¢ÂÂ¥1 relative diagnosed with TSC.

Of these characteristics, only corpus callosum agenesis was present in this patient. ConclusionAlthough the patient does not fulfill the clinical criteria for Vici syndrome, we believe the two novel heterozygous mutations are the likely cause for the corpus callosum agenesis.

However, the etiological diagnosis remains unknown in up to 40% of patients. We searched for de novo mutations in 10 ISs probands and their unaffected parents using WES. Inclusion criteria were the lack of consanguinity and of family history of epi lepsy, as well as exclusion of common causes of ISs by brain MRI, metabolic screening, array CGH and screening for mutations in CDKL5 and STXBP1, and for ARX duplications in males.

He has a similarly affected younger brother. His maternal grandfather had psychiatric issues, his motherÃ¢ÂÂs brother suffers from schizophrenia, autism, hypotonia and gait disturbance. Materials and Methods: The patient was evaluated for Niemann Picktype C disease and SCA17 but no mutation could be identified.

DIAGNOSIS AND MANAGEMENT OF ROMANIAN CHILDREN WITH WIL LIAMS BEUREN SYNDROME (WBS) OBJECTIVE: The present study focuses on the evaluation of the clinical cha racteristics of pediatric patients with WBS, to design a personalized manage ment plan, to prevent the complications and to improve the prognostic. MATERIAL AND METHODS: 22 children clinically and genetically dia gnosed with WBS. The clinical diagnosis was based on the WBS diagnostic scoring system; FISH tests were performed to confirm the diagnostic. RESUL TS: All children were refered to our department for intellectual disa bility; 35% of them associated motor delay and 48%, poor language deve lopment. All children presented specific facial dysmorphism. Most children had particular behavior: temporal spatial disorientation, hyperacusis, and attraction to music (100%); hypersociability (65%); hyperkinesias (35%); fussy eating patterns (12%). 17% of the children had cardiovascular dis orders and 6% presented hypercalcemia. Some children presented atypical features: 2 children had autism and 1 child associated Marfan syndrome. 29% of patients were enrolled in physical therapy, and 42%, in different ty pes of cognitive and behavioral therapy. Most of these children improved in their psychomotor development, well integrating in regular education. 12% of the children were not enrolled in any therapeutic program and presented very slow psychomotor aquisitions, thus preventing their enrollment in any type of education. CONCLUSIONS: Most of our patients presented the classical picture of WBS, but some children had different particularities which contributed to a delayed diagnosis. The management of WBS patients requires a multidis ciplinary approach, and is essential for a better social integration of these children.

A ~440kb homozygous deletion was identified at 16q23.1(77.75 78.19Mb). Homozygous deletions segregated entirely with affected children. Healthy siblings and parents were either heterozygous or normal. The deletion con tains four RefSeq genes (NUDT7, VAT1L, CLEC3A and exons 1 4 of WWOX). Collation of our cohort and those published to date suggest an emerging pattern of poor postnatal growth, microcephaly and onset of seizures in the first year of life. Visual impairment and hypotonia are also observed, together with multiple deaths, mostly related to epilepsy. Specific genotype phenotype granularities, potentially related to differing mutational mecha nism / CNV gene content are presented.

Earlier studies identi fied seven different genetic alterations within a 427 kb disease locus on the X chromosome; however, the exact disease causing variant among these is still not unequivocally determined. To further investigate the genetic cause of this disease, we sequenced all previously reported genetic alterations in 166 patients and 473 Filipino controls. Singly occurring variants in our eth nically matched controls would have allowed us to define these as polymor phisms, but none were found. Instead, we identified five patients carrying none of the disease associated variants, and one male control carrying all of them. In parallel, we searched for novel single nucleotide variants using next generation sequencing. We did not identify any shared variants in co ding regions of the X chromosome. However, by validating intergenic vari ants discovered via genome sequencing, we were able to define the bounda ries of the disease specific haplotype and narrow the disease locus to a 294 kb region that includes four known genes. Using microarray based analyses, we ruled out the presence of disease linked copy number variants within the implicated region. Finally, we utilized in silico analysis and detected no strong evidence of regulatory regions surrounding the disease associated variants.

We present a 20 months old boy, the third child of Israeli Druze first degree cousins. He presented with AMC, hypotonia, hearing impairment, FTT and mild motor delay. His older deceased sister was described with a similar but more severe pheno type, which included AMC, cleft palate, feeding problems and severe deve lopmental delay. The extended family includes a 16 y/o cousin presenting with isolated AMC, whose deceased sister was described with AMC and cleft palate. A variable intra familial phenotype and expected autosomal recessive inhe ritance prompted molecular diagnosis by whole exome sequencing. MethodsFollowing informed consent by the parents, whole exome sequencing was conducted on the childÃ¢ÂÂs genomic DNA. Variant analysis focused on rare ho mozygous changes, followed by validation of candidate variants via Sanger sequencing and segregation analysis. ResultsExome analysis revealed a homozygous missense variant in the MYBPC1 gene, NM_001254718.1:c.481G>A (p. E161K), affecting the last nucleotide of exon 6. This novel variant was not observed in the common variant databa ses and segregated as expected within the extended family. DiscussionThe MYBPC1 gene encodes a slow skeletal muscle isoform, essential for mu scle contraction. Heterozygous mutations in this gene are associated with distal arthrogryposis type 1b, whereas a homozygous nonsense mutation is implicated in lethal congenital contracture syndrome 4.

Peripheral blood samples were taken from the patients and genomic DNA was isolated. Direct sequencing of the NEB and MTM1 genes was performed.

In case of the patient suffering from centronuclear myopathy, the genetic analysis detected a hemizygous nonsense mutation (c.1456C/T p. Arg486X CM990881) in the MTM1 gene.

The most common genetic cau se of the inherited peripheral neuropathy Charcot Marie Tooth disease is the PMP22 duplication; otherwise, CNVs have been considered rare. We investigated CNVs in a population based sample of Charcot Marie Tooth (CMT) families. The 81 CMT families had previously been screened for the PMP22 duplication and point mutations in 51 peripheral neuropathy genes, a genetic cause was identified in 37 CMT families (46%). Index patients from the 44 CMT families with an unknown genetic diagnosis were analysed by whole genome array comparative genomic hybridization to investigate the entire genome for larger CNVs, and multiplex ligation dependent probe amplification to detect smaller intragenomic CNVs in MFN2 and MPZ. One patient had the pathogenic PMP22 duplication not detected by previous methods. Three patients had potentially pathogenic CNVs in the CNTNAP2 , LAMA2 or SEMA5A , i.e. genes related to neuromuscular or neurodevelop mental disease . Genotype and phenotype correlation indicated likely pa thogenicity for the LAMA2 CNV, the CNTNAP2 and SEMA5A CNVs remained potentially pathogenic. Except from the PMP22 duplication, disease causing CNVs are rare but may cause CMT in about 1% (95% CI 0 7%) of the Norwegian CMT families. ABSTRACTS POSTERS ESHG 2015 | GLASGOW, SCOTLAND, UK | WWW.

23740,", Newcastle Upon Tyne, United Kingdom. Background Congenital myasthenic syndromes (CMS) are a group of genetically hetero geneous disorders characterised by compromised function at the NMJ. CMS manifests in childhood with fatigable weakness of limb, ocular and bulbar muscles. There are ~20% patients with a clinical diagnosis that still remain genetically undiagnosed despite over 20 known CMS genes. AimsTo identify novel CMS genes by whole exome sequencing (WES).Methods DNA from a cohort of patients with a clinical diagnosis of CMS was sent to deCODE genetics for WES. Variants in the exome were filtered to exclude those with a frequency greater than 1%, those unlikely to significantly im pact the protein or not compatible with the inheritance model. Remaining variants were segregated within the families. Three potential candidate ge nes were identified in four families, which were then analysed in vitro and in vivo where possible. Zebrafish orthologues were identified for two of the genes, these were then knocked down via antisense morpholino oligonu cleotide (MO) injection and phenotype investigated. Results MO injection in zebrafish for two genes caused abnormal movement in re sponse to tactile stimulation, shortening and abnormal branching of motor axons, poorly defined somites and disorganisation of muscle fibres. ConclusionThree genes have been identified as possible causative genes in CMS by WES. The preliminary studies carried out on zebrafish demonstrated phe notypes consistent with CMS such as disorganisation of muscle architecture and abnormal branching of motor axons. To confirm results obtained using MOs, we plan to utilise CRISPR technology to target the genes in zebrafish.",2015

Neurodegenerative diseases are becoming increasingly prevalent with the aging population, and are among the major contributors to disability and disease worldwide. The identification of the gene defects responsible has played a major role in our understanding of the pathogenic processes invol ved, and provided opportunity to develop targeted treatment strategies. The neuromuscular junction (NMJ) is a specialised synapse with a complex molecular architecture that provides for reliable transmission between the nerve terminal and muscle fibre. We previously identified a mutation in SL C5A7, which encodes the presynaptic choline transporter critical for nor mal NMJ signalling, as the cause of a dominantly inherited motor neurone disease (distal hereditary motor neuropathy type VII; dHMN VII). We esta blished that the mutation responsible resulted in the dominant negative interference of the mutant molecule with function of the wild type choli ne transporter, resulting in significantly reduced (although not completely abolished) transporter activity. Here, we investigated a second family with clinical features overlapping those of dHMN VII. We identified a distinct fra meshift SLC5A7 mutation indicative of a similar dominant negative disease mechanism. We also modelled the mutation identified in a cell based sy stem to investigate transporter function. Together our findings corroborate a dominant negative disease mechanism arising from SLC5A7 mutation as a cause of dHMN VII, and provide further insight into the role of aberrant choline transporter function in neurological disease.

Methods: in 68 patients follow up was from 6 up to 18 years (allwith verified mutations of dystrophin gene). Cardiac examination was made. ABSTRACTS POSTERS ESHG 2015 | GLASGOW, SCOTLAND, UK | WWW. ESHG. ORG 199Back to inde x Result: all the patients were found to have indications for the use of an ACE inhibitor and almost half of the children had those for the administration of beta blocker. Patients were divided in two groups: group I (n,35) received long term courses of an ACE inhibitor (captopril in a dose of 0,5 mg/kg/day) and a beta blocker (metoprolol by individually adjusting its dose). Despite recommendations, Group 2 (n,33) were not treated with the above drugs. Mortalityin group I during the follow up period was 37% (13 patients), in group II 60% (20 patients). In group I mean death age was 21,15 years, in group II 18,25 years (no significant difference were found). The part of survived patients to the age of 21 years was significantly higher in group I: related frequency 0,77 (95% CI 0,5983 Ã¢ÂÂ¯0,94) versus 0,39 (95% CI 0,19 Ã¢ÂÂ¯0,5974).

23743,"A fifty year old woman was referred to our laboratory for analysis of the dystrophin gene. Her brother had died from Duchenne muscular dystrophy with unknown molecular cause. Based on elevated CK levels in 1988 she had been identified as probable DMD carrier. After exclusion of a large de letion/duplication sequencing of the DMD coding region revealed the novel heterozygous variant: c.1329C>T . The substitution is synonymous, but as it is located near the end of exon 11, an effect on splicing was suspected. In order to prove or exclude such an effect transcript analysis was essential. A muscle biopsy was not feasible and the possibility of creating a lymphobla stoid cell line was lacking. Therefore RNA extraction from buccal and nasal epithelial cells was attempted. Even though full length dystrophin is not ex pected to be expressed in these tissues, nasal epithelial cells, but not buccal cells, proved to be a good source of DMD mRNA for our purpose. An aberrant transcript not present in a normal control was identified, reamplified and sequenced. The aberrant transcript was found to lack the four last bases of exon 11, r.1328_1331delGCAA, thus leading to a frameshift and a premature stop codon, p.(Ser443Ilefs*5). The results were in accordance with sever al in silico analyses. Taken together our findings yield convincing evidence, that c.1329C>T indeed is a disease causing mutation. Furthermore, nasal epithelial cells, which in contrast to muscle biopsies and blood samples can be obtained in a non invasive way, proved to be a good alternative material for transcript analysis.",2015
23744,"Introduction: Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is an X linked recessive genetic dystrophinopathy related to the absence of Dystrophin cytoskeletal protein. This disease affects generally boys; women are vectors. Objective: In this context, we report a molecular study in a Tunisian family affected by DMD. Genetic analysis showed a particular transmission profile indicating a maternal germline mosaicism. Patients and methods: Here we report a family composed by four boys and two girls. Genetic study was performed by MLPA and a modified fluorescent PCR (TP PCR). MLPA allowed deletions and duplications analysis of different dystrophinÃ¢ÂÂs gene exons. Genotyping of six microsatellite markers, using the TP PCR technique, helped to establish the haplotype of each individual and to follow its transmission in this family. Result: MLPA showed, in both affected boys, a deletion of the exons 61 and 62 of the Dystrophin gene. However, the genotyping study revealed the pre sence of the disease associated haplotype in three boys in whom one is phe notypically healthy with no deletion responsible for the disease. Discussion and Conclusion: Genetic analysis showed a particular transmis sion profile indicating a maternal germline mosaicism. She transmitted the same haplotype of the X chromosome to three of her sons, of which only two are sick and carrying the deletion of exons 61 and 62 of the Dystrphin gene. This can be explained by the presence of two cell populations in the germ cells of the mother: one carries the deletion and the other not, allowing a random transmission of the disease to her sons.",2015

Several di sease genes of fetal akinesia have been described, but the genetic etiology of majority of cases is still unknown. We report on a family with recurrent fetal loss, where the parents had five affected fetuses with fetal akinesia deformation sequence (FADS [MIM 208150]) and one healthy child. The fetuses displayed no fetal movements from gestational age of 17 weeks, extended knee joints, flexed hips and el bows and clenched hands. There was polyhydramnion and no visible fetal stomach. Whole exome sequencing were performed on a family trio and only one candidate homozygous variant was identified in the fetus, c.40dupA (p. Thr14Asnfs*9), located in MuSK (muscle, skeletal, receptor tyrosine ki nase). Segregation analysis revealed homozygosity for all affected fetuses, while the variant was not present in the healthy child. The c.40dupA variant leads to a frameshift in MuSK predicting a premature stop codon, but the mutated mRNA is not cleared by nonsense mediated decay pathway, which is currently under investigation. MuSK is an agrin dependent receptor tyrosine kinase required for formati on of the neuromuscular junction and missense mutations in this gene have previously been described in congenital myasthenic syndrome (CMS). In terestingly, MuSK is located in the same acetylcholine receptor pathway as several other genes reported to cause CMS and/or FADS.

23746,"Introduction: In heterogeneous group of hereditary motor and sensory CMT neuropathies, GJB1 mutations causing M. Charcot Marie Tooth X type 1 (CM TX1) are considered to be second most common, following PMP22 variants. The disease is most often characterized by severe distal muscles weakness and atrophy, sensory loss and foot deformity. Female carriers can be mildly affected or asymptomatic. The diagnosis is suspected on NCV profile, fea turing an intermediate velocity range. We report the results of GJB1 clinical and molecular study in the first series of Croatian CMT patients. Objective: The detection and phenotypic characterization of GJB1 mutations in Croatian CMT patients. Materials and methods: Following clinical and EMG examination, 22 suspec ted samples from 18 families, negative for PMP dupl/del, were analyzed for the mutations in GJB1 coding region. Applied Biosystems 3130xl Genetic analyzer and BigDyeÃÂ® Terminator v3.1 Cycle Sequencing Kit were used. The prediction of new variants pathogenicity was made with PolyPhen 2 software. Results: GJB1 missense point mutations were found in 12 patients from 9 fa milies (7 heterozygous, 5 hemizygous). In 3 unrelated families p. Val170Asp was found. In each of the remaining 6 families different mutations were found (p. Leu108Pro, p. Val13Met, p. Ser49Pro, p. Arg183His). Two mutations were not described previously: p. Phe141Ser (c.422T>C) and p. Val177Met (c.529G>A). Very severe phenotype was characteristic of novel p. Phe141Ser in hemizygous and also heterozygous state. Cardinal phenotypic features are compared. Conclusions: GJB1 mutations were found in one half of CMTX1 suspected pa tients/families.

Mov Disord 2011;26:2279 2283) was investigated. An autosomal re cessive mode of inheritance was assumed in the five affected siblings. The ancestors and two siblings were healthy. In order to identify the genetic cause, genome sequencing was performed in two patients. Filtering for rare, shared, homozygous variants, predicted to alter the protein sequence revealed variants in six different genes (FER1L6, ABP1, DIAPH3, DUSP5, EMG1, MPP2). Since none of the variants segregated within the family, fil tering for compound heterozygous variants identified eight candidate genes (SQLE, SPRED1, GNE, LEFTY1, MYH9, CDC42BPA, DHX57, STAB1). Only the two variants in GNE (p. R101C, p. L332F [NP_005467]) segregated with the disease in the family. While L332F was novel and not found in ethnically matched controls, R101C had a minor allele frequency of 0.3% in 190 Paki stani controls and of 0.002% among Europeans at http://exac.broadinstitu te.org/gene/ENSG00000164116. Both variants are in silico predicted to be pathogenic and are located in the epimerase domain of Glucosamine (UDP N acetyl) 2 epimerase/N acetylmannosamine kinase (GNE). GNE encodes a bifunctional enzyme needed for the rate limiting step in sialic acid synthe sis. Experiments to access epimerase activity in the mutants are underway. Mutations in GNE are known to cause GNE related myopathy and sialuria. A disease causing effect of our GNE variants might suggest pleiotropy for mutations in GNE.

This is a frontline diagnostic tool and has largely replaced single gene Sanger sequencing. Of the 56 genes included, 26 are associated with an autosomal recessive form of the condition, and for the majority of those no diagnostic service was pre viously available.

Autosomal recessive inheritance might typically be expected in severe, early onset, progressive neuropathy; however in our cohort a large proportion of patients were over 18 upon genetic diagnosis, including some cases assu med to be sporadic. This broadens the spectrum of phenotypes associated with recessive genes. Our data shows that gene panel testing is a powerful, unbiased approach for genetic diagnosis in IPN.

Stromal interaction molecule 1 (STIM1), which modulates calcium flow through RYR1, plays an important role in skeletal muscle differentiation. Mutations in STIM1 have been previously shown to result in immunodefici ency and myopathy.

23752,"Myotonic Dystrophy type 1 and 2 (DM1, DM2) together represent the most common muscular dystrophies in adults with a frequency of 1:8000. Both diseases are associated with an expansion of a microsatellite repeat within the untranslated regions of two different genes, DMPK and ZNF9, respec tively. Currently, the gold standard for genetic DM diagnosis is Southern blotting by which the repeat sizes for DM1 can be determined accurately. This is not the case for DM2, due to the somatic instability of the expanded alleles. Therefore, we developed an alternative diagnostic technique for DM based on molecular combing in order to analyze both repeat loci in parallel and to quantify expanded DM2 alleles. Molecular Combing is an in situ hybridization like technique where locus specific probes are hybridized to uniformly stretched genomic DNA. Dif ferent loci can be detected by individually designed probes. We designed a diagnostic protocol for assaying the DM1 and DM2 loci together in one approach. The two loci including the repeat itself are reliable detected by two different probe sets and repeat sizes can be measured directly with an accuracy of 0.8 kb (ÃÂ±0.4). For the first time, the Molecular Combing DM test allows for a quantification of expanded DM2 alleles on single molecules. We demonstrate that there is a wide size range of repeats in the sample of an individual DM2 patient which is in accordance with previous speculations in the literature. In order to use this method in routine diagnosis, impro vement of the detection limit is needed to distinguish normal alleles from short but pathogenic expansions.",2015

23755,"Introduction: Myotonic dystrophy type 2 (DM2) is caused by expansion of a (CCTG)n repeat in the CNBP1 gene. In healthy range alleles the repeat is ge nerally interrupted by one or more GCTG, TCTG or ACTG motifs. Uninterrup ted tracts were, however, described in expanded alleles as well as in larger healthy range alleles which are generally considered as DM2 premutations. The threshold for pathogenicity is still poorly described in the literature, while the smallest reported pathogenic alleles had 55 and 75 CCTG repeats, respectively. Materials and methods: For DNA analyses we used conventional PCR and bi directional repeat primed PCR complemented by Sanger sequencing and targeted massively parallel sequencing where needed. Results: We identified wider range and higher frequency of uninterrupted alleles than it was previously reported, with 15 alleles characterised in total, spanning the whole spectrum of healthy range alleles. We therefore further investigated the intergenerational stability of these alleles. Moreover, in two unrelated patients with symptoms of neuromuscular disorder we identified two ambiguous alleles, containing 31 and 34 uninterrupted CCTG repeats. Since further analyses revealed a full range DM1 expansion in the DMPK gene in the first patient and a homozygous CLCN1 stop mutation in the second patient we concluded that these Ã¢ÂÂgrey zoneÃ¢ÂÂ alleles are most likely not pathogenic themselves, although, they represent unstable premutation alleles. Their possible modifying role, however, cannot be conclusively dis closed. Conclusion: Our results suggest that uninterrupted alleles with up to ~30 CCTG repeats are likely stable during transmission, while instability gradu ally increases with increasing length of uninterrupted tracts above this ap proximate threshold (financial support: VEGA_2/0115/15).",2015

Diagnosis of the disease is very complicated at the young age, as the first symptoms appear, on average, at the age of 50 60 years. In this regard, especially promising are studies in the field of molecular ge netics, results of which can be used in early diagnosis of the disease. The objective of this work was to find genetic markers for ParkinsonÃ¢ÂÂs disease in populations in Ukraine. 350 patients with PD (210 men and 140 women) were examined after a mean disease duration of 7,6 ÃÂ± 0,33 years (mean age was 63,1 ÃÂ± 1,3 years).Genotyping was performed by PCR RFLP method and methods based on real time PCR. For the first time in Ukraine, major mutations in the ge nes PARK2, LRRK2, SNCA and GBA responsible for hereditary forms of ParkinsonÃ¢ÂÂs disease were genotyped. Frequencies of mutations in patients that had various peculiarities of the disease and were at different age of manifestation were analyzed. Comparison of telomere length in buccal cells and leukocytes of patients with PD and control group was carried out. Signi ficant differences were revealed in the length of telomeres in buccal epithe lium cells in patients and in controls, while in blood cells telomere length did not differ. In addition, a significant correlation between telomere length in blood cells and in buccal epithelial cells was found in patients, but not in control group.",2015
23761,"Introduction: Rett syndrome is a neurodevelopmental disorder due to de novo mutations in MECP2, CDKL5 or FOXG1 genes. MeCP2 and FoxG1 are transcriptional regulators; CDKL5 is a kinase involved in multiple cellular processes. In spite of their involvement in the same disease, a functional interaction between the three proteins has not been proven and disease me chanisms remain elusive. We reported recently that expression of GluD1 is increased in iPSCs derived neurons from patients with mutations in MECP2 and CDKL5 (Livide et al, Eur J Hum Genet 2015). GluD1 is a post synaptic protein that induces preferentially inhibitory presynaptic differentiation of cortical neurons. Methods: We established a human neuronal model based on patients speci fic iPSCs and we characterized their expression profile to test the hypothesis that common alterations occur in cells mutated in the three genes. Results: We identified an over expression of GluD1 also in FOXG1 mutated cells. Since GluD1 induces inhibitory presynaptic differentiation and an ex citation/inhibition imbalance has been suggested in MECP2 related Rett syndrome, we tested the expression of a panel of excitatory and inhibitory markers. Our results demonstrated an excitation/inhibition imbalance in neurons mutated in all three genes. A consistent imbalance was also obser ved in embryonic FOXG1+/ mouse brain. However, a reduction of both exci tatory and inhibitory markers is observed in post natal mouse models. Conclusions: Our data provide further evidence in favor of an excitation/in hibition imbalance as an important contributor to the pathogenesis of Rett due to MECP2 mutations and suggest a similar mechanism for CDKL5 and FOXG1 mutated patients.",2015
23762,"Introduction: Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is the most common autoso mal recessive disease causing death in infants. The disease is caused by the lack of SMN1. The copy number of a highly similar gene, SMN2, determines disease severity. It is difficult to measure SMN1 and SMN2 copy number ac curately since these two genes only differ by a single functional nucleotide. Although no therapies currently exist for SMA, five different pharmaceutical companies have therapies in clinical trials. To assess the efficacy of these therapies, it is necessary to measure the number of SMN2 copies accurately in each trial participant. Materials and Methods: 16 Coriell samples and 93 Kenyan, 70 Mexican, and 96 British HapMap samples were screened for SMN1 and SMN2 copy num ber using droplet digital PCR (ddPCR). Results: 99.2% of the samples measured within 10% of the integer for SMN1 and SMN2 copy number, and 100% were within 15% of the integer. In total: 5, 1, 204, 45, and 20 samples had 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 copies of SMN1, respective ly. Likewise, 43, 109, 108, 14, and 1 samples had 0, 1, 2, 3, and 5 copies of SMN2, respectively. None of the 275 samples had 4 copies of SMN2.Conclusions: ddPCR provides unambiguous copy number calls for SMN1 and SMN2 when Ã¢ÂÂ¤3 copies are present. We did not have sufficient number of samples with Ã¢ÂÂ¥4 copies to determine the accuracy of this technology for higher order copy number states.",2015

Homozygous deletion of SMN1 results in a spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) phenotype. Severity of the disease partially relies on the individual copy numbers and variants of the phenotypic modulator SMN2 . We used a NGS strategy of Ã¢ÂÂpooled indexingÃ¢ÂÂ for gene re sequencing of 41 SMA patients belonging from Italian and Spanish population. All subjects carry 3 copies of SMN2, 0 copies of SMN1 . We report a total of 115 SNPs, among which 60 never previously identified, and 5 indels among which only one previously described. All indels and most of SNPs are intronic, except than two conser vative SNPs in exon2a and exon3 respectively. The main intriguing results are: i. Variants distribution is not homogenous but rather clustered along the SMN2 sequence. The highest variant rate have been found in intron 7 (1:112bp), in intron 8 and 3Ã¢ÂÂUTR (1:152bp). These findings suggest that exon 7, which undergoes alternative splicing and is involved in modulating SMA phenotype, is flanked by hotspot of hyper mutable regions. ii. Only two individuals present the exon2a variant (c. C84T), while 33 out of 41 individu als present the exon3 variant (c. A462G). It will be intriguing to test the last variant as an hallmark of deletion prone chromosome 5. iii. In one patient we have a variants frequency sustaining 4 copies of SMN2 along the 5Ã¢ÂÂ of the gene and 3 copies of SMN2 along the 3Ã¢ÂÂ. This last result sustains quan titative re sequencing of SMN as a tool to improve diagnosis/prognosis by identifying partially deleted and non functional genes.

23765,"Background: Dominant mutations in STIM1 have been identified in the com plex phenotype Stormorken Syndrome (SS) and in non syndromic tubular aggregate myopathy (TAM). All reported individuals with SS have a common p. R304W gain of function mutation in the coiled coil domain 1 of STIM1. In contrast mutations in TAM are restricted to the EF hand domain. Methods and Patients: We performed exome sequencing on patient 1 and identified a de novo STIM1 mutation. We subsequently selected 4 patients with tubular aggregates, and 4 patients selected by phenotype, and perfor med immunostaining for STIM1 and direct sequencing of the STIM1 gene. Patients with STIM1 mutations were deep phenotyped. Results: Two patients with STIM1 mutations were identified. Patient 1 has the common SS mutation (p. R304W), and exhibits features in keeping with this (thrombocytopaenia, miosis, aspenia, hypocalcaemia). Tubular aggre gates were present in muscle biopsy and showed accumulation of STIM1. Patient 2 has a novel mutation at the same amino acid residue (p. R304G), and presents with a strikingly similar pattern of neuromuscular phenotype but aside from miosis no additional features of SS. The neuromuscular phe notype in both patients comprises myalgia, muscle stiffness, and reduction in range of joint movement, with mild weakness on examination. Conclusion: The use of STIM1 immunoananlysis in patients with tubular aggregates was successfully applied to screen for patients with STIM1 mu tations.

23766,"We developed a massively parallel sequencing approach in order to optimi ze clinical diagnosis of myopathies at La Timone Hospital (Marseille), which is a reference center for a number of neuromuscular disorders in France. In a pilot project, we selected 298 genes implicated in neuromuscular diseases and cardiomyopathies listed in the Gene Table of Neuromuscular Disorders as well as differential diagnosis genes. Targeted exome approach was deve loped using HaloPlex target enrichment system adapted for Ion Torrent Next Generation Sequencing technology. This initial study had 92% sequence co verage at 20x and resulted in 47% diagnostic yield in a cohort of 37 distal myopathy patients. Detailed analysis of the technical characteristics of the study allowed us to pinpoint the aspects that could be further optimized. For example, we observed that longer HaloPlex probes were lost at the emulsion PCR step. Moreover, results for several target genes were not interpretab le due to high rate of off target read alignment. Based on these results, an optimized set of HaloPlex probes for 306 genes was designed for Illumina sequencing technology. Forty six myopathy patients were screened for mu tations using this improved targeted exome approach. We believe that the diagnostic pipeline described in this study could be useful for other groups studying neuromuscular diseases.

Introduction Familial amyloid polyneuropathy (FAP) is an clinically heterogeneous au tosomal dominant trait. Mutations in the TTR gene are most commonly ob served. TTR is synthesized mainly in the liver and mutations in the gene result in misfolding and depositions of mutated TTR protein, cousing a life threatening nerve length dependent polyneuropathy. Until now, over 100 mutations are described that are reflected in the protein structure. Materials and MethodsBlood for DNA extraction was drawn after the patients signed an informed consent. DNA was isolated from 10ml whole blood using a commercially aviable kit (QIAamp DNA Blood Maxi Kit Qiagene). For the detection of va riants in TTR gene, coding region of the TTR gene was amplified and for the PCR fragments Sanger sequencing was performed (Macrogene). The obtai ned chromatograms were analysed with the aid of Chromas and CLC Main Workbench 5.5 programs. The obtained sequences were alined with the hu man reference sequence NG_009490. Detected variants were searched and confirmed in public databases such as dbSNP (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih. gov/SNP/) and Mutations in Hereditary Amyloidosis (http://amyloidosis mutations.com/cdna attr.html ). ResultsSix different variants in theTTR gene were observed (n,48) (rs1800458, rs28933979, rs121918090 , rs121918097, rs121918082 , rs36204272) in our patient population .

23768,"Tibial muscular dystrophy (TMD) is the first described human titinopathy. It is caused by mutations in the last two exons, Mex5 and Mex6, of titin gene (TTN ). The first reported TMD mutations were dominant and the Finnish founder mutation, an 11 bp insertion/deletion in Mex6, caused a severe ear ly onset limb girdle muscular dystrophy 2J (LGMD2J) when homozygous. Later we reported that not all TMD mutations cause LGMD when homozy gous, but some rather cause a more severe TMD. We have now performed a targeted next generation sequencing assay of myopathy related genes on six families with recessive distal titinopathy. Two novel TMD mutations in TTN were identified, which both seem to be recessive. Three of the families, Ita lian, Bosnian and Iranian, had a novel nonsense TMD mutation in TTN Mex5 in homozygous state or in combination with another nonsense mutation on the other allele. One Hungarian family had a novel missense TMD mutation in TTN Mex6 in combination with a frameshift mutation on the other alle le. In addition one Spanish family had a previously reported Iberian TMD mutation in combination with a frameshift mutation and another Spanish family had a novel missense mutation in TTN A band in combination with a nonsense mutation and a novel titinopathy phenotype. Family members with only one TTN mutation were healthy. According to our previous results the frameshift and nonsense mutations located upstream of the last exons of TTN cause degradation of mRNA through nonsense mediated decay and mainly the other mutated TTN allele is expressed.

23769,"Objective: Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is caused by homozygous inac tivation of the SMN1 gene. The SMN2 copy number modulates the severity of SMA. The 0SMN1/1SMN2 genotype, the most severe genotype compa tible with life, is expected to be associated with the most severe form of the disease, called type 0 SMA, characterized by severe neurologic impairment from birth. The aim of the study was to review clinical features and prenatal manifestations in this rare SMA subtype. Methods: SMA patients with the 0SMN1/1SMN2 genotype were retrospec tively collected using the UMD SMN1 France database. Data from 16 pati ents were reviewed. Results: These 16 patients displayed type 0 SMA. Most patients, at birth, had profound hypotonia, severe muscle weakness, severe respiratory distress, and cranial nerves involvement (inability to suck/swallow, facial muscles weakness). They also showed characteristics of fetal akinesia deformation sequence (FADS) and congenital heart defects (CHD). Recurrent episodes of bradycardia were observed. Death occurred within the first month. At pre natal stage, decreased fetal movements were frequently reported, mostly only by mothers, in late stages of pregnancy; increased nuchal translucency was reported in about half of the cases; CHD, abnormal amniotic fluid volu me, or joint contractures were occasionally reported. Interpretation: Despite a prenatal onset attested by severity at birth and signs of FADS, prenatal manifestations of type 0 SMA are not specific and not constant. Finally, as illustrated by the frequent association with CHD, type 0 SMA physiopathology is not restricted to motor neuron, highlighting that SMN function is critical for organogenesis during development.",2015

The FHL1 transcript profiles from two affected individuals were investigated in skin fibroblasts with quantitative real time PCR. This demonstrated loss of isoform A and B, and an almost 200 fold overexpressi on of isoform C confirming that lack of FHL1A and overexpression of FLH1C results in an extended phenotype of EDMD as recently shown by Tiffin et al.

Family history is significant for an older af fected deceased female sibling at 18 months of age, and four miscarriages of undetermined etiology. Whole exome sequencing detected a homozygous unclear variant (c.378C>Tp. G126G) in ARNT2 gene of both of the affected twins.

Using this experimental approach, we and others recently described new microdeletion/microduplication syndromes. Methods: A Ã¢ÂÂgenotype firstÃ¢ÂÂ approach, using aCGH, in which patients are characterized by a similar genomic rearrangement before a common clinical presentation has been used. Results: We report 13 new patients with proximal 19p13.3 submicroscopic rearrangements and review patients from the literature and public genomic databases such as DECIPHER and ISCA Consortium for a total of 37 cases. We describe the phenotypic findings and suggest these patients represent a new microdeletion/duplication syndrome at 19p13.3 band, with a 113.5 Kb critical region as Small Region of Overlapping harboring three genes. Common features consist of abnormal head circumference in most patients (macrocephaly with the deletions and microcephaly with the duplications), intellectual disability (ID) with developmental delay, hypotonia, speech de lay and common dysmorphic features. Discussion: This study provides detailed clinical information for geneticists to assist in the evaluation, diagnosis and management of individuals with similar genomic interstitial rearrangements at 19p13.3 band.",2015

BACKGROUND Ichthyosis Prematurity Syndrome (IPS) is characterized by premature birth, thick caseous desquamating epidermis, respiratory com plications and transient eosinophilia. Although respiratory problems can be severe, outcome after the first months is reported to be favorable. Mutations in FATP4 have been identified in this rare autosomal recessive disorder. METHODS We report on non identical twin brothers with consanguineous parents born prematurely at 30+4 gestational weeks, both with congenital skin lesions affecting the thorax, back and extremities, but most prominent ly the scalp. After birth, CPAP was needed for two days due to respiratory distress. At 6 weeks of age, intubation was necessary for 4 days in one boy due to apnea and desaturation. Serial brain ultrasound in both boys showed progressive striatal arteriopathy. Blood eosinophilia was demonstrated in both patients. At 2 months, the skin lesions improved tremendously, leaving only a reddish discoloration and dryness of the skin. RESULTS Initial skin pathology showed a verrucous epidermis and hyperke ratosis with corneal desquamation. Targeted genetic analysis revealed the presence of the homozygous c.469A>G change leading to the p. Asn157Asp amino acid substitution in the FATP4 gene, confirming the diagnosis of IPS in both boys. DISCUSSION Progressive striatal arteriopathy has not been described in IPS. Both boys showed eosinophilia, which can induce brain damage. In addition, encephalopathy is a known feature in eosinophilia associated conditions, i.e. Idiopathic Hypereosinophilia syndrome (OMIM 607685), Incontinentia Pigmenti (OMIM 308300) and autosomal recessive Hyper IgE syndrome (OMIM 243700). We hypothesize that hypereosinophilia may have been a causative factor for the striatal arteriopathy, which may be an underreco gnized finding in IPS.",2015

Progressively acquires suck swallow coordination and no si gnificant symptoms associated were observed. An atrial septal defect (ASD) (ostium secundum) was diagnosed by echocardiography and the patient was discharged for control in external consultations. On the exploration at 3m slightly decreased axial, lower limbs on flexion (without arthrogryposis), increased tendon reflexes, and peculiar phenoty pic traits (hypertelorism and almond shaped palpebral fissures, short phil trum, thin upper lip and microstomia) were observed. At 15 months, the ASD was repared. He presented a convergent not paretic strabismus, the muscle tone was improved in general but the lower limb tone was increased when excited, the reflexes were symmetrical but exal ted and the CPR was extensor bilateral. We observed a limitation of joints extension which improved in subsequent controls. Now, at 41momths, he presented a global developmental delay with autistic traits. The aCGH (Nimblegen, 720K) performed defined a 60Kb deletion on 7q11.22, not seen in the aCGH (qChip R, 60K), and confirmed by MLPA in the AUTS2 gene.

It is generally quite difficult to have reliable estimates of the prevalence of rare genetic diseases as they may be often underdiagnosed and there are few efforts to have systematic data collection on a scale large enough to obtain significant numbers. Often numerical values are quoted either from rare ancient studies or even unreferenced. In the case of Bardet Biedl syn drome, a genetically heterogeneous disease, the numbers usually quoted are 1:125 000 to 1:160 000 for European populations. While Bardet Biedl syn drome can be caused by mutations in 19 currently identified genes (OMIM February 2015), two genes (BBS1 and BBS10) account for almost half the cases in European populations, and each of them have a major mutation, p.

23785,"Introduction: Bardet Biedl Syndrome (BBS; MIM 209900) is a recessive and genetically heterogeneous ciliopathy characterized by postaxial polydactyly, retinitis pigmentosa, obesity, hypogonadism, cognitive impairment and kid ney dysfunction. So far, 20 BBS genes have been identified, with the last ones reported being found in one or few families. Materials and Methods: Exome sequencing was performed in a consan guineous family in which two affected children presented typical BBS fea tures (retinitis pigmentosa, postaxial polydactyly, obesity, hypogonadism and cognitive impairment). BBS1 to BBS18 were sequenced by New Ge neration Sequencing (BBS1 to BBS16 ) and Sanger Sequencing (BBS17 and BBS18 ). Results: A missense mutation in IFT172 gene (NM_015662.2: c. 2857C>T , p. Arg953Cys) was identified at the homozygous state in the two patients and found at the heterozygote state in both parents and their 3 healthy child ren. IFT172 mutations have been initially reported in Jeune and Mainzer Saldino syndromes (Halbritter et al., 2014). Recently, mutations have also been found in isolated retinitis pigmentosa and Bardet Biedl like ciliopathy (Bujakowska and al., 2014). This is the second report of IFT172 mutations in BBS patients confirming IFT172 as a BBS gene. Moreover, another IFT gene, IFT127 , was already associated with Bardet Biedl syndrome (Aldahmesh et al., 2014) and this report confirmed the implication of IFT genes in the pa thogenesis of BBS.

23786,"Introduction: Bardet Biedl syndrome (BBS, #209900) is a rare genetic dis order considered a member of the group of ciliopathies. In recent years, zebrafish (Danio rerio) has been extensively used as a genetic model for the study of human disorders given the high homology that exists between human and zebrafish genomes (>80%). Here, we report an in vivo assay to analyse the functionality of three BBS5 variants, predicted to be pathogenic, which have been detected by WES or direct sequencing. Materials and Methods: Functional modelling of BBS5 variants was carried out using 8 10 somite stage embryos, previously microinjected with bbs5 MO at one to two cell stage. Non injected embryos were used as controls. We therefore performed rescue experiments with full length human mRNA (wild type and mutant, separately). Thus, affected embryos were classified according to severity of observed phenotypes. Results: As previously reported, zebrafish embryos injected with bbs5 MO manifested several gastrulation defects, such as curved body axis, kinked notochord, longer somites or partial loss of somite definition. These phe notypes, ranging from mild to more severe, seem to be rescued by using wild type human BBS5 mRNA, but not with mRNA carrying the detected mutations. Conclusions: Our preliminary results indicate that these mutations could cause defects that lead to an abnormal planar cell polarity (PCP) signalling, which is known to underlie certain clinical phenotypes in BBS patients.

23787,"Bardet Biedl syndrome (BBS) is clinically and genetically heterogeneous and overlaps with other ciliopathies. Mutations in about 20 genes are de scribed. BBS was among the first Mendelian disorders for which triallelic inheritance has been proposed which still causes uncertainty for genetic counselling and prenatal diagnostics. We performed genetic testing in 145 unrelated BBS patients, the most comprehensive sequencing based study to date. Initially, we tested for the BBS1 and BBS10 hotspot mutations . NGS using our panel for ciliopathies (currently targeting 381 genes) was perfor med in 81 patients. In all but three families who fulfilled the diagnostic cri teria, we identified homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations in a single BBS gene or ALMS1 . Most mutations were private, 50 were novel and not described so far. High coverage NGS enabled the detection of causative CNVs which were key to the diagnosis in hitherto unsolved constellations. As no MLPA kit is available for any of the BBS genes, all deletions would have been most probably missed by conventional techniques. Most patients carried additional mutations at other loci. However, in contrast to published data, our findings are in accordance with a recessive disease model. While modifiers may play a role for variable expressivity, our study widely resolves the long standing enigma of triallelic or oligogenic inheritance in BBS. More than 95% of typical BBS patients harbour pathogenic mutations in one of the known disease genes why we conclude that further genetic heterogenei ty is limited.

Heterozygous mutations in FBN2, which codes for fibrillin 2, are identified in about 27 75% of pa tients. In animal models,FBN2 is a key regulator of bone formation during embryogenesis. Case presentation: We describe a 2 year old boy, who is the second child of healthy non consanguineous parents. At birth,micrognathia, crumpled heli ces, pectuscarinatum, arachnodactyly and campodactyly of both hands and feet, flexion contractures of wrists, elbows and knees, and generalized mu scle weakness were noticed. Cardiac evaluation identified total anomalous pulmonary venous return and patent ductus arteriosus. Chest x ray showed bilateral fusion of multiple ribs. ArrayCGH did not identify pathogenic CNVs.

23789,"Introduction: Beckwith Wiedemann (BWS) is an overgrowth syndrome cha racterized by an unusual growth, macroglossia, hemihyperplasia, and other features as abdominal wall defects, major frequency of tumors compared with general population. Other clinical features are embryonic tumors, ad renocortical cytomegaly, ear anomalies, visceromegaly, renal abnormalities, neonatal hypoglycemia and polydactyly. The molecular basis of this syndrome is multifactorial, but the most com mon alterations are imprinting defects at 11p15.5 locus, which represents about 70% of the cases. Material and Methods: In this study, we analyzed KvDMR and H19DMR me thylation levels in 121 patients with BWS, 16 born by assisted reproductive techniques (ART) and 105 by natural conception. In 25 patients (15 from ART and 10 from Natural conception) we also analy zed several methylation imprinting loci: SRNPN, PEG1, ZAC, and GNAS. MS MLPA and pyrosequencing were applied to performed molecular analysis of the imprinting regions. Results: We found alterations in the locus 11p15.5 in 15 of 16 patients born by ART and 61 of 105 of patients born by natural conception. In addition, several patients born by assisted reproductive techniques presented defects in other imprinting loci. Conclusions: Imprinting defects in patients born after assisted reproductive techniques are nine times more frequent than patients born after natural conception. This defects may include more than one imprinting loci and the dysregulation of the epigenetic pattern are related to the development of imprinting disorders such as Beckwick Wiedemann. Thus, ART is related to the disruption of DNA methylation pattern. Grants: FIS: PI11/2491; MaratÃÂ³ TV3; EUCID COST Project(BM1208); Aso ciaciÃÂ³n EspaÃÂ±ola SÃÂ­ndrome de Sotos.",2015

It is caused by different epigenetic and genetic defects of the 11p15 region containing imprinted genes which are localized in two domains controlled by the imprinting control region IC1 and IC2.The aim of the study was to establish the molecular background of BWS in a group of 77 Polish patients. Molecular analyses were performed on leukocyte DNA and comprised methylation sensitive multiplex ligation dependent probe amplification (MS MLPA), microsatellite analyses, CDKN1C gene sequencing, and arrayCGH. The presence of 11p15 defects in 60 BWS patients, including a pair of monozygotic twins, was revealed. Hypomethylation at IC2 in 36 patients, hiper methylation at IC1 in 3 patients, and paternal UPD of 11p15 in 12 patients were identified. In other 7 patients aberrant methylation was associated with the pre sence of CNVs: duplications, a triplication or deletions involving both or one of the imprinted domains. In two patients novel frameshift mutations in CDKN1C gene were found. In the majority of cases genetic defects (CNVs, CDKN1C muta tions) were inherited and their effects depended on their size, localization and the parental inheritance. Overall, the study revealed the presence of epigenetic or genetic defects in 77% of investigated patients. The pattern of our molecular findings is comparable with other populations.

All patients exhibited clinical findings of overlap with typical CdLS patients, in particular harboring SMC1A mutations. Although SMC3 associated phe notypes are also characterized by postnatal microcephaly but with a less distinctive craniofacial appearance, a milder prenatal growth retardation that worsens in childhood, few congenital heart defects and an absence of limb deficiencies. Likewise some functional indications previously reported, our modelling of the mutation effects support the hypothesis that the mechanism of pathoge nicity in SMC1A and SMC3 related CdLS might be due to a dominant negative effect of the altered protein resulting from missense or in frame mutations.

In this work, we identify the centrosomal protein NINL as a physical interaction partner of CC2D2A through a yeast 2 hybrid screen. NINL parti ally co localizes with CC2D2A at the base of cilia and ninl knockdown in ze brafish leads to photoreceptor outer segment loss, mislocalization of opsins and vesicle accumulation, similar to cc2d2a / phenotypes.

Similar to zebrafish cc2d2a mutants, ninl morphants display altered Rab8a localization. Further exploration of the NINL associated interactome identifies MICAL3, a protein known to interact with Rab8a and to play an important role in vesicle docking and fusion.

Our case of Cockayne syndrome, type A (CSA), rare autosomal recessive disorder produced by ERCC8 muta tions, is an interesting example. The 8 year old girl, an only child of non consanguineous Russian parents originating from different regions, had pronounced delay of motor and especially of mental development, growth deficiency (100 cm, 13 kg), microcephaly (42 cm), typical face with deep set eyes, early hypohidrosis, ataxia, demyelinating polyneuropathy with feet de formity, atrophy and multiple small calcinates on brain MRI, and optic atro phy but no skin photosensitivity, deafness, retinal degeneration or cataract. Mutations in ERCC6 gene responsible for more severe CSB were not found. DNA test for CSA, which is not performed in our centre routinely, was plan ned. Meanwhile, CMA (Affymetrix CytoScan HD Array) was carried out in search of other possible diagnoses, and homozygous deletion of 5q12.1 was detected. Molecular karyotype: arr[hg19] 5q12.1(60,131,474 60,192,457)x0. The deletion had size 60983 bp and encompassed two genes, ELOVL7 (of no clinical significance) and ERCC8. Moreover, an increased number of long contiguous stretch of homozygosity (LCSH) 14% of genome was found. Both CMA findings are also strongly unusual for apparently non inbred fa mily. Homozygous deletion was confirmed by ALFP analysis of ERCC8 exon 12. Verified CSA diagnosis permits prenatal or preimplantation testing in the family and proper supportive medical care for the patient minding risk of immunological and other complications.",2015
23800,"Coffin Lowry syndrome (CLS) is an X linked mental retardation syndrome characterized by severe to profound intellectual disability and musculos keletal manifestations. Calcification of the yellow ligament (CYL) in early adulthood, resulting in myelopathy by spinal cord compression, had been previously reported in 3 CLS patients of Japanese origin. Here, we report on an additional 3 CLS patients with CYL: a 12 year old boy and a pair of 17 year old monozygotic twins. Ossification of the posterior longitudinal liga ment and of the yellow ligament both represents ectopic ossification in the cervical and thoracic spine region. This ossification is a common disorder among Japanese and other Asian populations, resulting in compressive mey lopathy and/radiculopathy in patients. Loss of function mutations in RSK2, a protein required for osteoblast differentiation and function, lead to CLS and are responsible for the skeletal abnormalities observed in CLS patients. Together with these results, the condition of CLS is likely accelerating the development of calcification in the ligaments and fascicles in our patients. Early detection and survey of this serious complication should be conside red in the management of CLS, especially for patients of Oriental origin.",2015

To understand the mechanisms involved in CS fat storage, we used two models of adipogenesis differentiation: (i) SGBS preadipocytes with VPS13B invalidation thanks to siRNA delivery and (ii) CS primary fibroblasts. In both models, VPS13B invalidation leads to an ac celerated differentiation into fat cells, which is confirmed by an earlier and an increased expression of specific adipogenic genes, consequently to an increase response of cells to insulin stimulation. At the end of the differen tiation protocol, these fat cells exhibit a decreased in AKT2 phosphorylation after insulin stimulation, in favor of insulin resistance. Thus, in association with the in depth analysis of the metabolic status of the patients, this study allowed us to recommend an appropriate nutrition education in order to prevent the occurrence of diabetes mellitus as well as recommendation for follow up of CS patients, in particular for metabolic syndrome development. We also preconize not to use the term obesity in CS, but abnormal fat re partition, which should limit the number of patients whom are addressed for CS diagnosis only on the basis of intellectual deficiency associated with obesity.",2015

Of the 139 patients with the most com mon type of CDH , the posterolateral, or Bochdalek type hernia , 85 (61.2%) had associated malformations. These included: chromosomal abnormali ties (n,25, 18.0%including 12 cases with trisomy 18); non chromosomal syndromes (Fryns syndrome, fetal alcohol syndrome, De Lange syndrome, CHARGE syndrome, Fraser syndrome, Goldenhar syndrome, Smith Lemli Opitz syndrome, multiple pterygium syndrome, Noonan syndrome, spon dylocostal dysostosis, and Beckwith Wiedemann syndrome); malformation sequences (laterality sequence, ectopia cordis); malformation complexes (limb body wall complex) and non syndromic multiple congenital anomalies (MCA) (n,36, 25.9%).

Opitz C Syndrome (OTCS) is an ultra rare disease with less than 60 patients diagnosed worldwide and a broad range of affectation, making its diagnosis very challenging. The OTCS gene/s has not been identified, yet. We recruited a cohort of 14 patients diagnosed as OTCS or C like syndrome, some with a Ã¢ÂÂtentativeÃ¢ÂÂ diagnosis. To search for the OTCS gene, 4 patients and their parents, including two brothers with an unclear phenotype, were subjected to whole exome sequencing (WES). While the WES sequences were being analyzed, a thorough clinical study of the older brother, including a muscle NMR, strongly suggested a congenital myopathy, rather than OTCS. The WES analysis revealed that the 2 brothers bore 2 mutations in the RYR1 gene, inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. The maternal mutation was a missense change (p. Cys489Phe), while the paternal was a nonsense mutation (p. Arg2241STOP) previously associated with congenital myopa thy and atypical periodic paralysis. The p. Cys489Phe mutation is predicted to be severely damaging by SIFT , PROVEAN and PolyPhen2. In addition, the Cysteine 489 residue is conserved among 33 vertebrate species and the nature of the amino acidic change and its position in a well defined alpha helix suggest that the correct folding of the RYR1 protein may be affected. However, further functional studies need to be performed to demonstrate its pathogenicity. WES is becoming a powerful tool in the molecular diagnosis of patients with unclear phenotypes, pathologies with an unknown molecular basis or in which very large genes (such as RYR1 with 106 exons) are involved.",2015

Cornelia de Lange syndrome (CdLS) is a genetically heterogeneous disorder manifesting extensive phenotypic variability. Mutations in NIPBL, SMC1A, SMC3, RAD21 and HDAC8, encoding subunits or regulators of cohesin, are found in about 70% of the patients. Next generation sequencing approaches have allowed us to identify hetero zygous de novo mutations in five patients with CdLS phenotypes who were previously negative for mutations in the CdLS genes. All five mutations alter chromatin associated factors and each is predicted to result in a loss of function. Two mutations, one nonsense and one 4 bp frame shift deletion, were found in the ANKRD11 gene, that is associated with KBG syndrome. The three other mutations disrupt components of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex, previously associated with Coffin Siris and Nicolaides Baraitser syndromes. These mutations include a missense substitution in SMARCB1, a frame shift deletion in ARID1A and a chromosome microdeletion including the ARID1B gene. Our results support recent molecular findings that describe an intimate link between cohesin and the SWI/SNF complex in regulating transcription. Furthermore, ANKRD11 associates with histone deacetylases to enable its role in transcriptional regulation. These findings add to the growing body of work supporting the hypothesis that CdLS and overlapping phenotypes result from alterations in specific gene expression patterns. In summary, mutations in ANKRD11 and components of the SWI/SNF com plex can result in clinical pictures that are difficult to distinguish from CdLS and related disorders. Thus, sequence analysis of these genes should be strongly considered for those patients with suspected clinical diagnoses of CdLS who were negative for CdLS associated genes.",2015
23807,"Cornelia de Lange Syndrome (CdLS) is a rare disorder characterized by a distinctive facial dysmorphism associated with growth delay, microcepha ly, mental retardation and limb anomalies. CdLS is caused by heterozygous mutations in genes encoding the core proteins of the cohesin complex or its regulators. Cancer genomics analyses have discovered a very high mu tation rate in Down syndrome associated acute megakaryoblastic leukemia (DS AMKL) suggesting that cohesin mutations may be the third genetic hit responsible for AMKL. Despite the potential role of cohesin in malignancy, increased tumor incidence in CdLS patients has not been described. We report the occurrence of AMKL in a 3 years boy with a clinical diagnosis of CdLS. Leukemic cells displayed the same morphologic and immunophe notypic characteristics found in DS AMKL blasts. Molecular and cytogenetic analysis revealed a frameshift mutation in GATA1 and trisomy 21 in the bone marrow blast cells. Analysis of a blood sample of the patient at the age of 3 weeks by exome sequencing identified a NIPBL mutation responsible for the CdLS but also revealed the presence, at a mosaic level, of the GATA1 mutation and trisomy 21 confirming that these defects which are primary events in DS AMKL are here, secondary events. This is the first report of leukemia in a patient with CdLS. The clinical im plication of this observation needs further investigations to determine wh ether cohesin mutations in CdLS patients may predispose them to cancer.

NIPBL represents about 60% of identified heterozygous mutations. The majority of cases results from a de novo event. Recently, NIPBL somatic mosaicism has been highlighted through buccal cell DNA study in some patients with a negative molecular analysis on leukocyte DNA. Materials and Methods: Here, we present a series of 38 patients with a Cornelia de Lange syndrome related to an heterozygous NIPBL mutation identified by Sanger sequencing. The diagnosis was based on the following criteria: 1) intrauterine growth retardation and postnatal short stature, 2) feeding difficulties and/or gastro oesophageal reflux, 3) microcephaly, 4) intellectual disability and 5) characteristic facial features.

As previously reported, the present series confirms the difficulty in predicting the phenotype according to the NIPBL mutation. Until now, somatic mosaicism has been observed for thirteen cases which does not seem to be consistently associated with a milder phenotype. Besides, several reports support a postzygotic event for those cases.<Conclusion: Considering these elements, we recommend a first line buccal cell DNA analysis in order to improve gene testing sensitivity in Cornelia de Lange syndrome and genetic counseling.",2015

CC malformations (CCM) are the most frequent brain malformations with an incidence of 1/4000 newborn often associated with chromosomal anomalies or mendelian syn dromes with recessive and dominant inheritance. Recurrence is observed in 5 % of cases. Children with CCM have an uncertain neuro developmental outcome. Therefore, counseling remains challenging, especially prenatally. We systematically reviewed the data of 142 fetuses with CCM as isolated or associated autopsy findings in our center. We first completed the cytogene tic analysis by a CGH array when the underlying etiology was not found: 108 (76%) of cases remained unsolved. In our effort to identify the disease causing gene of CCM antenatally, we used exome sequencing in 10 trios and a targeted high throughput sequencing strategy including 423 genes in 64 fetuses and 32 are ongoing.

Interestingly some diagnosis were not possible antenatally due to the absence of specific signs, but reevaluation of fetalpathological data (reverse phenotyping) allo wed to support NGS findings. These situations will be illustrated. All together, to date, as analysis are still ongoing, combined fetal imaging, fetal necropsy, cytogenetic and molecular analysis allowed the identification of the cause in at least 30 % of fetuses: 15% chromosomal anomaly and 15 % of mendelian disorder.

Our depart ment was among the first to implement exome sequencing in clinical genetic diagnostics. We show the results of WES for diagnosis of craniofacial anoma lies. Methods: Twenty patients with craniofacial anomalies (familial or syn dromic cleft lip/palate, oligodontia and craniosynostosis) were investigated by means of WES. WES was performed on an Illumina HiSeq2000TM plat form after enrichment with the Agilent SureSelect XT Human All Exon 50 Mb kit. A two step analysis was used in which a CFA gene panel containing 94 genes, based on the OMIM database and recent publications, was analysed first before opening the whole exome. Results: In the first step analysis, a genetic diagnosis was made in 5/20 index patients (25%). These comprised mutations in COL11A2 causing Stickler syndrome, in GLHR3 causing van der Woude syndrome type 2, and WNT10A mutations in oligodontia patients. Whole exome analysis in 11/15 patients diagnosed Kallmann syndrome, caused by a FGF8 mutation, in a family presenting with cleft lip/palate. Con clusion: With a diagnostic yield of 25% in the first analysis these results of the WES based CFA gene panel in a small patient cohort are promising. Having a genetic diagnosis allows optimal management and adequate ge netic counselling. Therefore we recommend that diagnostic WES should be offered to all patients with syndromic or familial forms of orofacial clefting and oligodontia.",2015

However, increasing the number of investigated trios has increased the power to detect and diagnose inherited conditions, including autosomal recessive disorders. The anticipated power of such big data is: 1) to enable the discovery of novel recessive genes, 2) to confirm the pathogenicity of new recessive genes with slight evidence in the literature, 3) to expand the phenotypic spectrum of known disease causing genes, 4) to shed light on pathways that are disrupted in a group of affected children. For example, several unrelated patients in our dataset were carrying rare loss of func tion and non synonymous biallelic mutations in different genes encoding Glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchored proteins. Two of these genes were recently identified and few patients have been reported in the literature. Therefore, our data endorse their pathogenicity and expand their clinical spectrums.

Causative mutations were found in 14 DDG2P genes (https://decipher.san ger.ac.uk/), confirming a range of syndromic diagnoses with associated DSD, including: KBG syndrome, Meier Gorlin syndrome, Alpha thalassemia/mental retardation syndrome, Kabuki syndrome and Donnai Barrow syn drome. Of these likely pathogenic mutations, 6 of 14 (43%) were found in DDG2P genes not previously associated with DSD. Conclusions: A range of DSD phenotypes are found in patients with neu rodevelopmental delay. Recognition of these associations should not be overlooked in the management of patients with complex conditions. Exomic sequencing through projects like DDD increases diagnostic yield whilst the identification of mutations in developmental genes may improve understan ding about the pathogenesis of DSD.",2015
23819,"ChildrenÃ¢ÂÂs Hospital Ljubljana, Department of Endocrinology, Diabates and Metabolic Diseases, 1000 Ljubljana, Slovenia. A 10 year old boy with speech delay, dysmorphic features, short stature, joint hyperlaxity, muscular hypotony and conductive deafness is presented. His father was diagnosed with X linked spondilopehyseal dysplasia tarda. Birth parameters were normal. In the first months he developed motor de velopmental delay with muscular hypotony. At one year short stature was diagnosed. Repeatedly he has been treated for mild middle ear infections and a conductive hearing loss was diagnosed at 10 years. At this age (height 130,67 cm ( 1.793 SDS); weight 28,25 kg ( 1.194 SDS); head circumference 55,5 cm (0.478 SDS)) he presented with two cafe au lait spots. Several dys morphic features were observed: long face, high vaulted palate, wide, retro verted nostrils, low set ears, tag on the lobule, deep philtrum, tented upper lip, joint hyperlaxity, proximal placed thumbs, wide spaced nipples and 2 3 toe syndactily of the both feet. The boy had difficulties in fine motor skills, concentration, attention and social skills. At the age of 11,5 years suspect of autism spectrum disorder was made.aCGH detected interstitial duplication of approximately 6.1Mb at 15q11.2q13.1 (arr[hg19] 15q11.2q13.1(22,765,628 28,940,098)ÃÂ3 mat), subsequently confirmed by FISH. Parental analyses identified the mother as a carrier of the same duplication. Several reports have suggested that maternally transmitted 15q duplicati ons were associated with autistic features with variable degrees of deve lopmental delay, while paternally derived cases presented with no major medical problems. Genetic counseling is vital to discuss the recurrence risks and options for prenatal and preimplantation genetic diagnosis in familial cases of 15q11q13 duplication.",2015
23820,"Background: Pure 16q duplications are rare chromosomal abnormality as sociated with dysmorphic features, intellectual disability, behavioral disor der and congenital anomalies. Even though the number of described cases is small, three main groups have been proposed: proximal (16q11 q13), proximal intermediate (16q21 16q22), intermediate distal (16.q23 q24) aberration, depending on the covered region of chromosme 16. Only 4 ca ses of the proximal intermediate 16q duplication have been reported so far, with no familial cases described. Report: We present a family of mother and two daughters, carrying duplica tion 16q12.1 q.22.1. Two year old girl was evaluated due to mild facial fea tures and delayed milestones. Her one year old sister manifesting distinct dysmorphic phenotype, evident developmental delay, hypotonia and obe sity was operated because of hypertrophic pyloric stenosis. Their mother displayed neither dysmorphia nor congenital defects but had moderate in tellectual disability. High resolution karyotype of peripheral blood lympho cytes showed additional material on the long arm of chromosome 10. Array CGH analysis revealed duplication of 16q12.1 q22.1, estimated to be 16.54 Mb in size. Additional FISH analysis confirmed that duplicated material was of chromosome 16 origin in both sisters and mother. Conclusion: The involved region contains 208 genes, some of which are known neurotransmitters, receptors or cell cycle regulators what is consi stent with clinical findings. Limited available data and varying size of du plicated region does not allow for reliable genotype phenotype correlation. Every newly described patient and family is a valuable contribution for a further delineation of phenotypic spectrum for those particular chromoso mal regions.",2015
23821,"Genetic variants in TERT and TERC are known to cause dyskeratosis conge nita (DC) and related diseases. These patients have impaired telomere elon gation causing stem cells to enter premature replicative senescence and/or apoptosis as telomeres become critically short. This explains the major im pact of the disease on highly proliferative tissues such as the bone marrow and skin. However, variants in TERC and TERT are not always fully penetrant and in some DC families disease causing variants are seen in asymptomatic family members. It is therefore challenging to determine whether a new va riant is pathogenic or not. Over the last three years we have identified 19 telomerase variants in patients with DC and related disorders. Analysis of these variants, taking into account familial segregation and functional stu dies, enabled us to categorise them into three groups; (a) disease causing, (b) bystanders and (c) status uncertain. Remarkably, these investigations identified families with disease causing variants where the mechanism of disease inheritance is novel; one family has triallelic mutations in both telo merase genes and in two families an epigenetic like mechanism is at play. We have constructed a diagnostic algorithm which may be useful for the ca tegorisation of uncharacterised telomerase variants in the future. This study therefore highlights that telomerase variants have highly variable functio nal and clinical manifestations and require thorough investigation to assess their pathogenic contribution.

23822,"The clinical presentation of dyskeratosis congenita (DC) and its allelic vari ants encompass a wide range of features including abnormal skin pigmen tation, nail dystrophy, leukoplakia and bone marrow failure. Pathologically DC is characterized by selective exhaustion of highly proliferative cells that have critically shortened telomeres. To date causal mutations in ten telome re biology genes have been identified. Through whole exome sequencing on uncharacterized DC patients, we iden tified biallelic variants in four families in the genes DNAJC3, GRHL2, LIG4 that have been associated with other diseases (APCHD, Ectodermal dysplasia, Li gase IV syndrome, respectively) which have overlapping clinical phenotypes with DC. This raises the question, if these variants are disease causing as we believe, then how wide is the phenotype of dyskeratosis congenita? The table emphasises the large degree of clinical overlap seen in these pa tients with the diagnostic spectrum of phenotypes seen in DC as well as the diseases associated with the causal variants. These patients were referred with a suspected diagnosis of DC but based on the identified mutation, an al ternative diagnosis should be considered. Telomere length tends to be short in most DC patients but is normal in these individuals. The outcome from this exome sequencing project highlights the difficulty in assigning a clinical label to a highly variable disease phenotype. It also suggests potential biolo gical overlap of DC with other syndromes.

23823,"Dysmorphology concerns the recognition and management of rare, multiple anomaly syndromes. Genomic technologies and software for gestalt reco gnition will re shape dysmorphology services. In order to reflect on a model of the service in the post Genomic era, we compared the utility of dysmor phology consultations in two Mediterranean cities, Athens, Greece and Afu la, Israel (MDS), the Manchester Centre for Genomic Medicine, a UK service with dysmorphology expertise (UKDS) and the DYSCERNE, digital service (DDS). We show that it is more likely that Chromosome Microarray Analy sis will be performed if suggested in the UKDS rather than in the MDS; this most probably reflects the difference of access to genetic testing following funding limitations in the MDS. We also demonstrate that in terms of achie ved diagnosis, the first visit to a dysmorphology clinic is more significant than a follow up. We show that a confirmed syndrome diagnosis significant ly decreases the requests for other, non genetic, laboratory investigations. Conversely, it increases the requests for reviews by other specialists and, most significantly (t test 8.244), it increases further requests for screening for possible associated complications. This is the first demonstration of the demands, on a health service, following the diagnosis of a dysmorphic con dition.

23825,"Single gene disorders are a common cause of morbidity and mortality in in fants. Diagnosis can be challenging as the clinical presentation is frequently undifferentiated or incomplete in the early stages. Individual disorders are rare, and often genetically heterogenous. This commonly results in extensi ve, protracted, costly and invasive diagnostic investigations in this patient group. We prospectively evaluated exome sequencing as a first tier molecular test in 37 infants suspected of having a monogenic disorder. All participants were less than 2 years of age, and 40% were less than 3 months of age. Infants with pathogenic CNVs and those who had previously undergone singe gene sequencing were excluded. Exome sequencing with targeted phenotype driven analysis occurred in parallel with standard investigations, including single gene Sanger sequencing when clinically indicated. The most common indication for testing was the presence of multiple congenital abnormalities and dysmorphic features (54%), followed by suspicion of a neurometabolic disorder (20%). Exome sequencing resulted in a molecular diagnosis of 21 genetic conditions in 20 infants, giving a diagnostic rate of 54%. Four rela tives received a genetic diagnosis following cascade testing, and 10 couples were identified as being at high risk (25% or 50%) of recurrence in future pregnancies. By contrast, a molecular genetic diagnosis was reached in 20% using standard approaches in the same patient group. Employing exome sequencing as a first line molecular test in selected in fants has the potential to considerably shorten the diagnostic process, im prove diagnostic yield, guide management, and enable accurate recurrence risk counselling in a timely manner.",2015
23826,"Eyebrow abnormalities are relatively rare birth defects that could be highly suggestive for the diagnosis of multiple congenital anomalies (MCA) syndro mes. To confirm this hypothesis, we have selected 84 cases from our own experience with marked eyebrow abnormalities. All patients had a specific diagnosis confirmed with genetic tests in most of the cases. We have identi fied different types of eyebrows based on specific criteria like facial distribu tion, sparseness, thickness or uniformity. The most common abnormalities in our group were diamond shaped eyebrows (32% of cases), synophris (18% of cases) and sparse eyebrows (17%), whereas the least common ABSTRACTS POSTERS ESHG 2015 | GLASGOW, SCOTLAND, UK | WWW.

Each eyebrow pattern has been associated with specific syndromes and based on our own experience and literature data we have identified for every pattern the most commonly associated clinical features, making the association highly suggestive for the diagnosis. Clinical data will be illustrated with pictures. In conclusion, we appreciate that Clinical Genetics still has a place within the Genomic Era, the recognition of suggestive clinical features being very useful for MCA diagnosis in developing countries, where financial resources are limited and detailed molecular testing is not always available in daily practice. This leads to a more specific diagnosis and increases the cost effec tiveness of genetic testing.",2015
23827,"We have identified PIEZO1 mutations that cause a form of autosomal reces sive GLD which is characterised by a high incidence of non immune hydrops fetalis and chronic peripheral primary lymphedema. This may be lethal in utero or in the neonatal period. However, it may fully resolve and present later in childhood with four limb lymphoedema with facial oedema and a susceptibility to facial cellulitis with intermittent swelling. Some of the pati ents have intestinal lymphangiectasia or pleural effusions. Whole exome sequencing was performed in three families and novel vari ants in only one gene, PIEZO1, were identified under the criteria of an auto somal recessive disease. The whole coding region of the gene was Sanger se quenced in 10 unrelated individuals of similar phenotype. In total, we have identified nine homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations in six unrelated GLD families; three nonsense, four missense, and two splice site mutations. The missense mutations were located in evolutionary conserved residues and predicted to have damaging effects on the protein. The splice variants caused exon skipping and the nonsense mutations affected PIEZO1 expression. RT PCR and western blot were used to investigate the effect of the identified variants on gene and protein expression. A skin biopsy was investigated and lack of initial lymphatics was found. Mutations in PIEZO1 have previously been reported to cause autosomal dominant DHS but our report suggests that biallelic mutations in this gene cause GLD. Therefore, it suggests that PIEZO1 has a role in the development of lymphatic structures. This work was supported by the BHF, the Newlife Foundation for Disabled Children and the NIH.",2015
23828,"The oculoauriculovertebral spectrum (OAVS, OMIM 164210) or Goldenhar syndrome is a developmental anomaly involving the first and second bran chial arches. This pathology represents one of the most common congenital craniofacial disorder, with a prevalence around 1/26,000 births. Main fea tures include facial asymetry resulting from maxillary and/or mandibular hypoplasia, hemifacial microsomia, unilateral or bilateral ear anomalies, ocular defects, and vertebral malformations. To date, although various chromosome abnormalities have been associated with OAVS and several candidate genes have been screened, the genetic etiology of this pathology remains largely unknown. For the present study, a project with national recruitment established a co hort of 156 patients with OAV spectrum. In order to determine the molecu lar basis of Goldenhar syndrome, we performed exome sequencing in trios including selected patients with Goldenhar syndrome and their healthy parents. We identified a nonsense mutation in GOLD1 gene, a poorly cha racterized transcription factor known to be involved in ear development. Screening of the cohort identified a missense mutation in a second patient. Interestingly, GOLD1 belongs to a genetic environment within a paralogon that was already involved in another Copy Number Variant associated with OAVS. Functional studies by transient knockdown in zebrafish model evi denced gold1 as craniofacial cartilages architecture key factor.

23831,"Insulin like growth factors I (IGF I) is essential for pre and post natal soma tic growth and cellular proliferation. The binding of IGF I to IGF1R leads to receptor autophosphorylation resulting in recruitment of cytoplasmic com ponents of multiple downstream signalling pathways, including the PI3K/Akt and MAPK/Erk pathways, which are important for cell survival and cell growth. Here, using exome sequencing, we identified and characterized a new ho mozygous c.2201G>T mutation in the IGF1R gene in a female patient, born from consanguineous parents, showing very high IGF I levels and clinical features of SHORT syndrome plus developmental delay, CNS defects, and marked progeroid appearance. This mutation cosegregated in the hetero zygous state in the parents and other relatives, which show a milder phe notype. Based on a bioinformatics analysis, the c.2201G>T mutation was predicted to cause an alternative splicing event that we confirmed by RT PCR followed by direct sequencing of amplified products. This event causes an aberrant isoform that adds 25 aminoacids after the proline at codon 733, predicted to be damaging and causing dramatic structural changes of the protein. Functional studies using primary dermal fibroblast cultures obtained from affected and healthy individuals revealed a lower IGF1R protein expression in both homozygous and heterozygous fibroblasts. Furthermore, decreased IGF 1R content affects IGF I signalling, as showed by a reduction of IGF I dependent Akt phosphorylation and IGF IR auto phosphorylation.

Array CGH (aCGH) enables genome wide investigation of copy number chan ges at high resolution and have recently been implemented as a clinical dia gnostic tool. In this study, a high resolution oligonucleotide chromosomal microarray was applied in an Iranian cohort of 220 patients with DD/ID and multiple congenital anomalies: male;114, female:116, aged 7days 20 years. DNA extracted from peripheral blood cells were analyzed with CytoChip_ ISCA_4x180 oligo array. The imbalances were confirmed by FISH or MLPA. We considered copy number variants (CNVs) as pathogenic if the variant was responsible for a known syndrome, encompassed gene/s of known function, occurred de novo or, if inherited, the parents was variably affected and/or the involved gene/s had been reported with DD/ID and multiple congenital anomalies. aCGH identified 39 clinically significant microdeletions and 18 microduplications in 23.6% (52/220) patients, with size of aberrant regions ranging from 39kb to 24.2Mb. 26.3% (15/57) of the copy number variant (CNV) detected corresponded to well known microdeletion and microdupli cation syndrome (Williams, Digeorge, prder Willi, kabuki, WolfHirschhorn, Tar, Reiger, Potoki lupski and Mitochondrial complex deficiency IV syndro me). 61% (35/57) of the detected CNVs were de novo, 26% (15/57) inhe rited and 12% (7/57) unknown. We also identified two novel CNVs, one at 9p11.2 p13.1 and the other at 10p12.1 as a pathogenic submicroscopic CNV.

We determine the increased diagnostic yield and provide a thorough cost analysis of the clinical care prospectively with WES compared retrospectively to care without WES. Materials and Methods: Seventeen children of healthy, unrelated parents were randomly selected from the 2011 patient population at the Sylvia Toth Center (STC; Utrecht, the Netherlands), a specialized center for children with complex neurological disorders and diverse phenotypes. WES was per formed on Illumina HiSeq 2500. In parallel, the clinical records of patients were obtained and a comprehensive cost summary of medical treatments, hospital visits, and all other resource use was compiled per patient. This cost was then compared to the cost of care using WES, assessed prospectively. Results: The diagnostic yield in this patient cohort is 18%, confirming past studiesÃ¢ÂÂ diagnostic yields on intellectual disability cohorts. The three mu tations detected are in genes recently associated with intellectual disabi lity (ANKRD11, CTNNB1, ANDP), and the mutations are all heterozygous de novo frame shift deletions resulting in protein truncation. In addition, strong candidate genes (HNRNPU, CHD4) have been identified. Conclusions: The increased diagnostic yield and fractional increase in total overall price in the cost of care for these patients suggests that WES should be implemented early in patient care for similar centers that have patient populations for whom providing a diagnosis is both difficult and expensive.",2015

23836,"IntroductionKabuki Syndrome (KS; OMIM 147920) is a congenital anomaly/intellectual disability syndrome caused by a mutation in the KMT2D or KDM6A gene. Children with KS have a spectrum of clinical features, one of the key features is postnatal growth deficiency. Mutations in KMT2D gene, encoding an H3K4 histone methyl transferase, act as an epigenetic transcriptional activator during growth and develop ment. As for the KDM6A mutation, no molecular cause for growth retarda tion has been described. GH deficiency has been reported in KS but in the majority of children with KS no cause for small stature has been found. We studied the growth hor mone and IGF I pattern in order to learn more about a possible mechanism involved in this postnatal growth retardation. MethodsCurrently, we have assessed 15 KS children (age 3 10 years old, 6.44ÃÂ±2.29) with a known KMT2D or KDM6A mutation. Height was variable, with a mean height SDS of 2.38 ÃÂ±1.41. Both clonidine (CLO) and arginine (ARG) were used for stimulation. GH and IGF 1 were measured according to inter national standard. Results and ConclusionGrowth hormone deficiency was present in 4 of 15 (26.67%) children. Ap parently growth hormone deficiency is not the only cause for small height in KS patients. In addition, in 2 children the GH tests showed a tendency to GH resistance, although no one actually met the defined criteria. Further re search is necessary to determine the underlying cause of growth retardation in the majority of KS patients. Currently we are performing a clinical study with growth hormone in child ren with Kabuki syndrome; the results are pending but promising.",2015
23837,"Kapur Toriello syndrome (KTS) is a rare multiple congenital abnormalities syndrome first described by Kapur and Toriello in 1991. We present a new case, taking the total number reported in the literature to six. With gradual expansion of the cohort, evidence is emerging for several key features including bilateral cleft lip / palate, a distinctive nose, low set ears, ocular, cardiac, intestinal and brain malformations. Other features seen less commonly in previous cases, but which our case adds evidence for, include growth retardation, digital abnormalities, short stature and a short, wide neck. Structural pituitary abnormalities associated with growth hormone defici ency have not been previously reported in patients with KTS, although short stature and growth retardation have been frequently noted. To our know ledge, our patient is the first with KTS to receive growth hormone therapy. It would therefore seem appropriate to monitor growth hormone levels in patients with KTS presenting with short stature. Autosomal recessive inheritance has previously been suggested. As this is the fourth case with a single affected individual born to non consanguineous parents, it raises the possibility of autosomal dominant inheritance.

Mutations and deletions of the ANKRD11 gene are known to cause KBG syndrome. We report a series of 20 French patients with KBG syndrome including 3 families. Molecular anomalies consisted of 9 mutations and 8 deletions involving at least part of the ANKRD11 gene. The 9 mutations were identified by targeted sequencing of the gene, following clinical diagnosis of KBG syndrome. The age at diagnosis ranged from birth to 65 years. All mutations were loss of function and were clustered in the largest exon. The size of deletions ranged from 127kb to 1.2Mb. There were no significant clinical differences between mutated and deleted cases. Facial gestalt was characteristic in all cases, and allowed the diagnosis even in young children. Deafness was present in 25%, short stature in 55%. Interestingly, the teeth were considered as normal in 3 adult patients and two patients exhibited a caudal appendage. In most patients, intellectual level ranged from borderli ne intelligence to mild/moderate intellectual deficiency. A single patient had severe ID. Two had epilepsy and behavioral problems were noted in 20%. From an epidemiological point of view, our study confirms the high rate of familial cases. All cases with a mutation were recruited from two French centers, whereas the 8 16q24.3 deletions identified by array CGH deletions were recruited through a national network. We postulate that mutations are probably more frequent than deletions but remain undiagnosed. Diagnosis is clinical on the basis of typical facial features and similarities with Cornelia de Lange syndrome may be striking.",2015

Microcephaly with or without chorioretinopathy, lymphoedema, or mental retardation (MCLMR) (MIM #152950) is a rare autosomal dominant con dition. The causative gene, kinesin family member 11 (KIF11) was identi fied in 2012. KIF11 mutations were found in individuals with and without lymphoedema. To further delineate this condition, we collected the clinical details of thirty seven individuals from twenty two families, all with KIF11 mutations. The condition arose de novo in 40% of cases where parental results were available. In our cohort, 86% had microcephaly, 78% had an ocular abnor mality consistent with the diagnosis, 46% had lymphoedema, 73% had mild moderate learning difficulties, 8% had epilepsy and 8% had a cardiac anomaly. We identified three individuals with KIF11 mutations, but no cli nical features of MCLMR demonstrating reduced penetrance. The variable expression of the phenotype and presence of mildly affected individuals indicates that the prevalence may be higher than expected, and we would therefore recommend a low threshold for genetic testing. Our data suggests that mutations in KIF11 cause a variable spectrum of clini cal features. Not only is the microcephaly variable, the ocular abnormalities are also variable with chorioretinopathy being the most prevalent. Recently a series of cases with retinal detachment mimicking FEVR have been repor ted suggesting a broader spectrum of ocular manifestation than originally suggested. Our review will explore and summarise the relationship between the KIF11 genotype and some of the major, phenotypic characteristics of MCLMR identified to date. This work was funded by BHF.",2015
23840,"Meyer, University of Firenze, Florence, Italy. Introduction: Lissencephaly (LIS), the most severe malformation of neuro nal migration, is characterized by broad or absent gyri and abnormally thick (12 20 mm) cortex. Several patterns and syndromes are known including the less severe variant subcortical band heterotopia (SBH), but rapidly in creasing knowledge requires revision of the current classification. Materials and Methods: We reviewed brain scans, clinical and molecular fin dings for 129 LIS patients ascertained from 2009 2014 and grouped them by severity (LIS grade 1 6), gradient (diffuse vs. anterior or posterior), and presence of other malformations. Results: Posterior predominant LIS grade 3 (27%) followed by diffuse LIS or SBH (17%) due to mutations of LIS1 and DCX were the most common forms. All other LIS patterns were less frequent (2 9%) with anterior predo minant forms significantly less frequent than posterior predominant forms. Recognizable tubulinopathies accounted for 10% of patients (grade 4 LIS with atypical mixed pachygyria microgyria). This is the only group lacking the consistent anterior or posterior gradient characteristic of LIS. In additi on, we recognized a novel anterior predominant Ã¢ÂÂthinÃ¢ÂÂ LIS (cortex 5 7 mm; normal is 3 4 mm) with reduced number of gyri and shallow sulci. When combined with severe cerebellar hypoplasia this variant is caused by muta tions in RELN or VLDLR. However, 8 patients had Ã¢ÂÂthinÃ¢ÂÂ LIS with a normal cerebellum. None had mutations in the known LIS genes. Based on high per centage of homozygosity in SNP arrays in several of these patients, we stron gly suspect autosomal recessive inheritance. We will present more detailed diagnostic criteria and updated results of molecular testing.",2015
23841,"Malformations of the brain cortex development (MCD) are rare di seases diagnosed by MRI scan and are classified into proliferation disorders(microcephalies and megalencephalies), disorders of neuronal migration (lissencephaly, cobblestone malformation and heterotopia) and disorders of cortical organization (polymicrogyria and schizencephaly). Identification of many genes has improved etiological diagnosis, but genetic heterogeneity makes testing of individual genes unpractical. In Rotterdam a diagnostic custom made panel for high throughput sequencing of 103 genes involved in MCD, belonging to all three ategories has been developed. About 168 patients have been tested in two years. Most of the patients had no mu tation in one or more candidate genes (e.g. LIS1, DCX, FLNA, ARX, GPR56 ), previously tested by Sanger sequencing. The diagnostic yield of the panle ABSTRACTS POSTERS ESHG 2015 | GLASGOW, SCOTLAND, UK | WWW. ESHG. ORG 224Back to inde x was about 6%. Most diagnoses have been achieved in the group of primary microcephalies, and the least in the group of polymicrogyria, although the latter was the most common indication for the test. Expert post test clinical and radiological re phenotyping has led to reclassification of the disease, broadening the phenotypic spectrum of known disorders, as for mutations in the small nuclear RNA coding RNU4atac, for ACTB, KIAA1279 , CENPJ and RELN. Diagnoses also included cases with insufficient radiological data for appropriate classification. Low abundance mosaic mutations, e.g. TUBB2B and PIK3R2 that we observed, remain a challenge to detect. When applied as first tier test, targeted NGS panels can be cost effective for the diagnosis of MCD, without the drawbacks of unsolicited findings. However these preli minary data underpin the etiological heterogeneity of MCD and the need for collaborative research efforts.",2015
23842,"INTRODUCTION: Meckel Syndrome (MKS) is a genetically heterogeneous recessive ciliopathy presenting in fetal life with multiple malformations, of which occipital encephalocele is the most characteristic. MKS type 9, caused by B9D1 mutations, is a rare entity with only two published cases so far, and none of them had a skeletal phenotype. MATERIALS AND METHODS: An unrelated couple lost four fetuses due to malformations consistent with MKS. Fetal DNA was collected from CVS or spleen and subjected to 6.0 SNP array based copy number analysis, ha plotype analysis, and finally whole exome sequencing (WES) analysis of a ciliopathy related gene panel. Whole body X ray was performed on fetus 4.RESUL TS: 6.0 SNP array and Sanger sequencing of the MKS1 gene were nor mal. Fetus 1 and 2 shared haplotypes around NPHP3, TMEM67, B9D1, and B9D2. Only in B9D1 compound heterozygosity for pathogenic variants were detected by the ciliopathy panel and later verified by Sanger sequencing. Ultrasound and X ray examination of fetus 4 displayed angulated tibiae and radii and a large calvarium. CONCLUSION: Only four patients with a ciliopathy due to B9D1 mutations have so far been described, two with MKS and two with Joubert syndrome (JS). Here we expand the severe end of the phenotypic spectrum of B9D1 mutations, adding skeletal dysplasia to the list of possible manifestations.",2015
23843,"A boy was born at term from non consanguineous parents with a birth weight of 2130 gr ( 3 SD), length of 45 cm ( 2.5 SD) and OFC of 30.5 cm ( 4 SD). Pregnancy was complicated by oligohydramnios and IUGR. Facial dys morphism was noted at birth including blepharophimosis, stubby nose and thick columella, mild retrognathia, and posterior cleft palate. Cerebral ima ging showed bilateral cysts of the choroid plexus and mild enlargement of the cerebral ventricle. Auditory evoked potentials suggested sensorineural deafness. He had subsequent developmental delay and growth retardation. Hypsarythmia occurred at age 9 months. He died from status epilepticus. His young brother, born at term with a birth weight of 3090 gr ( 0.8 SD) and OFC of 31.5 cm ( 3.5 SD) had similar dysmorphism, including blepharophimosis and cleft soft palate. Subsequently, he presented severe developmental delay, feeding difficulties and gastro esophageal reflux. Seizures appeared at the age of 1 year. Aged 13.8 year, his weight is 15.0 kg ( 4 SD), height 111 cm ( 6 SD) and OFC 44.5 cm ( 7 SD). He is unable to walk or speak. Clinically, the se patients, originally reported as blepharophimosis MR syndromes, share similarities with Juberg Marsidi syndrome. Array CGH was normal. Whole exome sequencing identified a hemizygous mutation in a gene located in Xp11.22, affecting a highly conserved amino acid, and predicted, in silico, to be pathogenic. This mutation was present in both siblings, the mother and maternal grand mother but absent in another male maternal relative. X chromosome inactivation and functional studies are currently underway.

23844,"Mutations in KIF11 cause microcephaly with or without chorioretinopathy, lymphoedema, or mental retardation (MCLMR, MIM #152950) which is a rare autosomal dominant condition. MCLMR can be de novo or inherited. The phenotype is variable, often displaying mild to severe microcephaly plus any of the following: ocular abnormalities, lymphoedema, and learning difficulties. This report further expands the molecular spectrum of KIF11 variations. Previous investigations have identified and reported a total of 50 cases. We have screened another cohort of 28 unreported, unrelated MCLMR subjects for mutations in KIF11 by Sanger sequencing. We found 15 mutations in 17 subjects; one variant had previously been reported. A variety of mutations were identified including a synonymous mutation (c.2922G>A) in two un related subjects, which we show has an impact on splicing. This is the first report of a synonymous mutation in KIF11 being responsible for causing disease. Identifying further mutations in this gene supports the role of KIF11 as con tributory to MCLMR. A review of the spectrum of mutations in the KIF11 mu tation positive subjects in this cohort and all published cases (i.e. a total of 67 cases under review) shows that nonsense mutations were most common (33%), followed by frameshift mutations (27%), missense and splice site mutations (20% each). The mutations are distributed evenly throughout the KIF11 gene. No mutations were identified in 11 unrelated individuals with clinical features consistent with MCLMR, suggesting genetic heterogeneity associated with this condition.

23845,"Interstitial deletions of chromosome band 5q31 are rather uncommon, only several patients have been reported to date. We report on a case of a 12 year old girl patient with a de novo 4.19Mb interstitial deletion of chromo some bands 5q31.1 q31.2 detected by whole genome oligonucleotide mi croarray analysis. Clinical manifestations in this patient included: failure to thrive, psychomotor retardation, short stature, muscular hypotonia, skeletal anomalies, microcephaly, cleft palate, hand and foot anomalies and dysmor phic features. Overlapping microdeletions have been previously reported [Rosenfeld et al., 2011: DECIPHER 249028; Kleffman et al. 2012].In these patients microdele tions were rather larger (5.0 8.1Mb) and extend distally into 5q31.3. Carri ers of larger microdeletions which include subbands 5q31.1 and/or 5q31.3 seem to be more severely affected with congenital malformations, growth anomalies, and severe encephalopathies. No common occurrence of the smallest region of overlap has been observed. Compared to the previously reported patients, severe feeding difficulties, weakness and fatigue of calf muscle and unusual tiredness are unique features only to our patient, which might be due to different sizes and positions of the individual deletions. In conclusion, this case increases our knowledge of phenotypic conse quences of interstitial 5q31 deletions. There has been considerable inte rest in mapping the smallest region of overlap for this syndrome in order to identify the critical pathogenic genes and establish genotype phenotype correlations.

ORG 225Back to inde x States, 6Department of Genetics, Groningen University Medical Center, Groningen, Netherlands, 7Department of Pediatrics Surgery, Erasmus University Medical Center, Rotterdam, Netherlands. Introduction: Megacystis microcolon intestinal hypoperistalsis syndrome (MMIHS) is a rare congenital disease characterised by severe dysfunctions of the bladder and the intestine. Recently, mutations in the enteric smooth muscle actin ÃÂ³ 2 (ACTG2) have been associated with MMIHS. ACTG2, one of the six actin isoforms, is specifically expressed in smooth muscle cells of the enteric organs. Materials and Methods: In order to confirm the involvement of ACTG2 in MMIHS development, we sanger sequenced a cohort of sporadic MMIHS pa tients to determine mutation frequency, and further investigated the mole cular pathogenesis associated with ACTG2 mutations by performing a series of in vitro assays and molecular modelling analyses. We also investigated whether these mutations lead to histopathologic abnormalities, and for that we performed immunohistochemistry on intestinal tissue from patients and controls. Results: Our results showed that heterozygous ACTG2 mutations were present in all MMIHS patients included in this study. We also determined that the identified mutations inhibited ACTG2 incorporation into the actin filaments, and contributed to reduce contractility. Molecular modelling of ACTG2 mutants confirmed our results, and showed significant changes in the protein structure that likely affect polymerization of ACTG2. Finally, by immunohistochemistry we detected ACTG2 expression in all intestinal lay ers formed by smooth muscle cells in different stages of human embryonic development. Interestingly, no histopathologic abnormalities were found in patients. Conclusions: Taken together, our data confirmed that ACTG2 mutations cause MMIHS and showed that reduced incorporation of ACTG2 into actin filaments affect contractility, and therefore underlies the pathogenesis of MMIHS.",2015
23847,"Distal 10q deletion syndrome is a well characterized chromosomal disorder consisting of neurodevelopmental impairment, facial dysmorphism, cardiac malformations, genital and urinary tract defects as well as digital anomalies. Patients with interstitial deletions involving band 10q26.1 present a pheno type similar to the ones with the distal 10q deletion syndrome, which led to the definition of a causal 600 kb smallest region of overlap (SRO).In this report, we describe a male patient with an interstitial 4.5 Mb deletion involving exclusively the 10q26.1 segment. He had growth and psychomo tor retardation, microcephaly, flat feet, micropenis, and cryptorchidism. The patientÃ¢ÂÂs deleted region does not overlap the 10q SRO. We reviewed the cli nical phenotype of patients with similar deletions and suggest the presence of two new SROs, one associated with microcephaly, growth and psychomo tor retardation, and the other associated to genital anomalies. Interestingly, we narrowed those regions to segments encompassing five and two genes respectively. FGFR2, NSMCE4A, and ATE1 were suggested as candidates for facial dysmorphism, growth cessation, and heart defects respective ly. WDR11 was linked to idiopathic hypogonadotropic hypogonadism and Kallmann syndrome. Its haploinsufficiency could play a crucial role in the genital anomalies of these patients.",2015

23849,"Progressive myoclonic epilepsy encompasses a syndrome of myoclonic seizures and progressive neurological decline caused by a group of rare genetic disorders including lysosomal storage and mitochondrial diseases. The associated aetiological heterogeneity of progressive myoclonic epilepsy poses a diagnostic challenge, yet the application of high throughput sequen cing technologies has allowed the identification of rare causal variants in Mendelian diseases such as these. Sodium valproate is a common anticon vulsant drug that is used therapeutically in epileptic disorders, but has been associated with Fanconi syndrome, particularly in severely disabled indivi duals who are tube fed. We discuss the case of an 8 year old Pakistani boy, with a complex phenotype of myoclonic epilepsy with severe myopathy, se vere developmental disability, Fanconi syndrome, pyrexia of unknown ori gin and a family history of Leigh syndrome. An initial clinical diagnosis of a mitochondrial disorder was made and supported by a marginally decreased level of complex V within the electron transport chain on muscle biopsy. Mi tochondrial DNA tests revealed no mutations in m3243A>G or m8344A>G, yet mitochondrial DNA depletion showed an intermediate result of 44% of mean normal levels. Genomic DNA was extracted and sent off for whole exo me sequencing and was analysed using an in house pipeline. Despite a prior hypothesis that our patient had a mitochondrial disorder, we identified a causal variant in KCTD7 (p. Leu108Met) which provided a diagnosis of pro gressive myoclonic epilepsy type 3. This enabled us to reflect on our prior hypothesis and infer the cause of his Fanconi syndrome to be secondary to valproate therapy.",2015

It is a form of acrofacial dysostosis characterized by craniofacial and limb anomalies. Mutations in the SF3B4 gene have been confirmed as the cause of this condition in most affected individuals. We report the case of a female neonate with an antenatal diagnosis of dia phragmatic hernia, severe micrognathia and polyhydramnios. At birth addi tional features of cleft palate and ventricular septal defect were noted. The severe micrognathia was associated with temporomandibular joint ankylo sis requiring a tracheostomy. Other salient craniofacial features included low set ears with bilaterally small external auditory meatus and down slanting palpebral fissures. No significant upper limb abnormalities were detected. A previously unreported heterozygous frameshift mutation (c.1175dupC) in exon 6 of the SF3B4 gene was identified by exome sequencing, confirming a diagnosis of Nager syndrome. Diaphragmatic hernia has been described in only three previous cases of Nager syndrome, two of which had a confirmed molecular diagnosis. There fore, this case adds evidence to suggest that diaphragmatic hernia should be considered to be a rare feature of the condition. In addition, our case is unusual in exhibiting no significant upper limb anomalies.

Essential features found in NBS were microcephaly, typi cal face, immunodeficiency, chromosomal instability, and a highly increased risk for malignancies. We report three siblings with NBS, born to nonconsanguineous parents. The patients presented with obvious microcephaly, bird like face, cafÃÂ© au lait spots and normal intelligence.

The majori ty of the breaks involved four fragile sites on chromosomes 7 and 14 7p15, 7q36, 14q12, and 14q32. Immunological studies demonstrated a marked decrease in both B and T cell number and function. Mutation screening of the NBS1 gene revealed that children were homozygous for the 657del5 al lele in exon 6, their parents are heterozygous for the same mutation. First child died at 8 years of age from pneumonia. Second child had no hi story of recurrent infections. Third child had recurrent gastrointestinal and pulmonary infections since birth.

Oculo auriculo vertebral spectrum (OAVS) is a rare congenital disease cha racterized by aural, oral, mandibular and vertebral defects often associated with cardiac, pulmonary, renal, skeletal, and central nervous systems ano malies. The etiology of OAVS is still unknown. A number of chromosomal abnormalities containing genes potentially involved in the disease patho genesis has been described. In the current study, we used a high density Affymetrix SNP 6.0 array platform to evaluate the contribution to OAVS of rare submicroscopic chromosomal anomalies. Minimal diagnostic criteria for inclusion in the study were the presence of at least three of the following clinical characteristics: hemifacial microsomia, ear anomalies and preauri cular pits or tags. A total of 60 subjects (34 females and 26 males) including 55 sporadic and 5 familial cases were studied. Thirty rare copy number va riants (CNVs), ranging from 100 Kb to 1 Mb, were identified in 27/60 indi viduals. Of these, four had de novo origin in sporadic patients, whereas thir teen had been inherited from an unaffected parent. None of detected CNVs was listed in the database of genomic variants as well as in 80 ethnically matched Caucasian control subjects. Despite none of the identified CNV was recurrent, three independent chromosomal aberrations contained genes in volved in the Pax Six Eya Dach regulatory network. Current results suggest that individually rare CNVs are collectively significant contributors to the genetics of OAVS. Moreover, the CNVs detected in the present study suggest a number of OAVS candidate genes that warrant further investigation.",2015

23857,"Introduction: Morning glory disc anomaly (MGDA) is a congenital abnorma lity of the optic disc reported as an isolated condition or associated with various anomalies including basal encephalocele and moyamoya disease. However the co occurrence of these three entities is rare and the pathoge nesis is still poorly understood. On the contrary Oral Facial Digital Syndro me type 1 (OFD1; OMIM 311200) is a well recognized X linked dominant developmental disorder belonging to ciliopathies. Among brain structural anomalies in OFD1, both sphenoidal encephalocele and moyamoya disease have never been reported. Materials and Methods: The only child showed bilateral MGDA and colo boma, sphenoidal encephalocele, moyamoya disease and mild clinical fea tures of OFD1.Results: Sequence analysis of OFD1 gene detected a novel hemizygous mis sense variant, c.1081T>C, resulting in p. Tyr361His mutation change. Conclusions: Similarly to other ciliopathies, inactivation of Ofd1 transcript is associated with defective Sonic hedgehog (Shh) pathway. Ofd1 inactivati on in zebrafish produces several malformations including retinal coloboma, whereas in mutant mouse it exerts a crucial role in developing of forebrain through the regulation of Shh signaling. On the other hand Shh is a criti cal pathway yielding a pleiotropic effects in many developmental proces ses such as in modulating the closure of the buccohypophyseal canal and the vessel formation. Here we report the first case of bilateral MGDA and coloboma, sphenoidal encephalocele and moyamoya disease due to a novel missense mutation in OFD1 gene contributing to expand the phenotype of OFD1. Moreover we speculate on a possible pathogenic role of OFD1 gene in patients with moyamoya disease, basal encephalocele and MGDA.",2015
23858,"The PCSK1 gene was within the first genes implicated in the literature in severe early onset obesity. Autosomal recessive congenital PCSK1 deficien cy was shown to cause neonatal diarrhea and midchildhood severe obesity. Recently Philippe et al. (2014) also reported nonsense mutations in PCSK1 likely causing dominantly inherited human obesity. We now report on a father and son with haploinsuffiency of PCSK1 without obesity. The 2 year old boy was referred to our outpatient clinic because of psychomotor developmental delay. In the boy and his father we detec ted the microscopically balanced translocation : 46,XY, t(5;12)(q15;p13.1). By chromosomal microarray analyses (CMA) there was a deletion of about 157kb in the chromosomal band 5q15 encompassing the PCSK1 gene. The translocation was de novo in the father with behavioural problems in school and epileptic seizures in childhood until puberty. When we saw the boy at the age of 17 months his measurements were within the normal percentiles. The paternal grandmother reported the psychomotor development of the boy as comparable with the one his father had. The BMI of the father at the age of 40 was 25.2 kg/m 2. The only gene deleted by CMA in this family was PCSK1. This gene is up to now not reported to be involved in developmental delay. The breakpoint on chromosome 12p13, however, may be responsible for the borderline deve lopmental delay in this family: possibly involved gene: GRIN2B (12p13.1, mental retardation, autosomal dominant 6).In our family there was a haploinsufficiency of PCSK1 and definitively no obesity supporting recessive inheritance of obesity in PCSK1 defects.",2015
23859,"We present a detailed prenatal and postnatal clinical description and exten ded DNA analyses in a case of Penta X syndrome diagnosed in a newborn girl. The pregnancy was uneventful until gestational age (GA) week 28, there were normal fetal ultrasonographic examination at GA 13+1 weeks, and no abnormalities diagnosed at the 20 weeks prenatal anomaly scan. At week 28 polyhydramnios was suspected leading to extra prenatal scans. Which revealed polyhydramnios, dilated intestines, suggesting possible intestinal atresia, IUGR with 23,1% to 30,7% weight deviation and short femora ( 2,8 SD). Because of suspected brain sparing the birth was initiated at GA 38+3 weeks and the girl was born with a birth weight of 2,484 g. She had hypertelorism, abnormal configuration of the ears, cleft palate (in the soft palate), bilateral single transverse palmar creases, bilateral clinodac tyly, short lower limbs compared to the rest of the body, mild hypotonia and a shrill animal like cry. Echocardiography showed mild stenosis of the right pulmonary artery and mild coarctation of aorta, none of which were thought to have clinical significance.

23860,"Pierre Robin Sequence (PRS) comprises micrognathia, cleft palate, glosso ptosis and upper airway obstruction affecting 1 in 6000 neonates, often resulting in airway and feeding difficulties. Although syndromic forms of Pierre Robin Sequence are well known, the full phenotypic spectrum of non syndromic PRS is less defined. We sought to provide an accurate phenoty pic characterisation of a large cohort of 141 non syndromic Pierre Robin Sequence patients managed at the Royal ChildrenÃ¢ÂÂs Hospital in Melbour ne from 1985 to 2012. We categorised patients into either Ã¢ÂÂIsolated PRSÃ¢ÂÂ (n,83) or Ã¢ÂÂPRS PlusÃ¢ÂÂ (n,58) groups. Patients in the PRS Plus group had ad ditional anomalies beyond the craniofacial system, with the musculoskeletal and ocular systems most commonly involved. Choanal stenosis/atresia was the single most common co existing craniofacial malformation. Compared to those with isolated PRS, PRS Plus patients had worse outcomes at birth and during the neonatal period, with a higher proportion being born small for gestational age, have failure to thrive and require surgical intervention for airway and feeding. A subset of patients with a family history of cleft and/or a musculoskeletal anomaly was selected for targeted DNA sequen cing of the SOX9 conserved non coding elements (CNEs) at chromosome 17q24. In one patient with PRS, talipes equinovarus and pectus excavatum, a single nucleotide substitution was identified in CNE1, at a consensus GATA1 transcription factor binding site; however the functional significance of this variant is currently being investigated.",2015
23861,"Here, we report the case of a girl who presented with hyperplasia of the lower extremities, macrodactyly, and multiple lipomatosis. We made a cli nical diagnosis of PIK3CA related overgrowth, which was subsequently confirmed by direct gene sequencing. The patient was born to healthy un related parents at 39 weeks of gestation. At birth, she presented with enlar ged syndactyl toes, a broad foot, and a mass in her inguinal region. Her feet rapidly increased in size to almost twice the average size, and more so for her left foot. Adipose tissue was reduced in her upper extremities and torso. She underwent surgery several times to reduce adipose tissue in order to manage overgrowth. The patientÃ¢ÂÂs phenotype differed from that of Proteus syndrome, Klippel TrÃÂ©naunay Weber syndrome, and CLOVES syndrome as follows. Her facial appearance was symmetric and nondysmorphic, over growth was limited to the lower extremities, her skin showed no nevi or he mangiomas, and no cerebriform skin was observed on hypertrophic regions (characteristic of Proteus syndrome). Histological analysis of the resected tissue revealed mature adipose tissue of normal morphology. We identified the patient as having the recently proposed clinical entity PROS (PIK3CA related overgrowth spectrum). Using direct sequencing, a PIK3CA mutation (p. His1047Arg) was identified in DNA obtained from dissected hyperplasic adipose tissue; this was absent in DNA obtained from her blood lymphocy tes. Significant activation of Akt/mTOR signaling was also observed in the patientÃ¢ÂÂs adipose tissue. This report contributes to the dysmorphological diagnosis of the phenotypic spectrum of mosaic PIK3CA mutations.",2015
23862,"Mutations in the PIK3CA gene have been found to cause several conditions related to overgrowth of tissues. These conditions include disorders of the brain such as Megalencephaly Capillary malformation syndrome (MCAP) and hemimegalencephaly as well as segmental body overgrowth disorders like fibroadipose hyperplasia or Congenital, Lipomatous, Overgrowth, Vas cular Malformations, Epidermal Nevi and Spinal/Skeletal Anomalies and/ or Scoliosis syndrome (CLOVE). PIK3CA associated disorders are caused by postzygotic activating mutations which are present in the mosaic form pri marily in affected tissues of the body. The most frequent somatic mutations in PIK3CA identified in overgrowth syndromes occur in exons 9 and 20 (oc casionally referred to as exons 10 and 21). We routinely sequence exons 9 and 20 of PIK3CA using both Sanger and Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) methodologies. Here, we present our diagnostic strategy for a patient referred with clinical features suggestive of MCAP syndrome. Molecular analysis performed on DNA extracted from blood of the MCAP patient has produced results which required subsequent evaluation. Identification of a low level somatic mutation is challenging and may require more than one tissue to be tested. Moreover lack of detection of a mutation in PIK3CA gene does not exclude the clinical diagnosis of PIK3 CA associated disorders due to limitations in detecting mosaicism from dif ferent tissue samples. Results of further investigation of this case together with the potential role of NGS technologies in a diagnostic strategy for mosaic disorders will be presented.",2015
23863,"Introduction: The main clinical features of Prader Willi Syndrome (PWS) are hypotonia, hyperphagia, obsesity, hypogonadism, short stature, small hands and feet, mental disabilities, and behavioral problems. Signs and symptoms of PWS could also be found in patients who show other types of chromoso mal abnormalities, among others Temple Syndrome (mat14UPD).Materials and Methods: We report a case referred for genetic study with clinical suspicious of PWS due to the presence of hypotonia, hyperphagia, mood fluctuations, temper tantrums and developemental delay. 15q11 MS MLPA test was normal so 14q32 MS MLPA was carried out. Microsatellites of 14q32 region, CGH array and FISH study were analysed. Finally, deep ge nome sequencing of the 14q32 region was performed. Results: The patient showed a gain of methylation and copy at MEG3 DMR. The microsatellites study revealed that the patient presented both paternal and one maternal chromosomes. FISH study of the patient pointed out that added copy could have been incorporated in tandem. CGH array and deep sequencing of the region revealed the exact boundaries of the insertion of the genomic extra material. Parents showed no (epi)genetics alterations of this region, so de novo origin was inferred. Conclusions: We report a patient with an interstitial trisomy of 14q re sulting from the insertion of part of 14q32 region of the paternal allele. It seems that the rearranged genomic segment was flanked by homologous low copy repeat (LCR) structures. These LCR could have acted as recombi nation substrates for non allelic homologous recombination, leading to the gain of dosage of the region analyzed.

Conclusions: Somatic mosaic mutations of GNAQ cause Sturge Weber Syn drome which may include intellectual disability. In DECIPHER, intellectual disability and speech delay have been reported in many patients with larger deletions on 9q21 overlapping with FOXB2, VPS13A, GNA14, GNAQ and in a patient with a deletion involving last exon of GNA14 and first two exons of GNAQ. Thus, disruption or haploinsufficiency of GNAQ and GNA14 may be related to intellectual disability. In addition, these changes may also be asso ciated with primary amenorrhea and visual loss, because GNAQ and GNA14 play role in GnRH, estrogen, relaxin, androgen, serotonin and visual signa ling pathways. However, it should be considered that the other breakpoints may also contribute to the phenotype.",2015
23865,"Hutchinson Gilford progeria syndrome (HGPS; OMIM #176670) is an extre mely rare premature and accelerated aging disease which affects 1 in 4 8 million children with symptoms resembling normal adult aging, including growth impairment, thin skin, loss of subcutaneous fat, alopecia, osteoporo sis and cardiovascular disease leading to shortened lifespan and death at a mean age of 13.5 years. HGPS is caused by a de novo point mutation (c.1824 C>T , p. G608G) within exon 11 of the LMNA gene encoding A type lamins. This mutation activates a cryptic donor splice site in exon 11 that leads to the deletion of 50 amino acids at its carboxy terminal domain, resulting in a truncated and permanently farnesylated prelamin A called progerin. Ac cumulation of progerin is a hallmark of HGPS that affects the integrity of the nuclear scaffold, leading to nuclear blebbing and functional defects in cultured cells. We show that progerin is sequestered, together with other proteins (lamins B1/B2, emerin), into abnormally shaped Promyelocytic Nuclear Bodies (PML NB), identified as novel biomarkers in Progeria. MG132, inhibiting proteasome activity, induces progerin nucleocytoplasmic translocation after a transition through the nucleolus, and progerin degra dation through macroautophagy. MG132 also strongly reduces progerin production through caspase linked cleavage of SRSF 1 controlling prelamin A mRNA splicing. In vivo, through MG132 treatment, progerin expression decreases in skeletal muscle from LmnaG609G/G609G mice. Altogether, we demonstrate progerin clearance based on MG132 dual action and shed the light on a promising class of molecules towards an encouraging therapy for Progeria and related diseases.",2015
23866,"Background: Cowden syndrome is an autosomal dominantly inherited tu mour predisposition syndrome with a prevalence around 1/200 000 in the European/USA population. It is associated with increased risk of developing malignant tumors including breast, thyroid and endometrial cancer. Germ line mutations in PTEN gene are considered an underlying cause of the di sease. However, 37% of mutation carriers do not fulfill clinical diagnostic criteria for any defined syndrome, and therefore a wider phenotype could be associated with pathologic mutations in PTEN. Purpose: This study aimed to describe the comprehensive clinical pheno type associated with PTEN mutations, to examine potential genotype/phe notype correlations, and to evaluate the relevance of currently used clinical diagnostic criteria. Method: A systematic review of published cases and observational articles was undertaken and clinical characteristics of described cases were com piled. Results: 297 articles and abstracts describing 682 presumably unique indi viduals were identified in the study. Clinical traits included in established criteria for PTEN related syndromes occurred with high frequency. Patients with germline PTEN mutation displayed mixed polyposis as well as vascular malformations, and several novel traits were noted similar to observations seen in mouse models of PTEN deficiency. Germ cell/gonadal malignancies were significantly more prevalent among the study population compared to general population. Further, Cowden syndrome appeared to be diagnosed more frequently among females, and Bannayan Riley Ruvalcaba syndrome more frequently among males, potentially resulting from gender weighting in the diagnostic criteria. Conclusion: The phenotype associated with PTEN mutations seem to be wi der than believed, and further study is needed for understanding the pre valence of novel clinical characteristics among mutation carriers and their ramifications.",2015

Patients and methodsMutation analysis of 14 genes associated with Rasopathies (PTPN11, SOS1, RAF1, BRAF, KRAS, HRAS, NRAS, MAP2K1, MAP2K2, SHOC2, CBL, NF1, RIT1 and SPRED1) was performed by Sanger and target sequencing using the Ha loPlexTM Target Enrichment System on MiSeq sequencing platform in 48 patients from Central Europe Slovakia (18), Slovenia (20), Hungary (3), Czech republic (2) and Austria (5). Patients were selected according to the scoring questionnaires oriented to the main clinical features of Rasopathies. Data were analyzed by ChromasPro and SureCall softwares.

23868,"Introduction: Ring 22 chromosome is a rare chromosomal aberration, with only ~100 cases reported and no consistent clinical picture. We present 3 cases with variable clinical phenotypes: RPM, microcephaly, hypotonia, ata xia. Materials and Methods: Chromosomal analysis was done from cultured cells of PHA stimulated lymphocytes from blood and cultured skin fibroblasts using GTG banding. Specific characterization of marker chromosome was done using multicolor fluorescent in situ hybridization (M FISH).Results: Two patients had aberrant karyotypes: 46,XX,r(22)(p12q13) and 46,XY,r(22)(p12q13), respectively. Third patient had aberrant mosaic ka ryotype: mos 46,XY,r(22)(p12q13)[44]/46,XY,dic r(22)(p12q13[6]). Cy togenetic analysis from this patientÃ¢ÂÂs skin fibroblasts showed presence of only one clone: 46,XY,r(22)(p12q13)[52]. Clinical features in patients with ring22 can be associated with 22q13.3 syndrome (Phelan McDermid syn drome) since the formation of ring22 is followed by terminal deletion of p and q arms. The last described patient had cells with dic r(22) causing presence of three copies of 22p12 22q13.2 region in minority (6/50) of pe ripheral blood lymphocytes. This aberration still might account for the CES (cat eye syndrome) features since it may have been present at a much higher frequency early in development and then subsequently lost. Conclusion: Our report emphasizes the importance of cytogenetic and mole cular cytogenetic approach in order to better understand the spectrum of abnormalities in each case, and assess genotype phenotype correlation.",2015
23869,"Noonan syndrome (NS), a RASopathy which exhibits genetic and phenoty pic heterogeneity, has been associated with germline mutations in 14 genes related to the RAS/MAPK signaling pathway, including recently discovered RIT1 gene encoding a small GTPase from the RAS superfamily. We present 6 new unrelated NS patients of Polish origin with 5 different pa thogenic substitutions in conserved domains of RIT1: p. Ser35Thr, p. Ala57Gly, p. Ala77Ser, p. Phe82Leu, p. Gly95Ala. De novo occurrence has been confirmed in 4 cases, whereas p. Ala77Ser was identified in the patientÃ¢ÂÂs father, who also presented with NS phenotype. In our molecularly defined group of NS patients RIT1 mutations constitute ~8% (6/76). The clinical findings of our study largely agree with the literature, as the patients exhibited typical NS features, however, without intellec tual disability, additionally, only 2/7 had short stature. It is worth no ting that 4/6 patients suffered from postnatal lymphedema and other lymphatic disorders. Cardiac anomalies occurred in 4/7 individuals. The patient with p. Phe82Leu mutation died early due to the severe hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. In the affected father with p. Ala77Ser substitution terato ma maturum testis has been identified. Our results, together with the recently published data concerning 4 other Polish individuals, introduce the largest group of NS patients of Caucasian origin with RIT1 mutations. They contribute to the further delineation of molecular and clinical profile of RIT1 related NS and underline that RIT1 , as the third most frequently affected gene in NS, should certainly be included into the diagnostic panels screening for RASopathy disorders.

Two sisters from a Turkish consanguineous family presented with primary microcephaly ( 8 SD), short stature of prenatal onset ( 5 SD), behavioral is sues, and intellectual disability. Their facial features were suggestive of Seckel syndrome. Homozygosity mapping (using Affymetrix 6.0 SNP arrays) identified 5 regions; 1p34.2, 2q22.2 2q22.3, 3p24.1 p24.2, 7q31.1 q32.3 and 18q21.33q22.3. No known Seckel genes are located within these regions. With whole genome sequen cing (Complete Genomics) the homozygous DOCK4 c.3470G>A variant was identified, leading to a putatively deleterious amino acid substitution (p.

DOCK4, dedicator of cytokinesis 4, encodes a Rac1 guanine ex change factor (GEF), which is involved in the PDGF dependent cell migration through modeling of the actin cytoskeleton. DOCK4 is highly expressed in brain and during embryonic development and it has been proposed to play in role in neurite differentiation and extension. We stimulated fibroblasts from one of the affected individuals with PDGF BB, and stained the fixated cells with the F actin marker rhodamine phallodoidin. This showed a poorly organized actin network in patient fibroblasts compared to control cells. A PDGF responsive migration assay on patient cells is pending.

Other associated anomalies have been described such as malposition and herniation of other abdominal organs. We report the case of a baby girl born prematurely (29wog) due to poly hydramnios. She presented IUGR, craniofacial dysmorphism, median cleft lip and short neck. She had a midline diaphragmatic hernia, a very short oesophagus. The stomach, spleen and part of the pancreas were located in the thorax. She was also diagnosed with a large rachischisis from cervical to thoracic spine, with major defect of the anterior arches and a cyst of the spinal cord. The lobulation of the lungs was abnormal. Both the echocardio gram and the transfontanellar ultrasound were normal. Most of these mal formations have been observed prenatally. SNP array was normal. She died at age 12 days.

We report on a new born baby boy with asphyxia, narrow thorax and severe hypotonia initially suggesting a neuromuscular disease. The muscle biopsy showed myopathic changes with prominent variability in muscle fibre size and abnormal expression of developmental isoforms of myosin. The myofibrils showed focal loss and disorganization of myofilaments and thickening of the Z discs including some abortive nemaline rods. The boy became permanently dependent on assisted ventilation. Pancreatic insufficiency has subsequently been eviden ced explaining the malabsorption and failure to thrive.

SGBS is caused by deletions, duplications and point mutations in GPC3, encoding a membrane associated cell surface heparan sulfate pro teoglycan named glypican 3. GPC3 plays essential roles in regulation of cell growth signaling and cell division. Several large intragenic deletions of GPC3 detected by array CGH and PCR analysis of genomic DNA but so far not on mRNA level have been reported. Here we report on a family with three affec ted cousins who display typical clinical features of SGBS, such as overgrowth, accessory nipples, hypertelorism and ID. By initial microarray CGH we iden tified a deletion of approximately 30 50 kb that includes at least one exon of GPC3. By subsequent Sanger sequencing of genomic DNA we could map the chromosomal breaking points to define a deletion of 43,617 bp including exons 6 and 7 of the GPC3 gene. RT PCR analysis on RNA derived from whole blood could further confirm the deletion of both exons on transcript level. This loss of two exons results in a frameshift and a premature stop.

The sibs, 3 and 5 years old, presented pre and postnatal growth retarda tion, developmental delay with predominant speech impairment, hypoto nia and joint hyperlaxity, happy demeanor but no clear walking difficulties. Physical evaluation showed relative macrocrania, prominent maxilla, pectus excavatum, flat feet. Considering parental consanguinity and a difficult differential diagnosis, whole exome sequencing was performed, which led to the identification of a novel homozygous variant c.892dupA in the SPG20 gene in both affected sibs. This variant causes a premature stop codon in spartin, the protein en coded by SPG20. Parents are heterozygous carriers of this variant, that is absent from large control databases (ESP , ExAc). Mutations in SPG20 have been reported in Troyer syndrome, an autosomal recessive disorder, mainly characterized by progressive spastic paraparesis, pseudobulbar palsy, distal amyotrophy, developmental delay, and short sta ture, with onset in early childhood. A neurologic examination, performed after this finding, showed lower limb muscular hypotrophy with mild distal hypertonus and intra rotated feet when running in both sibs. The mutation therefore seems causative of the patientsÃ¢ÂÂ phenotype. Even if it is a rare condition, Troyer syndrome should be considered in pa tients with syndromic short stature (SRS like) and developmental delay, for prognostic and counseling issues.",2015
23876,"Potocki Lupski syndrome (PLS) is usually caused by the chromosome 17 duplications at 17p11.2. However, there are rare cases of this syndrome ori ginating from chromosome rearrangements producing partial trisomy 17p encompassing the critical region. Here, we present a 4 year old girl with a developmental delay, language impairment, symptomatic epilepsy, beha vioral problems, congenital corneal opacity of the right eye, and dysmorphic features mimic PLS facial appearance. Cytogenetic analysis has revealed a supernumerary marker chromosome. Molecular cytogenetic analysis by SNP array molecular karyotyping and FISH has indicated this marker chro mosome to be derived from chromosome 17. This small supernumerary marker chromosome (sSMC) was detected in about 60% of cells. SNP array and FISH showed approximately the same percentages of abnormal cells. Molecular karyotyping has shown that sSMC was composed of a genomic re gion corresponding to 17p11.2q11.1 (8.5 Mb) and affected 164 genes. sSMC was larger than commonly reported duplications (3.7 Mb). In the available literature, there have been only 3 reports describing supernumerary Ã¢ÂÂmar kerÃ¢ÂÂ chromosomes 17 in PLS. Interestingly, the present case exhibited a de rivative chromosome affecting larger genomic region as to those previously reported. The latter seems to be key explanation of clinical manifestati ons additional to PLS phenotype. Finally, this case exemplifies that sSMCs addressed through SNP array and FISH represent an attractive perspective for genotype phenotype correlations.

Supernumerary ring chromosomes cause genomic imbalance and can be as sociated to an abnormal phenotype depending on the gene content. It is im portant to identify and characterize the extra chromosome composition in order to perform phenotype genotype correlations. Only thirteen patients with a supernumerary pericentromeric ring (7) chromosome have been reported to date. Among them, language delay and poor expressive speech performance are frequently reported. We report a patient with a de novo supernumerary r(7) chromosome present in 56% of lymphocytes, found by conventional cytogenetic analysis in a 19 years old girl referred for low IQ, disturbed behaviour and a peculiar facial phenotype. Subsequent array CGH analysis detected a 25 MB duplication encompassing the pericentromeric region 7p11.2 7q21.11. Based on the array CGH results, the gene content of the r(7) chromosome was determined. The 7q11.23 region included in the ring chromosome has been associated to the Williams Beuren syndrome when deleted (OMIM #194050) and to the duplication 7q11.23 syndrome (OMIM #609757). This duplication causes a recognizable phenotype charac terized by language delay and mild craniofacial anomalies, showing variable expressivity. In some cases, the genetic imbalance is inherited from one of the normal parents. Clinical assessment of our patient showed some minor facial dysmorphisms, such as a narrow flat front, almond shaped palpebral fissures, small mouth, thin lips and pointed chin, besides a central obesity. Psychological tests disclosed an IQ in the low limit of normality, showing va riable performances in different areas. Aggressive behaviour and low social skills were also noted.

Introduction: Thalidomide remains infamous for being a teratogen, cau sing severe damage to embryos exposed during early pregnancy. Remarkab ly Thalidomide is currently used to successfully treat conditions like Lepro sy complications and Multiple Myeloma worldwide. Yet, surprisingly, how thalidomide caused teratogenesis is still not fully resolved. Many theories have been put forward, some of the widely accepted ones include induction of oxidative stress, angiogenesis inhibition and disruption of Cereblon E3 ubiquitin ligase complex which may alter molecular pathways involving de velopmental genes resulting in thalidomide embryopathy (TE). Objective: To identify if genetic variants of susceptibility to TE in developmental genes can be detected in subjects with TE. Methods: We compared the allelic and genotypic frequencies of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in several important signalling molecules that have multiple roles in embryogenesis, specifically, FGF8, FGF10, BMP4, SHH and TP53 genes in 28 TE subjects to 68 non TE subjects from the Brazilian population without congenital malfor mations. All DNA samples were genotyped by Real Time PCR and all the ne cessary ethical consents were obtained. Results: For the genes looked at in this study we did not identify differences in genetic frequencies between the TE and control group. Conclusions: We did not, at this time, identify genetic susceptibility to TE for the evaluated variants. However, we have only used a small sample size and a limited number of gene targets, to validate this approach. We are looking at other potential targets using the same metho dology to help in understanding of molecular mechanism of teratogenesis. Funding: CNPq, CAPES and FIPE HCPA.",2015

Herein, we report a young girl who presented with persistent macrothrombocytopenia and a developmental delay. A physical examinati on showed distinctive facial features with microcephaly. She communicated with simple words. She was able to identify colors and to name objects. She had an intention tremor and fell while attempting a tandem gait.

23880,"The ciliary transition zone (TZ) is thought to control ciliary formation, composition and signaling by facilitating a protein diffusion barrier at the ciliary base, and TZ defects are associated with ciliopathies such as Meckel Gruber syndrome (MKS), Nephronophthisis (NPHP) and Joubert syndrome (JBTS). Here, using a co expression/evolution profiling approach to uncover candidate TZ genes, TMEM107 was identified as a new TZ protein muta ted in patients with oral facial digital syndrome type VI (OFD VI) and JBTS. Mechanistic studies in C. elegans roundworms reveal TMEM 107 functions redundantly with NPHP 4 to regulate cilium integrity, TZ docking and the assembly of TZ membrane microtubule Y link connectors. Consistent with evolutionary and mammalian biochemical analyses, TMEM 107 occupies an intermediate layer of the nematode TZ localised MKS functional module and organises the TZ recruitment of a distinct transmembrane submodu le including TMEM 17, TMEM 231 and JBTS 14/TMEM237. Furthermore, transmembrane MKS module proteins including TMEM 107 are immobile within the TZ membrane and display ring like super resolution localisation patterns reminiscent of the ciliary necklace. Thus, TMEM107 is a ciliopathy constituent of an anchored ring like domain of the TZ membrane and orga nises a discrete transmembrane component of the C. elegans MKS module.",2015
23881,"Trisomy 10p is a rare, complex syndrome of mental retardation and multip le congenital malformations caused by the partial or total duplication of the short arm of chromosome 10. This abnormality may be a de novo occurrence or may be inherited from a carrier parent. Most cases appear because of an unbalanced segregation of famililal chromosomal translocations that result in trisomy 10p associated with other additional segmental imbalaces. We describe three cases of non mosaic trisomy 10p resulting from familial translocations: two sisters with a complex cytogenetic anomaly consisting in 10p trisomy and a rare subtelomeric 2p25.1 deletion and one other unrelated girl with 10p trisomy, without any apparent additional geno mic imbalance (46,XX,der(2)t(2;10)(p25.1;p11.1)mat and, respectively, 46,XX,der(14)t(10;14)(p11.1;p11.1)mat). The inheritance and identity of the translocations were ascertained by extensive familial cytogenetic and FISH studies. The few tens of patients with trisomy of the short arm of chromosome 10 re ported to date have shown variable clinical manifestations. The clinical pre sentation for the girl with der(14) (10 days old) is very similar to that found for pure trisomy 10p reported in the literature, with facial dysmorphism, congenital abnormalities, hypotonia and severe developmental delay. For the two sisters with der(2) (ages 1y 4mo and 8y 1mo), the phenotypic features slightly overlap those previously described for trisomy 10p, with additional clinical characteristics, probably due to the accompanying mo nosomy.

Trisomy 13 (T13) is characterized by multiple congenital anomalies, severe developmental delay, and a short life span with the 1 year survival rate as 5 10 % and the median survival time as 7 days through population based studies. Management of T13 is controversial, supposedly due to the lack of precise clinical information of this syndrome especially on efficacy of treatment. To delineate the natural history of T13 managed under intensive treatment, we reviewed detailed clinical data of 22 patients with full T13 admitted to Nagano ChildrenÃ¢ÂÂs Hospital from 1994 to 2014.Major clinical findings included congenital heart defects (91%), cleft lip or cleft palate (68%), polydactyly (59%), and cryptorchidism (50% of male). 19 patients received resuscitation by intubation and required Mechanical ventilation. Of these, six were extubated and 11 needed tracheostomy. A to tal of 29 surgical interventions except for cardiac surgery were performed on 15 patients. Enteral feeding was accomplished in 19, six of whom were fed orally. Eight patients could be discharged home. The survival rate at age 1 week, 1 month, and 1 year was 100%, 95%, and 41%, respectively. Median survival time was 271 days (range, 22Ã¢ÂÂ3987). Common final modes of death were congenital heart defects and heart failure (50 %). These data were si milar to those obtained in patients with trisomy 18 in our hospital [Kos ho et al., 2006].This study has demonstrated improved prognosis through intensive treatment, which would be helpful for clinicians to offer the best information on treatment options to families of patients with T13.",2015

Subsequently, chorionic villus sampling (CVS) was per formed for conventional chromosomal analysis. After direct preparation the CV trophoblast cells showed a numerically normal female karyotype (46,XX), whereas after long term culture all analysed CV mesenchymal core cells showed a numerically abnormal female karyotype with tetraploidy (92,XXXX).Fetal ultrasonography at 17 th week of gestation revealed persistent nuchal edema, bilateral clubfeet and a generally petite developed fetus.

Four subtypes are described (WS1 4), type 1 and 2 being the most frequent and 3 the rarest. WS1 is caused by he terozygous mutations in PAX3, a transcription factor playing a key role in neural crest cells and muscle development. More than one hundred muta tions have been published. Two homozygous mutations in PAX3, leading to hindlimb defects (WS3), were also described. Here we document 2 consecutive severe cases of WS with fetal presentation. Ultrasound found increased nuchal translucency, lack of active movements, club hands and feet, and neural abnormalities. Both pregnancies were me dically interrupted due to the severity of the phenotype. We identified in both fetuses a homozygous missense mutation within PAX3 homeodomain, shedding light on the molecular basis of this very rare form of WS. The con sanguineous parents are heterozygous for the mutation and present with a classical form of WS1.In vitro experiments were carried out to confirm the deleterious effect of this mutation. We found that PAX3 activation ability on the MITF promoter, alone or together with SOX10, was crippled by the mutation. While the cellu lar localization of the protein was not affected, the mutation clearly interfe res with the trans acting activity of PAX3 and thus inhibits it from activating downstream targets in the neural crest pathway.",2015

Introduction: Williams Beuren syndrome (WBS) is known as a multisy stem disorder caused by the deletion of several genes on chromosome 7 (7q11.23). We have used specific facial anomalies, intellectual disability, cardiac abnormalities, and hypercalcemia as diagnostic selection criteria, and used multiple ligation dependent probe amplification (MLPA MRC Holland) analysis to confirm the diagnosis. Materials and Methods: We have analyzed 24 patients confirmed with WBS, and identified 5 cases related to a familial disorder and 19 isolated cases. We have analyzed the clinical and biological characteristics of the above cited individuals and correlated them with the deletions identified using MLPA P064 kit. Deletion size was further characterized using MLPA follow up kit P 029 A1.Results: The data show that 21 of the patients had a hemizygous deletion of ELN, STX1A, FZD9, CYLN2, and LIMK1 genes, whereas three individuals had an atypical deletion (a smaller one that does not extend telometically futher than LIMK1 gene) with an incomplete phenotype (mild dysmorphic face, su pravalvular aortic stenosis and learning difficulties). The dysmorphic face was present in all individuals, but the frequency of different features varied. 71% of subjects associated congenital heart defects, whereas hypercalcemia was found only in 19% of the patients with WBS. All subjects had mild to moderate intellectual disability. Conclusions: For countries with limited financial resources, the use of a combination of MLPA kits allows both confirmation and estimation of the deletion size in WBS patients. A comprehensive phenotype genotype corre lation is provided, with detailed illustration of particular cases.",2015

On examination she was noted to have facial features typical of Williams Beuren syndrome (WBS) and a systolic murmur. Cardiac investigations identified mild left ventricular hy pertrophy, mild mitral valve prolapse with regurgitation, and hypertension requiring treatment with amlodipine. Microarray analysis detected an aty pical deletion of 1.6Mb at 7q11.23 partially overlapping the WBS region. Im balance of this region has not previously been reported in the literature. WBS is a microdeletion syndrome caused by a recurrent deletion of 1.5 1.8 Mb at 7q11.23. The syndrome is characterised by a specific phenotype that includes cardiac, facial, cognitive, endocrine, growth, and connective tissue features. The microdeletion typically encompasses 26 to 28 genes. While de letion of ELN is established as responsible for the cardiovascular phenotype, the exact phenotypic impact of the other genes in the region is not yet clear. Overlapping deletions provide an important insight into genotype pheno type correlations. It has been suggested that BAZ1B is a candidate for cra niofacial development and thus the facial features of WBS. However, our patient has typical facial features and preservation of BAZ1B.

We report that heterozygous missense mutations in KCNH1 account for a significant proportion of ZLS. KCNH1 encodes Eag1/Kv10.1, a member of the ether ÃÂ go go family of voltage gated K+ chan nels. Patch clamp recordings in cells expressing homomeric KCNH1 mutant channels revealed a shift in the threshold for K+ current activation to more negative potentials for all but one mutant. For the latter, co expression expe riments demonstrated a dominant action over the wild type channel, with reduced K+ conductance of the heterotetrameric channels at depolarizing potentials but a pronounced conductance at negative potentials. These data support a gain of function effect of all KCNH1 mutants. We also report that a single missense change in ATP6V1B2 underlie a small fraction of ZLS. AT P6V1B2 encodes the B2 subunit of the vacuolar H+ ATPase, a multimeric en zyme that mediates acidification in organelles by pumping protons against an electrochemical gradient.

The genetic mechanisms underlying the onset and progression of this type of cancer are still not clear. The aim of this study was to gain an insight into the mutational profile of tumour tissue from 5 Bulgarian patients with adenosquamous carcinoma of the lung. Materials and Methods: DNA was extracted from formalin fixed, paraffin embedded tumour tissue. Libraries were prepared for sequencing using a TruSight Cancer Panel and included the exons of 94 cancer genes and 284 SNPs associated with cancer. Sequencing was performed on an Illumina Mi Seq platform. The BWA pipeline was used for alignment and variant calling. Results: In each of the patients we identified at least one clear cut driver mutation leading to a loss of function of a haploinsufficient gene. The ge nes affected were APC (p. Ser2497Ter; p. Gly857Ter; c.730 1G>T), TP53 (p. Arg196Ter; p. Val197Met), BRCA2 (c.9089_9090insA), ATM (p. Tyr313Ter) and NF1 (p. Arg304Ter). Each patient also carried other somatic and germli ne potential driver mutations such as heterozygous nonsense mutations in the haplosufficient FANC family genes (FANCA, FANCC, FANCG, FANCI, FAN CM), as well as many novel missense mutations in other genes predicted as pathogenic by the RadialSVM algorithm. Conclusion: We observed great heterogeneity in all patients, which high lights the need for a personalised approach in designing a therapeutic stra tegy for lung cancer patients in order to maximise their chances for suc cessful treatment.",2015

Introduction: Mutations in the CCAAT/enhancer binding protein alpha (CEBPA) gene occur approximately in 5 Ã¢ÂÂ 10 % of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients and can be used as molecular markers for monitoring of minimal residual disease (MRD). However, detection of MRD using quan titative real time PCR (RT qPCR) is complicated due to GC rich regions and thus validation of leukemia specific and sensitive MRD assay can be techni cally difficult. The goal of our work was the application of next generation amplicon based deep sequencing (NGS) as a quantitative detection method for MRD monitoring. Materials and methods: Since 2010, we have performed mutational analysis of the CEBPA gene coding region in 411 AML patients at initial diagnosis using Sanger sequencing. In patients with the CEBPA mutation as the only detected mutation, we designed leukemia specific assay using RT qPCR. Ho wever, in 5 patients the assay did not provide sufficient sensitive and speci fic detection of residual leukemic cells. In these cases MRD was monitored by NGS technology. Results: From January 2013 we examined 38 samples from 5 AML patients. The assay detection sensitivity achieved the threshold of 10 4 to 10 5 (1 leu kemic cell in 10 000 to 1 leukemic cell in 100 000 cells). Dynamics of residu al leukemic cells correlated with clinical outcome of the patients. In patients with relapse, the occurrence of the CEBPA mutation was also confirmed by conventional Sanger sequencing. Conclusion: Quantitative assessment of CEBPA mutations using NGS offers a promising way for the detection of MRD level necessary for individualized monitoring of disease status and treatment efficacy.",2015
23895,"Alterations in the polymorphisms of DNA repair genes have been associated with the pathogenesis of leukemia. DNA double strand break repair pa thway represents the main pathway in maintaining genome stability which is distinguished into two pathways: homologous recombination (HR) and non homologous end joining (NHEJ). The Rad51 proteins are essential com ponents of the HR, whereas Lig4 proteins represent central components of the NHEJ. In this study, we investigated possible implications of the G135C and C26T germline polymorphisms of RAD51 and LIG4 genes, respectively, in AML development and its specific chromosomal abnormalities. Geno typing was performed in 83 patients and 91 controls by PCR RFLPs. The polymorphic site G135C of RAD51 gene showed the same allelic and genoty pic frequency between patients and controls.

23896,"Petersburg, Russian Federation. The aim of the research was to analyse frequency of DNMT3A mutations in AML patients, their association with clinico hematologic parameters and prognostic significance. The investigation group included 143 AML patients. Mutations DNMT3A R882 were identified in 23 (16,1%) patients: R882H 16, R882ÃÂ¡ 6, R882S 1. Patients with DNMT3A R882 had higher WBC (p,0,001) and platelets (p,0,020) count at diagnosis and more frequently belonged to FAB groups M5 (p,0,003) and M4 (p,0,012), as compared with DNMT3Awt. Of 23 pa tients who had AML with DNMT3A mutations, 17 (24,3%) had tumors with normal cytogenetic profiles (of a total of 70 cytogenetically normal samples) (p,0,009). Patients with isolated DNMT3A mutations were seen in 4 cases, whereas in the rest of patients they were detected simultaneously with mu tations in genes FLT3, NPM1, NRAS and CKIT . DNTM3A mutations were si gnificantly more prevalent in NPM1mut (p,0,005) and FLT3 ITD (p,0,005) positive cases than wild type. DNMT3A mutations associated with negative influence on patients overall survival (OS) and risk of relapse, compared with DNMT3Awt (Me of OS and RFS: 5,2 and 13,0; 4,8 and 10,0 months; ÃÂ , 0,031 and ÃÂ , 0,045, respectively).Summary. AML with DNMT3A mutations represent the group, homogeneous on a number of clinical and laboratory parameters. DNMT3A mutations are highly recurrent in patients with de novo AML with an intermediate risk cytogenetic profile. The presence of DNMT3A mutations can be considered as an independent adverse prognostic factor for survival, suggesting that testing of DNMT3A mutations can help further improve risk stratification in AML patients.",2015
23897,"Every human tumor type has its own unique mi RNA expression profile. Mi RNA can be located in intergenic spaces, in antisense strain, in introns and exons. Such genome organization can determine the mechanism of coordi nation between RNA and protein expression, but also represents the value of mi RNA motifs in human evolution. Based on the findings that genome functioning is connected with its structure we have conducted the bioinfor matics analysis of mature mi RNA motifs distribution in tumor suppressor genes surroundings. We analyzed the intergene spaces located in surroundings of the tumor sup pressor genes (APC; BRCA1; BRCA2; CDKN2A; DCC; MEN1; NF1; NF2; PTEN; RB1; TP53; VHL; WT1). Sequences were obtained from NCBI data base and miRBase release 21 using E utilities API. Motif search was carried out with MEME Suite program package. The results were filtered to yield only those matches with 85% identical nucleotides. The entire set of non coding DNA sequences contained 755 motifs of 19 23 nucleotides, homologous to 261 mature mi RNA sequences. About 60% of all motifs were homologous to miR 5585, miR 1273g, miR 619, miR 5196, miR 5095, miR 709 and miR 1285. These motifs can be considered as non specific and widely spread in human genome. We have found that tumor suppressor genes have specific patterns of mi RNA homologous motifs dis tribution. Prevalent motif type and the density of motif distribution varied from gene to gene.

23898,"PURPOSE: To present a patient with familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) caused by adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) somatic mosaicism; Descrip tion: we report of a twenty one year old female presented with rectal blee ding and abdominal pain. Colonoscopy and esophagogastroduodenoscopy revealed extensive polyposis of the recto sigmoid junction, distal sigmoid, proximal right colon and cecum. The rectum was essentially spared aside from two small pedunculated polyps. The stomach and duodenum, inclu ding the papilla, were normal. In preparation for recto sigmoid sparing surgery, more than sixty polyps were removed. The patient had no extra colonic signs of FAP . Her maternal grandmother was diagnosed with colon cancer at age seventy six, but there was no other family history of polyps or colon cancer. Methodology: Next generation sequencing (NGS) analysis was performed using the ColoSeq TM panel* on DNA extracted from both periphe ral blood lymphocytes and colonic polyps. RESULTS: Molecular analysis de tected the p. E1408X deleterious mutation in the APC gene in 12 of 276 (4%) reads of the DNA in the peripheral blood and in 30% of the DNA from colonic polyps. CONCLUSIONS: In this patient, 4% APC mosaicism of the peripheral blood lead to florid polyposis. Somatic mosaicism has been reported to cau se cancer syndromes in a few cases, but has been underestimated. This case should reinforce the need for NGS analysis in all patients with a personal history of polyposis, no family history of colon polyps/cancer, and no identi fied germline mutation by traditional less sensitive approaches.",2015
23899,"Mutations in the BCR ABL tirozin kinase (TK) domain represent the most common mechanism of resistance to personalized therapy with TK inhibi tors (TKI) in patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML).Mutational status of the BCR ABL gene corresponding to the TK domain was analyzed by capillary sequencing in 45 CML patients with suboptimal re sponse/failure to TKI, in order to tailor their therapy. The response of the patients to TKI therapy was monitored at molecular and cytogenetic level. Mutations in the BCR ABL gene were identified in 18 (40%) patients: a sin gle mutation in 15 patients and 2 mutations in 3 patients. Mutations identi fied corresponded to several regions of the BCR ABL oncoprotein, such as: the P loop (M244V, G250E, Q252H), the ATP binding region (L298V, V299L, T315I, F317L), the SH2 contact region (M351T) and the substrate binding region (F359V). The T315I mutation, conferring resistance to almost all known TKI, was detected both as single mutation (in 7 patients) and in com bination with M351T (1 patient).The 2 mutations detected in the BCR ABL TK domain in case of 2 patients represented different clones; during dasatinib therapy, the resistant clones were selected (M351T and T315 respective), while the clones sensitive to this drug have disappeared. Different chromosomal abnormalities associated with clonal evolution were identified in 3 patients, which may be the major cause of secondary resi stance to TKI. Conclusions: Mutational status of the BCR ABL TK domain is valuable information for the best therapeutic decision and management of patients with CML; Additional TKI resistance mechanisms can be detected by a combined molecular and cytogenetic monitoring of the CML patients.",2015

A gene expression analysis of the 84 genes from Cancer drug resistance and metabolism panel (Qiagene) of 30 tumours and CytoChip Oligo aCGH, 44K format (Bluegnome) of 12 tumours were performed. Results:The DNA copy number data shows gains, amplifications and loses in the bladder cancer genome, compared to the control. Tumours from pT2, pT2a and pT2b stages have higher numbers of chromosomal imbalances then non invasive tumours.

23901,"Treatment of bladder superficial tumours is dependent on the risk of re currence and it is therefore clinically important to identify bladder cancers with a high risk of intravesical recurrence after transurethral bladder tu mour resection. For the improvement of recurrence prognosis we applied gene expression microarray analysis to two groups of bladder tumours (su perficial bladder tumours with no or late recurrence during the period of two years versus early recurrence ones). Data from microarrays containing 29,019 targets (Applied Biosystems) were subjected to a panel of statistical analyses to identify bladder cancer recurrence associated gene expression changes. After validation 33 genes manifested significant differences bet ween both groups. The significant expression was observed in the group of patients without recurrence by 30 genes of which the highest differences were detected by NINJ1, GNE, ANXA1, TNFSF15, WDR34, ARHGEF4, PRICK LE1, PSAT1, RNASE1, TM4SF1, TSPAN1, PLOD2 and WDR72. These genes code for signal transduction, vascular remodeling and vascular endotheli al growth inhibition mainly.

All cases with available germline DNA (n,297) were screened for BRCA1 and BRCA2 gene mutations using combination of methods (HRM, Sanger/Next Generation Sequencing, MLPA). Progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) was assessed between BRCA1/2 mutation carriers and BRCA1/2 wild type patients. To eliminate survivorship bias, analysis was limited for cases with BRCA testing performed <36 month from the diagnosis. Various clinical risk factors for PFS and OS were assessed by univariate and multivariate Cox regression analysis with stepwise model selection process. Results: Older age (hazard ratio [HR], 1.032; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.010 1.055; P,0.0047), nonoptimal cytoreduction (HR, 3.170; 95% CI, 1.986 5.060; P,0.0001), and BRCA1/2 wild type (HR, 1.625 [1.003 2.632]; P,0.0486) were significantly associated with shorter PFS in multivariate Cox regression analysis.

23903,"Most people at risk of hereditary cancer remain unrecognized. Cost and complexity of interpreting sequenced data are significant barriers. As tech nical advances reduce the cost of sequencing, and new interventions offer real hope of cancer cure and prevention, the problem of variant interpreta tion has become more visible. The BRCA Challenge calls on clinicians, clinical laboratories and researchers across the world to share their knowledge of variation in the BRCA 1 and 2 sequences. Existing databases; BIC, UMD, LOVD, ClinVar, HGMD are being linked to ensure a single point of access. The goal is to provide the com munity with a reliable record of those variants that can be interpreted as pathogenic for a high penetrance phenotype versus benign. An international interpretation community will include the existing ENIGMA project, which establishes clinical significance of variants in these genes. Meanwhile, an API suitable for the extraction of all relevant sequence variation is being developed, including co occurrence data, from genomic datasets to better define non pathogenic variants across population diversity. Ultimately the database will facilitate exploration of the clinical significance of variants across pathogenicity, building on and contributing to the work of CIMBA (the Consortium of Investigators of Modifiers of BRCA1/2), fo cused on refining the estimates for penetrance of a subset of variants, as well as ClinGen (Clinical Genome Resource) which provides curated geno mic knowledge to improve clinical care.

23904,"Introduction: BRCA1 and BRCA2 are the two major genes associated with inherited breast and ovarian cancer. Double heterozygosity (DH) is an ex tremely rare event in which both BRCA1 and BRCA2 are mutated simulta neously in a patient. To date, most cases of DH reported are in Ashkenazi populations, but only a few cases have been reported to have more than one non Ashkenazi BRCA mutation. Here, we have described two families with two different mutations, one in BRCA1 and another in BRCA2. One case includes an Ashkenazi mutation and a non Ashkenazi mutation while the other case includes two non Ashkenazi mutations. Method: MLPA and bidirectional Sanger sequencing analysis of the entire coding region of BRCA1 and BRCA2 were carried out. Result: Family 1. Family with early onset of breast cancer, our patient was dia gnosed at the age of 33 and her mother at the age of 36. In the index case, the c.5266dupC frameshift mutation in BRCA1 (common Ashkenazi mutation) and the c.9097_9098insT frameshift mutation in BRCA2 were detected. Family 2. The proband was diagnosed with breast cancer at the age of 36 and has a family history of breast cancer from the maternal side. Sequen cing analysis showed that the patient was heterozygous for the c.3750delG frameshift mutation in BRCA1 and the c.4447delA frameshift mutation in BRCA2.

23905,"Background: BRCA1/2 carriers have a lifetime risk of ovarian cancer of up to 30 50% and no evidence based ovarian cancer screening is available. Therefore, most women opt for a risk reducing bilateral salpingo oophorec tomy (RRBSO). Since 2007 the BRCA family service at GuyÃ¢ÂÂs Hospital has advised gynaecological surgeons to follow a protocol for RRBSO in BRCA1/2 carriers as standard practice. This evidence based protocol, implemented after an audit in 2006, includes removal of fallopian tubes, serial sectioning, peritoneal washings, and HRT recommendations. Methods: An audit of women who had RRBSO between February 2013 to May 2014 (37 women) was undertaken to measure compliance with this protocol and review the evidence for the protocol. Data was collected from the BRCA family service database and clinical notes were reviewed. Infor mation about post surgical use of HRT was collected from the patient. Results: 84% (31 women) were between 40 and 59 years at the time of sur gery. Removal of fallopian tubes was evident in 97% (36 women), sectioning was undertaken in 76% (28 women) and peritoneal washings was docu mented in 51% (19 women). This showed an improvement in compliance with the protocol compared to the 2006 audit (36%, 16% and 8% respec tively). No pattern was identified between compliance and hospital where surgery was performed. Conclusion: Compliance with recommendations has vastly improved since the implementation of the RRBSO protocol. Inconsistencies between and within hospitals highlights the need for further discussion with surgeons in our catchment area. Before disseminating the results widely, literature review and revision of protocol is planned.",2015

Conclusions We concluded that there was a 6.9% pick up rate for mutations which is lower than the 10% threshold. However, the small sample size may have contributed to this. The individuals in whom mutations were identified had a very high Manchester score (29 and 37 respectively). Interestingly, a very high number (24.2%) of VUSs were also identified.

Background: Somatic and germline mutations in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 ge nes may predict outcomes to ovarian cancer therapies such as platinum and PARP inhibitors. To identify patients that may benefit from these therapies, a companion diagnostic test has been developed to analyze tumor speci mens for BRCA1/2 mutations. The aim of this study is to validate the testÃ¢ÂÂs analytical performance. Methods: Genomic DNA isolated from 42 anonymized ovarian tumor samp les underwent full sequence and large rearrangement analysis using next generation sequencing (NGS). The criteria for calls required 99% of bases to have Ã¢ÂÂ¥ 100 reads. The reproducibility of this test was evaluated by se quencing 10 samples in triplicate across 6 batches. All samples underwent analysis by an independent laboratory to verify results. Results: The analytical sensitivity was estimated to be >99.07% (lower bound of 0.95 C. I.), with an analytical specificity >99%. The average read depth was approximately 425X per base, with a minimum inclusion cri terion of 50X per base. All samples that were previously identified by alter native methods as positive for deletions/duplications were correctly identi fied using NGS dosage analysis. This study also showed that the results were 100% concordant with independent laboratory analysis both finding 319 sequence variants and had 100% intra and inter run reproducibility.

23908,"TripleÃ¢ÂÂnegative breast cancer (TNBC) is an aggressive breast cancer subtype which is generally characterized by poor overall survival, mainly attributed to inadequate therapeutic targets. Germline BRCA1 mutations have been strongly associated with TNBC, the prevalence of which can be as high as 29% in populations with strong founder effect. Mutations in other breast cancer predisposing genes can be associated with TNBC, but the contributi on of these genes is still unclear. TNBC patients (n,733; mean age 45.19 years) were recruited solely on their TNBC status, between years 1999 2014. Initially, the Greek founder BRCA1 mutations were tested; individuals who were wild type at these loci were then tested by next generation sequencing using a 27 breast cancer gene panel. Loss of function mutations were identified in 25.3% (186/733) of the indi viduals tested. BRCA1 mutations were observed in 20.2% (148/733). The mean age of breast cancer diagnosis was 39.6 years. Another 38 deleterious mutations were detected in 14 additional genes. Interestingly, 3.1% of the se mutations cluster in only three genes, namely BRCA2 (1.9%), RAD51C (0.68%) and BARD1 (0.54%).TNBC status alone can be a significant predictive factor for germline mutati ons in predisposition genes, irrespective of family history and early onset of disease. Even with the application of improved DNA sequencing techniques, BRCA1 loss of function mutations are still the major players in TNBC. Mu tations in additional genes, which are BRCA1 partners in the homologous recombination pathway, also seem to be overrepresented in TNBC patients. These observations might be beneficial in terms of developing targeted the rapeutics, such as poly ADP ribose polymerase inhibitors.",2015
23909,"Introduction: Germline pathogenic variants in BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes are associated with inherited high risk of breast (BC) and ovarian cancer (OC). The whole coding sequence and the flanking exon intron junctions are rou tinely screened in genomic DNA. However, in only about 25% of the cases a clear deleterious variant is identified. The disease susceptibility may also be associated with alterations in gene expression due to variants located in splicing and/or transcription regulatory non coding regions, not included in the conventional analysis. To test this hypothesis, we analyze the whole BRCA1/2 cDNA in high risk Spanish families testing negative for BRCA1/2.Materials and Methods: Total RNA of 200 probands and 10 control indivi duals was isolated from peripheral blood leukocytes. PCR overlapping am plicons including the entire cDNA of both genes were generated. Full length transcripts were qualitatively assessed by QIAXCEL and bidirectional Sanger sequencing, allowing the detection of aberrant transcripts and alterations in natural occurring isoforms. Single polymorphisms in coding regions were also identified to confirm biallelic expression. Results: To date, one out of 60 patients analyzed presents an aberrant tran script consisting in a partial inclusion of intron 21 in BRCA1. This splicing alteration is yet to be confirmed by capillary electrophoresis of fluorescent amplicons. A potential allelic imbalance of BRCA1 expression has been also detected in another individual. Conclusions: Although the frequency of splicing and expression alterations in high risk families appears to be low, the analysis of RNA can provide a more comprehensive BRCA1/2 diagnostic.(Financial support: AECC grant, FIS PI12/02585; FIS PI13/01711).",2015
23910,"Objectives: BRCA2 mutation carriers are more likely to develop prostate cancer (PrCa) and aggressive disease. We assessed whether men in the IM PACT study (Identification of Men with a genetic predisposition to ProstAte Cancer: Targeted screening in men at higher genetic risk and controls) exhi bit altered PSA kinetics prior to diagnosis. Methods: We calculated PSA Velocity (PSAV) using validated methods: arithmetic mean(a), linear regression(b) and first and last readings(c) equa tions. Pearson chi square test was used to compare PSAV between BRCA1/2 carriers versus negative controls in those that underwent prostate biopsy (PB). Binary Logistic Regression was used to compare PSAV between carri ers who were and were not diagnosed with cancer. Results: PSAV was available for 191 men who underwent a PB; 57 PrCas were diagnosed. There was no difference in the median PSAV between BR CA1 carriers and non carriers who were diagnosed with cancer (0.24 vs. 0.37 ng/ml/yr, respectively). In comparison, BRCA2 carriers with cancer showed a significantly higher PSAV when compared to non carriers (1.36 vs. 0.50 ng/ml/yr, respectively, p,<0.05). BRCA2 carriers with a PSAV over 0.75ng/ml/yr were 5 times more likely to be diagnosed with PrCa compared to non carriers [95%CI,1.5 14; P value,0.003]. In addition, BRCA2 carriers with cancer were 12 times more likely to have high grade disease (Gleason score Ã¢ÂÂ¥7) phenotype compared to non carriers with cancer [95%CI: 1.1 98; p,0.039].Conclusions: This is the first study to document that BRCA2 carriers have different PSA kinetics compared to non carriers. This increased PSAV most likely reflects prior associations with disease susceptibility, aggressive di sease and PrCa specific mortality.",2015

Of the 400 BRCA2 carriers, 90 had therapeutic mastecto my for BC (25 unilateral, 21 bilateral, 44 unilateral with contralateral RRM). Of the remainder 76(25%) chose bilateral RRM and 234(75%) had no bre ast surgery. Conclusions: Uptake of bilateral RRM in BRCA carriers was slightly higher for BRCA1 vs BRCA2 mutation carriers (33% vs 25%), but this was not sta tistically significantly different. Rates of contralateral RRM with therapeutic mastectomy for BRCA mutation carriers with unilateral BC were similar for both genes (~50%). Further work is underway to investigate if RRM uptake has been constant or is increasing. This work was funded by the RM/ICR NIHR BRC.",2015
23912,"Genetic heterogeneity of breast cancer represents a significant challenge with respect to disease course and patient clinical management. Understan ding molecular evolution of tumours both temporally and spatially would contribute further insight into molecular derangements driving disease pro gression. Exploratory analyses have been conducted on exome sequencing data of genomic DNA extracts from six invasive breast carcinoma samples re presenting matched primary tumour and the corresponding axillary lymph node metastases. Data was mined regarding concordance and discordance between primary tumour samples and their respective metastatic variants. Initial findings suggest that 37 candidate indels are common to all three axillary lymph node samplings and yet absent from the three samplings of the primary tumour. Several genes have been identified as having frameshift mutations caused by indels that may lead to potential abrogation of protein function. Of the genes with indel mutations in their coding sequences inclu de molecular players that have been previously linked to anti angiogenesis. These initial findings provide the framework for detailed molecular analy ses of the molecular evolution of primary breast cancer and their associated metastases.

However, the mutation frequencies of non BRCA1/2 ge nes associated with familial BC and/or BC/OC are largely unknown. Here, we present the NGS analysis (TruRiskÃ¢ÂÂ¢ gene panel) of a cohort of 574 BRCA1/2 negative index cases which comprises 256 unselected patients with triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) and 318 cases from high risk BC and BC/OC families. By focusing on 21 BC/OC associated genes (ATM, BARD1, BRIP1, CDH1, CHEK2, FANCM, MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, MRE11A, NBN, PALB2, PMS2, PTEN, RAD50, RAD51C, RAD51D, SMARCA4, STK11, TP53, XRCC2), we identi fied 40 different pathogenic variants in 38 unrelated mutation carriers deri ved from 318 high risk BC and BC/OC families (12%). In contrast, only 9 mu tation carriers (3.5%) were discovered among the unselected TNBC cases. Interestingly, we identified a high frequency of pathogenic ATM mutations (n,10, 3.1%) in the familial cases whereas no ATM mutations were found in the TNBC cohort. Additionally, we found a high frequency of mutations in CHEK2, PALB2 , RAD50 and confirm FANCM and SMARCA4 as novel BC/ OC predisposing genes. Due to the unexpectedly high mutation frequencies in familial cases, our study highlights the importance of these genes to be included in BC/OC routine diagnostics.",2015
23914,"Iranian breast cancer patients are relatively younger than their Western counterparts. Evidence suggests that alterations in estrogen signaling pa thways, including ESR1( estrogen receptor ÃÂ± ), occur during breast cancer development in Caucasians. Epidemiologic studies have revealed that age incidence patterns of breast cancer in Asians differ from those in Caucasi ans. Genomic data for ESR1in either population is therefore of value in the clinical setting for Iranian breast cancer. A case control study was conducted to establish a database of ESR1poly morphisms in Iranian women population in order to compare Western and Asian with Iranian (Asian Caucasians) distributions and to evaluate ESR1 polymorphism as an indicator of clinical outcome. DNA was extracted from Iranian women with breast cancer referred to Imam Khomeini Hospital Complex clinical breast cancer group (150 patients) and in healthy indivi duals (147 healthy control individuals). PCR single strand conformation polymorphism technology was performed. A site of silent single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs1801132 was found, The frequency of allele 1 in codon 325 (CCCÃ¢ÂÂCCG) was significantly higher in breast cancer patients (39.6%) than in control individuals (28.9%; P , 0.007). The allele CCG had also significant association with the occurrence of lymph node metastasis. Data suggest that ESR1polymorphisms in exon 4 codon 325 is correlated with various aspects of breast cancer in Iran.

However, most families severely affected by breast cancer do not harbor mutations in any of these genes. In Finland, founder mutations have been observed in each of these genes, suggesting that the Finnish population may provide a unique resource for identification of additional breast/ovarian cancer alleles. We studied 24 breast cancer patients from 11 Finnish breast cancer families with exome sequencing and further genotyped selected DNA repair variants in 3166 familial and/or unselected breast cancer patients as well as 569 ovarian cancer patients and 2090 population controls. Of all genotyped variants, a nonsense mutation (c.5101C>T , rs147021911, p.

23916,"Introduction: Breast cancer is an important public health problem world wide. The HER2 /neu protooncogene is amplified and overexpressed in approximately 25 30% of invasive breast carcinomas. DNA topoisomera se 2 alpha enzyme controls and alters the topologic states of DNA during transcription. TWIST expression in breast tumors correlate with increased disease recurrence and poor disease free survival. Steroid receptor genes family members such as the RARÃÂ²2 and ESR1 genes are methylated and si lenced in a fraction of breast cancer. Method: In this study we analysed retrospective HER2/neu, TOP2A gene and Chromosome17 copy number alterations by fluorescence in situ hybri dization (FISH) in primary tumor core biopsies from 100 high risk prima ry breast cancer patients (tumors Ã¢ÂÂ¥2 cm and/or lenfatic metastase and/or distant metastases and/or under 40 years) . The methylation levels of the TWIST , RARÃÂ²2 and ESR1 gene promoters were assessed Methylation Sensi tive High Resolution Melting Analysis (MS HRM).Results: In our study, HER2/neu amplifications were identified in 25% and TOP2A amplifications in 24% and deletions in 6% of patients. HER2/neu and TOP2A amplifications are found to be associated with IDC tumor type and high grade also HER2/neu amplifications is associated with PR( ), TO P2A amplifications is associated with ER(+). TOP2A deletions is associated with ER( ) and PR( ). Polysomy17 was present in 23% and monosomy 12% of patients. TWIST , RARÃÂ²2 and ESR1 methylation frequencies were 24%, 90% and 69% respectively.

Hereditary Breast and Ovarian Cancer (HBOC) accounts for ~10% of BC cases, a fraction which stems from the genetic effects of rare alleles. At least 20 genes have been linked to BC susceptibility and a high fraction of genetic effects remains to be explained. The aim of this project is to identify genetic variants linked to HBOC through exome sequencing in Greek patients that were found to be negative for mutations in known can didate genes. Materials and Methods: Exome sequencing was performed on a total of 50 HBOC patients and informative relatives. Exome capture was through the Ion TargetSeq Exome Capture kit and sequencing was performed on the Ion Proton platform. An analytical pipeline was compiled adapting the GATK software package to IP data. Results: We detected an average ~55,000 variants per exome. We filtered our data using criteria based on relatedness of individuals sequenced, BC segregation in families, minor allele frequency of variants and in silico functional evaluation. This resulted into collection of shortlisted variants amounting to ~100 per family. Conclusion: Preliminary results have highlighted candidate variants in PRDM2, EME1, XRRC1 and GAB4. Genetic variants have been validated through Sanger sequencing. Further functional validation is necessary to confirm the pathogenicity of the candidate variants.

23918,"Background:The polymorphism rs61764370 is a functional variant in the let7a binding site of KRAS that is associated with increased cancer risk, particularly breast and ovarian. This risk may be modified by menopausal status and HRT use. Aim:To evaluate the effect of estrogen exposure and withdrawal on development of breast cancer in patients with the KRAS variant (vKRAS).Methods:Isogenic mammary (MCF10A) cell lines with and without vKRAS were cultured and observed for oncogenic transformation in charcoal stripped media following oestrogen withdrawal and restoration. Cells with and wi thout vKRAS were examined for epithelial mesenchymal transition(EMT) by western blot, immunoflourescence, and relative quantification of EMT associated miRNAs. The effect of the vKRAS on disease phenotype was in vestigated in a cohort of patients with breast cancer, comparing variant and wild type genotype carriers. A case control analysis was also performed using a control group of unaffected vKRAS carriers. Data was collected with respect to pathological characteristics, reproductive risk factors and anthro pomorphic measurements. Results:Isogenic cell lines with vKRAS showed evidence of EMT , with relative over expression of vimentin and fibronectin. Acute estrogen withdrawal by addi tion of tamoxifen to charcoal stripped media led to 7.9 fold increase in on cogenic transformation, with reduction in colony formation after restitution of oestrogen. Affected vKRAS carriers were significantly more likely to have oophorectomy pre diagnosis than wild type patients(p,0.033). Affected vKRAS carriers with breast cancer had lower BMI(p<0.01) than vKRAS un affected controls. HRT discontinuation in vKRAS carriers was significantly associated with post menopausal triple negative breast cancer. Conclusions: Estrogen withdrawal and a low estrogen state appear to in crease breast cancer and predict aggressive tumor biology in women with variant KRAS.",2015

Evolution of the breast cancer genome from pre invasive stages to asyn chronous metastasis is complex and mostly unexplored, but highly deman ded as it may provide novel markers for and mechanistic insights in cancer progression. The increasing use of personalized therapy of breast cancer necessitates knowledge of the degree of genomic concordance between dif ferent steps of malignant progression as primary tumors often are used as surrogates of systemic disease. Based on exome sequencing we performed copy number profiling and point mutation detection on successive steps of breast cancer progression from one breast cancer patient, including two dif ferent regions of Ductal Carcinoma In Situ (DCIS), primary tumor and an asynchronous metastasis. We identify a remarkable landscape of somatic mutations, retained throughout breast cancer progression and with new mutational events emerging at each step. Our data, contrary to the proposed model of early dissemination of metastatic cells and parallel progression of primary tumors and metastases, provide evidence of linear progression of breast cancer with relatively late dissemination from the primary tumor. The genomic discordance between the different stages of tumor evolution in this patient emphasizes the importance of molecular profiling of metastatic tissue directing molecularly targeted therapy at recurrence.",2015
23920,"Several risk alleles have been identified for breast and ovarian cancer pre disposition and most of them encode proteins that function in DNA repair. In the Finnish population, recurrent founder mutations have been observed in most of the susceptibility genes whereas in out bred populations each gene may harbor rare unique mutations. A prospective candidate for breast and ovarian cancer susceptibility is the HELQ helicase that has a role in the reso lution of DNA interstrand cross links. HELQ interacts with the RAD51 para log complex BCDX2. Two components of the complex, RAD51C and RAD51D, increase the risk of ovarian cancer, while the other two, RAD51B and XRCC2 have been associated with breast cancer risk. To investigate the role of HELQ in cancer predisposition and to identify putative recurrent founder mutati ons, we screened the HELQ gene for germline variation in 182 Finnish fami lial breast or ovarian cancer patients. To study the role of common variation in the gene, we performed haplotype analyses for 1517 breast and 308 ova rian cancer cases and 1234 population controls. No deleterious mutations were identified among the patients and the haplotype distribution did not differ between breast or ovarian cancer cases and population controls. Our results indicate that HELQ is not a major breast and ovarian cancer suscep tibility gene in the Finnish population. However, we cannot rule out rare risk variants in the Finnish or other populations.

23923,"Germline mutations in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 breast cancer susceptibility genes account for up to 20% of inherited breast cancer cases. This leaves a sizable fraction of familial cases where the heritability link remains uni dentified meaning affected families may not receive appropriate clinical management including predictive testing for at risk family members. In re cent years a number of other breast cancer susceptibility genes have been identified. Although they may be individually less prevalent, together they promise to account for a significant proportion of familial cases. An exten ded breast cancer gene next generation sequencing strategy has therefore been developed to determine the role these genes play within the clinical diagnostic setting. A large cohort of families previously found not to have a pathogenic BRCA1/2 gene mutation were screened for mutations in an additional 10 genes (ATM, BRIP1, CDH1, CHEK2, PALB2, PTEN, RAD51C, RAD51C, STK11, and TP53) enriched using the Illumina TruSight Cancer Pa nel. Sequencing data was processed using an in house bioinformatics pipe line optimised for sensitive indel detection. To date this new strategy has been used to screen 121 patients. Twelve patients (10%) were identified as having a class 4/5 pathogenic mutation in ATM, CHEK2, PALB2, RAD51D and TP53 according to criteria recommended by the ACGS Evaluation of Pa thogenicity Best Practice Guidelines, including confirmation by RNA analy sis.

23924,"Background: The identification of novel biomarkers for early detection of breast cancer would be a great advance. Due to their role in tumorigenesis and stability in body fluids, microRNAs (miRNAs) are emerging as a promi sing diagnostic tool. The aim of this study was to identify miRNAs deregu lated in breast tumors and evaluate the potential of circulating miRNAs in breast cancer detection. Methods: MiRNA expression profiling of 1919 human miRNAs was conduc ted in paraffined tissue from 122 breast tumors and 11 normal breast tis sues. Differential expression analysis was performed generating a microar ray classifier. The most relevant miRNAs were analyzed in plasma from 26 healthy individuals and 83 breast cancer patients (36 pretreated and 47 postreated), and validated in 116 healthy individuals and 114 pretreated patients. Results: We identified a large number of miRNAs deregulated in breast can cer and generated a 25 miRNA microarray classifier that discriminates bre ast tumors with high sensitivity and specificity. Ten miRNAs were selected for further investigation in plasma and 4 of them (miR 505 5p, miR 125b 5p, miR 21 5p and miR 96 5p) were found to be significantly overexpressed in pretreated breast cancer patients when compared with healthy individu als in two different series of plasma. MiR 505 5p and miR 96 5p were the most valuable biomarkers (AUC,0.72). Moreover, the levels of miR 3656, miR 505 5p and miR 21 5p decreased in a group of treated patients.

23925,"HOXB13 plays an important role in breast tumorigenesis as high expression of HOXB13 predicts poor outcome and adverse response to endocrine thera py. At the genetic level, the HOXB13 p. G84E mutation confers a four to five fold increased prostate cancer risk and thus HOXB13 p. G84E might also be associated with increased breast cancer risk. Previous studies investigating this association, however, reported conflicting results. Therefore, we now have comprehensively interrogated the entire HOXB13 coding sequence for mutations in 1250 non BRCA1&2 familial breast cancer cases and 800 con trols. In total, seven missense mutations were identified of which five were seen only once. The p. G84E mutation, however, was identified in 4 (0.33%) of 1215 cases and 6 (0.79%) of 759 controls. Another recurrent mutation, p. R217C, was found in 6 (0.50%) of 1206 cases and 1 (0.13%) of 765 con trols. Because both mutations were predicted to be damaging, we further evaluated their association with breast cancer risk by expanding our case control study to include a total of 4520 non BRCA1&2 familial breast cancer cases and 3127 controls. Custom genotyping revealed that p. G84E was pre sent in 22 (0.50%) of 4415 cases and 22 (0.71%) of 3089 controls (OR,0.70, 95% CI,0.39 1.26, P,0.23). The HOXB13 p.

However, the ra rity of pathogenic mutations in small subsets of cells can make identification of such alleles difficult. In this study, we demonstrate a complete workflow that facilitates the identification of rare and novel alleles from FFPE tumor sections. We collected small regions with different cellular morphologies from lung tumor samples using laser capture microdissection, extracted both DNA and RNA from these regions, and characterized mutations pre sent and transcript abundances by using AmpliseqÃ¢ÂÂ¢ targeted sequencing. We show that LCM facilitates the detection of alleles that are not detectab le in macrodissected tissue scrapes.

Finally, we show that RNA expression patterns are also clearly different in the different regions. Interestingly, dissected regions with similar gross tissue morphologies display differences in alleles present and RNA expression patterns.

23928,"Introduction: Genetic lesions in cancer can determine prognosis and have diagnostic value. Next generation sequencing facilitates the detection of a wide array of somatic mutations, copy number alterations (CNAs), and gene fusions in a single assay. With increased sequencing depth, mutations pre sent in only a fraction of the neoplastic tissue can be identified. Detection of these mutations after sequencing DNA and RNA involves a complex set of variant detection algorithms tailored specifically for cancer analysis. Materials and Methods: We designed a cancer panel using an augmented target enrichment strategy optimized for even coverage across the entire span of gene content to detect small variants, CNAs, and gene fusions. The panel includes over 1,500 cancer genes and micro RNAs. Very high depth (>500x) sequencing detects low representation alleles. We tested the panel and pipeline using over 30 different cancer samples including cancer cell lines, engineered cells containing specific cancer mutations, and primary tumors in FFPE. Results: We demonstrate that this cancer gene panel and analysis strategy is able to detect mutations of each major type with high sensitivity and positi ve predictive value. We saw greater than 99% sensitivity for small variants down to 5% allele frequency. We also detected known gene fusion events including EML4 ALK and BCR ABL1 accurately in all 20 cancer samples with known fusions. Moreover, the assay was able to identify CNAs consistent with the known state, including detection of EGFR amplification, EGFRvIII, PTEN loss, and p16 loss in known cases. Conclusions: The high depth, augmented cancer gene panel assay is able to comprehensively identify cancer mutations with high accuracy.",2015

Also there is a ca tegory, with unclear family histories, where the guidelines recommend that patients are not referred directly but discussed with specialists. We have explored the nature of family histories that fall into this category and how to integrate this information into primary care decision support software. The guidelines also recommend genetic testing, hence referral, when probability of BRCA1/BRCA2 is greater than 10%. Materials and Methods: In our exploratory trial all women aged 30 to 60 in four General Practices, in Central England, were invited to complete a family history questionnaire. The family histories were assessed against national guidelines and Manchester Scoring System. Results: Currently, 13.1% (126) of 963 women completing the question naire were recommended by guidelines to discuss with familial cancer spe cialist.

Further, the specialist identified that the guidelineÃ¢ÂÂs referral criteria had not fully taken account of familial risk of related cancers and age of onset in relatives. Conclusion: To operationalise national guidelines and implement decision support software in primary care, uncertain family histories need to be re duced. This could be achieved by combining national guidelines with con sensus opinion of specialists and key attributes of evidence based referral tools, such as Manchester Scoring Systems.

23932,"Clear Cell Renal Cell Carcinoma (ccRCC) is well known for the heterogeneity of its clinical, histologic, and genetic profiles. We optimized the preparation of DNA samples from paraffin material to identify the genetic profile of dif ferent tumour areas of one case of ccRCC. DNA was isolated from paraffin sections of four tumour areas and normal kidney cortex. The morphologi cal variety among different areas of the tumour has been documented. We performed pre analytical RT PCR to measure the quality of amplifiable DNA input. Aliquotes of 100 ng of DNA were subjected to whole exome sequen cing (Agilent SureSelect All exon V2ÃÂ®, Illumina HISEQ 2500ÃÂ®) and targeted exome sequencing (NugenOvationÃÂ® Target Enrichment System) as an alter native approach to obtain reliable sequence data from FFPE material. Based on published data a minimum Quantitative Functional Index (QFI) of 6 7% from RT PCR is needed to achieve 90% confirmed variants on sequencing data. The QFI of our FFPE DNA samples showed values of 8.9 12.6%, indica ting that the quality of our DNA samples was acceptable for further analysis. The quality control report of sequencing data showed a 20x coverage of 68 86%. Preliminary analyses of the sequence data identified 151 somatic mu tations, including 3 indels. In these preliminary data we see a unique genetic profile shared by areas which have similar tumour histological grade. The observed mutational heterogeneity present among different areas of ccRCC may be important in cancer development.",2015
23933,"Detection of somatic mutations is challenging since percent tumor content in clinical samples is variable and is compounded by tumor heterogeneity. Additionally, circulating cfDNA and FFPE samples are limited in quantity, and FFPE samples can be damaged. To address these challenges, we deve loped a single tube, multiplexed amplicon sequencing method that employs hundreds of primer pairs for amplification of target loci, producing ready to run libraries for Illumina sequencing. The two step method multiplexed PCR followed by a 10 minute adapter ligation results in amplicons that are 120 160 bp in length, enabling amplification and variant calling from cfD NA sized DNA fragments or damaged FFPE DNA. An oncology panel was de veloped to target known, clinically relevant mutations in 56 genes. The pa nel design encompasses single exons (e.g. BRAF) and comprehensive coding exon coverage of entire genes (e.g. TP53), depending on the allele distribu tion across each gene. To validate this panel, a cohort of control and clinical samples with pre validated genotypes was tested using 10ng of input DNA. Variant calling was performed using GATK and LoFreq. Robust detection of 5% mutant frequency was observed, and the limit of detection was as low as 1% mutant frequency. The percent on target bases and coverage uniformity were both >95%, where uniformity is defined as the percent bases covered at >20% of the mean coverage. These results indicate that this multiplexed amplicon panel is an excellent tool to assess multiple oncogenes in limiting clinical samples, enabling high throughput, cost effective NGS analysis.",2015

As circulating tumor DNA is often present at low frequencies within circulating cell free DNA, targeted sequencing is an optimal tool for mutation detection. Here, we demonstrate a complete workflow from isolation through validation of circulating tumor DNA. We have optimized an easily automatable protocol using magnetic beads to isolate circulating cell free DNA. It is also scalable for any input volume and can elute in volumes down to 15 ÃÂµL resulting in no loss of low frequency alleles. We demonstrate comparable performance between this bead based isolation and column based isolation. We then completed molecular characterization of the isolated circulating cell free DNA using the multiplexing capabilities of AmpliSeqÃ¢ÂÂ¢ and the Ion TorrentÃ¢ÂÂ¢ platform for targeted sequencing of 50 genes of interest.

23935,"Chondrosarcomas (CHS) are malignant tumours of bone that produce hya line cartilage matrix. Primary CHS is the second most frequently primary malignant tumour of bone after osteosarcoma, and represents about 25% of bone sarcomas. Prognosis is strongly correlated with histological grading. Grade I CHS typically does not metastasize, in contrast with grade II and III CHS. The ten year survival is 83% for patients with grade I, 64% for grade II and 29% for grade III. CHS is highly resistant to both chemotherapy and radiation, making surgical resection the only curative treatment. Due to the limited amount of primary tumour specimens, inclusion of in vi tro models for CHS investigation is of high importance. In addition, as com prehensive genomic analyses of CHS become available, there is a growing need for corresponding cell models to performed functional analysis of new identified variants. To date, commonly used CHS cell lines has been only par tially screened by target genes approaches. Our study is the first which aims to extensively characterize commonly used human CHS cell lines by exome sequencing to identify somatic variants and biological pathways potentially involved in the tumorigenesis. We generate an average of 4.9Ã¢ÂÂGb of sequence per cell line with a mean depth of 67 fold and with 90% of the targeted bases which have a QPhred score > 30.

Characterizing the genome wide me thylation state of cfDNA is a powerful and economical biomarker that can be used for providing an effective means to monitor disease and treatment efficacy. The challenges in performing deep sequencing of cfDNA include: a requirement for fast turnaround times due to sample degradation issues, li mited sample material, short DNA fragments <170 bp, and limit of detection issues caused by both normal and tumor DNA being present. This study de scribes a novel library preparation suitable for the Illumina platforms that requires only 10 million sequencing reads making it cost effective, sensitive, and specific to assess the methylation status of cfDNA. To characterize the methylation status of cfDNA, NGS libraries were genera ted utilizing a chemistry that sequentially ligates the adapters to each end of the DNA molecules. As the library is generated after bisulfite treatment, a high recovery of DNA library molecules is observed, thus enabling high complexity library preparation from 5 ng of cfDNA. Preliminary analysis of the hypomethylation status of the cfDNA from 8 can cer subjects ranged from 0.4% to 44% when compared to a set of healthy controls. The cfDNA sample with 0.4% hypomethylation originated from the plasma of a subject with a high grade serous adenocarconima in the fallo pian tube, and it believed that this tumor type sheds very little DNA into the blood compartment.

Circulating miRNA molecules were identified in different body fluids, and in many cancer types their expression reflected expression in tumor cells. In our study we used qT PCR to assay peripheral blood serum of 22 CLL patients for the expression of 84 miRNAs which were associated with diffe rentiation and maturation of B and T lymphocytes. We have found that the general expression of examined miRNAs in CLL pati ents was lower when compared to the expression levels in serum of healthy volunteers. Only miR 32a 5p, miR31 5p, miR 155 5p, miR 150 5p, miR 15a 3p and miR 29a 3p were expressed on higher level. Considering prognostic factors, the most important differences in miRNA expression were observed among patients depending on B2M level, CD38 expression status, and ab errations of chromosomes 12 and 13. When the functional miRNA groups were considered, the important factors for all examined groups included age, CD38 expression, NOTCH1 status and the status of chromosomes 11 and 12. Interestingly, neither ZAP70 expression, nor TP53 gene status were differentiating factors. Alterations in circulating miRNA expression in CLL patients affected miRNAs associated both with B and T lymphocyte differentiation, which proves the role of the latter cells in leukemogenesis.

Circadian rhythms are influenced by the expression of clock genes, which are controlled by a feedback mechanism that allows a rhythmic variation during 24 hours. Various evidences indicate that clock genes are important in neoplastic transformation. NPAS2 (MOP4) is a clock gene that can act as a tumor suppressor. We are searching for the presence of polymorphisms in the 5Ã¢ÂÂ region of NPAS2 . By using Sanger sequencing and capillary electropho resis, we found a polymorphic GGC repeat in the untranslated (first) exon of NPAS2. Allele and genotype frequencies of the GGC repeat were measu red in 72 subjects affected by melanoma and 77 controls. In both groups four alleles were present, with 7, 9, 12 and 13 GGC repeats. Alleles 7 and 9 were the most frequent (either having a frequency > 40% in controls or melanoma subjects). In both groups allele and genotype frequencies were in Hardy Weinberg equilibrium. In terms of allelic frequencies no statistical difference was found between melanoma and control subjects. In contrast, significant differences were found in genotype frequencies. In particular, the genotype 7/9 was more frequent in controls (57.1%) than in melanoma subjects (34.7%) (p: 0.0084); the genotype 9/9 was more frequent in me lanoma subjects (26.3%) than in controls (9.0%) (p: 0.0087).

Introduction: Biallelic germline mutations in the mismatch repair (MMR) genes cause a recessive form of childhood cancer that has been referred to as Constitutional Mismatch Repair Deficiency (CMMR D) syndrome. Family members of CMMR D patients are at risk of being a heterozygous MMR mu tation carrier and thus for having Lynch syndrome (LS). The cancer risks for these family members have not yet been analyzed. It is expected that their cancer risk will be different than cancer risks reported before for LS families that were ascertained because of cancer in the family. CMMR D families have not been ascertained because of cancer in the family, but because the index patient has a distinct phenotype. Methodology: Data collection of CMMR D families started in 2014 and is still in process. In the first half of 2016 a competing risks analysis will be perfor med to calculate cancer risks for family members up to the 6th degree. For family members of whom the carrier status is unknown, the probability of carriership will be computed based on the distance to obligate carriers and phenotypes in the family. Results: Thus far we have collected data on 46 PMS2, 15 MSH6, 4 MSH2 and 6 MLH1 families of CMMR D patients including 1764 family members. This numbers includes 340 proven and obligate heterozygote mutation carriers, 104 proven non carriers and 1220 non tested family members. Data analy sis will be done at a preliminary basis. Conclusion: Analysis of cancer risks in CMMR D families are relevant for ap propriate screening advice for family members and MMR mutation carriers detected through population based screening.",2015

Most CRCs develop from preneoplastic asymptomatic le sions known as colorectal adenoma (CRA). We have previously summarized the associations between common genetic variants and CRC in a field syn opsis of genetic association and GWAS, but the genetic basis of CRA is less well documented. We now present the first synthesis of all published gene tic association data for CRAs and the results of meta analyses to summarise risk estimates. Methods: Using Medline and the HuGENet phenopediaÃ¢ÂÂ¢, we identified and synthesized all published genetic association data for CRAs. We conducted meta analyses of the identified studies and data from two GWAS to sum marise risk estimates. We applied the Venice criteria and Bayesian False Discovery Probability (BFDP) to assess the levels of the credibility of asso ciations. Results: 9750 titles and abstracts were initially screened, and 1750 publi cations were identified for full text screening of which 130 articles met the inclusion criteria.

This is the first study that uses bioinformatic tools for CNA analysis in cytogenetic subtypes of pediatric ALL based on DNA methylation data. The Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450 Bead Array was applied for 756 diagnostic ALL samples and 50 controls. The signals from the array were first normalized using functional normalization and then segmented using the circular binary algorithm.

Although it prolongs survival, it can cause severe toxicity, especially diarrhea and neutropenia, in patients who carry the UGT1A1*28 allele. This study evaluates the cost effectiveness of UGT1A1 genotyping prior to irinotecan based chemotherapy in order to prevent adverse side effects from the perspective of the German statutory health insurance. A decision analytic Markov model with a life time horizon was developed. No testing was compared to (1) dose reduction of irinotecan based chemo therapy and (2) administration of a prophylactic G CSF growth factor for patients with a UGT1A1*28 variant. Probability, utility and cost parameters used in this study were extracted from published literature. Uncertainty was assessed by deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses. Strategy (1) dominated all remaining strategies. Compared to no testing, it resulted in only marginal QALY increases but a cost reduction of Ã¢ÂÂ¬600 per patient. Strategy (2) resulted in the same health gains but increased costs by Ã¢ÂÂ¬11,000. Deterministic sensitivity analysis shows that uncertainty for this strategy originated primarily from costs for irinotecan based chemothera py, from the prevalence of neutropenia among heterozygous patients, and from whether dose reduction is applied to both homozygotes and heterozy gotes or only to the former. This model based synthesis of the most recent evidence suggests that phar macogenetic UGT1A1 testing prior to irinotecan based chemotherapy do minates non personalized colon cancer care in Germany.

Susceptibility cancer gene panels allow simulta neous analysis of multiple genes and broaden genetic diagnosis compared to sequential single testing. Patients and Methods: Two hundred BRCA1/2 negative patients from HBOC families were enrolled for massive sequencing of 98 cancer susceptibility genes. Inclusion criteria were BC <35y, presence of OC <50y or at least 3 BC/OC <60y in the family. DNA samples were processed using AgilentÃ¢ÂÂs Sure Select Target Enrichment and sequenced on an Illumina MiSeq. Bioinforma tic pipeline includes read alignment, variant calling (GATK and VarScan2), and annotation (ANNOVAR and ALAMUT).Results: In the 49 families sequenced to date we identified 12 truncating variants in PALB2 (2) , ATM (2) , BARD1, FANCA, FANCE, FANCI, FANCL, PTEN, SLX4 and XRCC2, one missense variant in TP53, and 25 variants predicted as probably pathogenic by bioinformatic analysis: 17 (missense) affecting pro tein function and eight affecting splicing (six missense, one synonymous and one small deletion of a consensus splice site). So far, the gene panel was cli nically beneficial for four patients with deleterious variants in PALB2 , PTEN, and TP53 . Phenotypically, these families had one in situ BC with 1 first de gree with BC, both under age 35 (TP53), young onset BC with family history of BC and OC (PTEN), or an extensive family history of BC (2 PALB2 ).

Results: In 174 patients only one new firm diagnosis was established. In addition, in another 14 cases (8.0%), a pathogenic variant was detected in 6 different autosomal dominant genes traditionally associated with cancer types that did not match the cancer family history. Of these 14 mutations, 10 were actionable. We identified 414 VOUS of which 38 (9.2%) in autosomal dominant genes that were likely pathogenic. In the GoNL controls, 22 (4.4%) pathogenic and 740 VOUS were identified of which 85 (11.4%) were classi fied as likely pathogenic. Conclusions: Use of an extended gene panel did not instantly increase the number of molecular diagnoses explaining the cancer family history. Fur thermore, many likely pathogenic variants were identified in both our pa tient and control groups, suggesting that these variants are less relevant in familial cancer diagnostics.

23952,"We report on the DNA sequencing results we obtained for a 54 year old female patient with suspected familial tumour syndrome. She presented with several tumours (lipoma, myoma, breast cysts) and fibromyalgia. The patientÃ¢ÂÂs mother died at the age of 57 of breast cancer. Her maternal grand mother died of a brain tumour. In addition, several family members present with lung cancer (all smokers). We performed NGS using the TruSight Cancer Panel (Illumina, total of 94 cancer genes). The analysis revealed a heteroallelic frameshift mutation in the FANCG gene: p. A495Qfs*23. No further mutation was detected in the genes covered by the panel, which includes all known breast cancer suscep tibility genes and all known Fanconi anemia genes. Unfortunately, no DNA samples of the patientÃ¢ÂÂs mother and grandmother are available for segrega tion analyses. FANCG is one of the three most commonly mutated genes out of 13 genes coding for proteins active in the same DNA repair pathway, that may lead to Fanconi anemia (FA) when biallelically mutated (exception: FANCB, X reces sive inheritance). FA is a chromosome instability syndrome characterized by childhood anemia, susceptibility to leukemia and cancer. Monoallelic mutations with increased susceptibility for breast cancer have been reported for only few FA genes: FANCD1 (BRCA2), FANCN (PALB2), FANCJ (BRIP1) and very recently FANCM. We consider the possibility that the FANCG mutation detected in our patient may underlie the familial tu mour syndrome in her family and suggest FANCG heterozygosity as a novel breast cancer susceptibility factor.",2015
23953,"Fanconi anemia (FA) is a rare autosomal or X linked recessive disease which displays a heterogeneous phenotype. Besides congenital developmental de fects, FA is characterized by bone marrow failure and genomic instability resulting in cancer predisposition. Due to a DNA repair defect the cellular phenotype is characterized by hypersensitivity to DNA crosslinking agents, leading to increased chromosomal breakage, reduced cell survival and G2 phase arrest in the cell cycle. Currently 16 FA genes (FANCA, B, C, D1, D2, E, F, G, I, J, L, N, O, P , Q and S ), whose products are members of the FA/BRCA pathway, were reported to be causative for FA. Based on the asso ciation of corresponding mutations with the loss or retention of FANCD2/FANCI monoubiquitination, these genes are classified as upstream or down stream FA genes. In one cell line derived from an FA patient we detected a homozygous single nucleotide exchange in an FA candidate gene, which is a member of the FA/BRCA pathway but not an FA gene. The mutation results in an amino acid substitution at a conserved position. This cell line exhibits reduced levels of FANCD2 monoubiquitination and FANCD2 foci formation as well as MMC induced G2 phase arrest in the cell cycle. Complementation with the wild type form of this gene rescues the MMC sensitivity and normal cell cycle progress. In addition, FANCD2 monoubiquitination and FANCD2 foci formation were raised. Currently, we are generating animal and human cell models in order to draw closer connections to the FA/BRCA pathway.",2015
23954,"FAAP100 is a component of the Fanconi anemia (FA) nuclear core complex. Together with FANCL and FANCB it forms a subcomplex, which is necessary for the monoubiquitination of FANCD2 and FANCI and the stability of the core complex. Chicken DT40 cells that are faap100 deficient show a cellular phenotype similar to human FA cells, which includes reduced mitomycin C induced cell survival and increased chromosomal breakage rates as well as compromised FANCD2 monoubiquitination. In order to generate an FAAP100 deficient cell line we used the recently dis covered RNA guided CRISPR Cas9 system. The CRISPR Cas9 technology for genome engineering is based on the adaptive immune system of bacteria and archaea. This system can be applied to introduce DNA double strand breaks at a target sequence into genomic DNA similar to ZFN nucleases and TALENS. After DSBs have been elicited, the damage can be repaired through error prone non homologous end joining (NHEJ) or through error free ho mology directed repair (HDR) if a homologous DNA template is available. In our work, we targeted exon 5 of FAAP100 in U2OS cells. Initial experiments revealed that the CRISPR Cas9 tool is suitable for tackling FAAP100 in U2OS cells and that stable InDel mutations were introduced through NHEJ. Cur rently we are trying to isolate single cell clones with a deleterious mutation and to grow an FAAP100 null cell line for further experiments including im munoblots, analysis of chromosomal breakage and cell cycle analysis.",2015
23955,"Fanconi anemia (FA) is a rare X linked or autosomal recessive genetic disor der, characterized by a broad genetic and clinical heterogeneity. Molecular testing is impeded by the presence of at least 16 genes, which are compo nents of the FA/BRCA pathway (FANCA, B, C, D1, D2, E, F, G, I, J, L, N, O, P , Q, S). Stringent genotype phenotype correlations are usually not applicable to these FA subtypes. A majority of patients belong to the complementation groups FA A, C and G. For several rare subgroups only a few patients have been identified so far. Long term phenotype genotype data collection of these minor subgroups is essential for a better understanding of the molecular roles of the correspon ding proteins as well as for the clinical management of those patients. Here we report on a 49 year old patient who belongs to the rare and unu sual subgroup FA Q. Causative are biallelic mutations in the ERCC4/XPF gene. Other mutations in this gene have been associated with Xeroderma pigmentosum, Cockayne syndrome or a progeria syndrome (XF E). Unlike most individuals with FA our patient never developed bone marrow failure or malignancies, typical features of other FA patients at that age. Interestin gly, she shows skin photosensitivity to sunlight, a trait previously not seen in FA patients of other complementation groups except for one of the two pre viously described FA Q patients. Hence, sunlight sensitivity in unclassified FA patients may give a hint for their assignment to complementation group FA Q such that mutations in ERCC4 should be tested preferentially.",2015

The goal of this study is to investigate the as sociation between 1377G/A (rs2234767) and 670A/G (rs1800682) poly morphisms in Fas and single nucleotide polymorphisms 844C/T (rs763110) in FasL in a breast cancer samples. The study group consists of 254 subjects, including 122 patients with breast cancer and 132 healthy controls. DNA extracted from peripheral blood was analyzed by TaqMan real time PCR and allelic discrimination assay. We have found a significant association between patients with aberrant A allele in genotype for FAS 1377 SNP and larger size of tumors compared to GG genotype carriers (p,0.0356). Moreover patients with FAS 1377A and FASL 844T genotype showed significant association to poorly differentiated breast cancer specimens of higher tumor grade (G2+G3) (p,0.0378 and p,0.0001, respectively). Patients with FAS 1377A and FAS 670G genotype showed significant association to positive expres sion status of progesterone receptor (p,0.0263 and p,0.0169, respective ly). The significant association was observed also between the FAS 670G and FASL 844T genotypes with HER 2 positive status (p, 0.0177 and p, 0.0009, respectively). These data suggest that functional polymorphisms in the death pathway genes FAS and FASL may contribute to the occurrence of breast cancer and modify its biological profile in Slovak population.

Introduction: In a previous study (EPIC Eurgast) of association between ge netic variation in candidate genes and gastric cancer (GC) risk we observed several associations that required replication in independent populations. Methods: 96 SNPs from 57 genes that in the EPIC Eurgast study were found associated with GC or any of its subtypes were genotyped (Fluidigm SNPty pe assays) in 328 non EPIC GC cases and 322 healthy controls from different Spanish regions, as well as 375 GC cases and 709 controls from the North of Portugal. Associations were analyzed using unconditional logistic regressi on. Results: Unless otherwise stated, the results indicated are those obtained in the combined analysis of both the Spanish and the Portuguese populations, under the additive model. These results confirmed previously reported as sociations between GC and PSCA rs2294008 (OR,1,21; 95%CI:1,06 1,40) and MUC1 rs4072037 (OR,0,82; 95%CI:0,72 0,94). Furthermore, asso ciations with GC were replicated in another six genes. DRD4 rs12280580 (OR,0.83;95%CI: 0,72 0,97), VEGFA rs833060 (OR,0,84;95%CI:0,72 0,97), TFF3 rs8133510 (OR,0,75;95%CI:0,61 0,93; AG vs GG) and MIRLE T7I rs10877888 (OR,1.29;95%CI:1,00 1,65; recessive model), were asso ciated with GC in general.

Variants in genes for cell signalling (DRD4 and VEGFA), mucosa protection (TFF3), region of MIRLET7I (micro RNA let7i), blood group (ABO) and carcinogen metabolism (NQO1), also are associated with GC or its histological/anatomical subtypes in European populations.(Acknowledgements: ISCIII PI12/01187 and PS09/00213)",2015
23958,"Introduction: Decreased 25 hydroxy (25 OH) vitamin D levels have been associated with prostate cancer, but it is unclear whether this association is causal. To examine the hypothesized inverse relationship between vitamin D status and prostate cancer we performed a Mendelian randomization study and studied the association between a common single nucleotide po lymorphism (SNP) strongly associated with 25 OH vitamin D and prostate cancer. Material and Methods: Genotypes of the group specific component gene (GC, rs2282679) were determined in the prospective PROCAGENE study comprising 702 prostate cancer patients with a median follow up of 82 months. Logistic regression was used to estimate the associations between the genetic variants and biochemical recurrence, development of metastasis and mortality of prostate. Results: GC genotypes were not associated with biochemical recurrence (HR 0.89, 95% CI 0.70 1.13; p , 0.32), development of metastases (HR 1.20, 95% CI 0.88 1.63; p , 0.25) or overall survival (HR 1.10; 95% CI 0.84 1.43; p , 0.50).Conclusion: We conclude that a causal role of vitamin D status, reflected by the GC polymorphism, in prostate cancer is unlikely.",2015

Information about the frequency and spectrum of TP53 mutations in the russian pathients with diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLB CL) in the current version of the IARC TP53 Mutation Database R17 is not represented. The goal of this work was to study the frequency, spectrum and functional significance of TP53 mutations in russian patients with DLBCL. Material and Methods: At the present time the pilot group of 14 patients were included in the study. Diagnosis was assessed according to the criteria of the WHO classification system. Genomic DNA was isolated from formalin fixed, paraffin embedded tissue blocks. Direct sequence analysis of gene TP53 was performed according to the IARC protocol, 2010 update. Results: In two patients were identified single nucleotide substitutions that are not described in the current version of the PubMed database. All of mutations occurred in the DNA binding domain of p53. The nonsense mutation Arg196Ter was detected in one patient. Previously it was shown that formation of this premature stop codon might activate the nonsense mediated RNA decay pathway. The second patient had two missense mutati ons Leu130Phe and Arg156Cys. The first of them leads to p53 inactivation according to the analysis of the functional importance of amino acid substi tutions using service PolyPhen 2. Conclusions: We detected TP53 mutation in 14% cases. The mutational rate in our study is in good agreement with other studies where the frequency of the TP53 mutations in patients with DLBCL ranged mostly from 13 to 23%.",2015
23960,"Similar to most cancers, males have a higher risk than females for childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). To gain insight into the genetic basis of this difference, we performed a case only GWAS to identify gender specific risk markers among 240 ALL cases recruited at Texas ChildrenÃ¢ÂÂs Cancer Center using the Illumina Infinium HumanCoreExome Chip. Results were ranked both by statistical significance and effect size, and then subjected to bioinformatics analysis to evaluate relevant pathways and potential under lying mechanisms. RASSF2 rs4813720 yielded the statistically most signi ficant result for interaction with sex (OR , 0.29; P , 2E 06). Two HLA DQA1 missense SNPs (rs12722042 and rs12722039) and ADAM28 rs11992342 yielded the largest effect sizes (OR > 14.0; P < 0.05). The HLA DQA1 SNPs correspond to DQA1*01:07, and their association with risk confirms a pre viously reported male specific association with DQA1*01. No sex chromoso me variant appeared to be involved in the interaction of risk with sex. While bioinformatic screening of our top hits did not implicate a particular mecha nism for male specific risk, RASSF2 has an estrogen receptor alpha binding site in its promoter. Additionally, a functional SNP among our top hits (by P value) in (MAGI2 rs798292) is associated with expression of KAT7 in lym phoblastoid cells (P , 2E 08), which is a histone acetyltransferase that re presses androgen receptor mediated transcription. Our results suggest that autosomal variants are likely to underlie the sex differential in childhood ALL risk. Our approach and results provide a foundation for further studies to fully characterize the sex differential in childhood ALL risk.",2015

23963,"Introduction: The head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is ran king as the fifth most common cancer worldwide and it is also the second leading cause of cancer deaths in the South East Asia region, including Tai wan. The major risk factors associated with HNSCC are smoking, alcohol consumption, and human papillomavirus subtype 16 (HPV 16) infection. However, most of the HNSCC patients in Taiwan were HPV 16 infection ne gative. This implicates that genetic variants underlying the HNSCC in Taiwan might be different from other populations. To obtain a comprehensive over view of genetic alternations underlying HNSCC, we applied whole exome sequencing on HNSCC patients. Methods: Nine pairs of tumor and adjacent normal tissue samples with sta ge III IV HNSCC were obtained from the Tissue Bank of the TPEVGH. DNA were captured using SureSelect Human All Exon kit and Illumina Paired End Sequencing Library Prep, then were sequenced by Illumina Genome Analy zer IIx platform. Results: In total, 1788 novel variants, including 676 missense, 146 synony mous, 61 nonsense, and 7 splicing site variants, were identified (with an average 199 variants per patient, range 51 532 variants). Genetic variants on ninety nine genes were recurrently found in maximally two patients. Five out of nine HNSCC patients carried the TP53 novel variants. Most of the variants are located on the PI3K, MAPK, EGFR, and NOTCH pathways, while some of them are oncogenes, tumor suppressor genes, and DNA repair genes. Conclusion: Using exome sequencing, we identified several candidate genes for HNSCC predisposition. Their contribution to HNSCC will be further inve stigated by using larger cohort of patients with HNSCC.",2015

In a cohort of 301 Danish families with mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 we assessed the risk of cancer in male mutation carriers and first degree relatives in relation to a sex matched and birth matched control po pulation. Results Men in BRCA1 families were not at increased risk of cancer, except for a trend for prostate cancer before age 65, whereas men in BRCA2 fami lies were at increased risk of male breast cancer and prostate cancer. Male BRCA2 mutation carriers were at a cumulative risk of 11% for breast cancer 19% for prostate cancer. Male breast cancers developed at a mean age of 59 years and were typically ER/PR positive ductal carcinomas. Prostate can cer developed with a HR of 4.0 (p<0.001) in mutation carriers and a HR 3.3 (p,0.001) in first degree relatives. The BRCA2 associated prostate cancers developed at a mean age of 68 years and were frequently high grade with Gleason scores Ã¢ÂÂ¥8 in 22% of the tumors.

23966,"Introduction Hereditary diffuse gastric cancer (HDGC) is a rare, severe, highly penetrant and difficult to diagnose syndrome. Forty five percent of HDGC families are associated with germline CDH1/E cadherin coding alterations.1 3 Other susceptibility genes were recently implicated in ~5% of CDH1 negative fa milies.4 Of the 50% that remain without molecular diagnosis, 2/3 present germline monoallelic CDH1 downregulation5,6 and >90% display loss of E cadherin expression in tumours.7 HDGC families lacking CDH1 coding mu tations may harbour causative germline alterations in non coding regions. Material and MethodsThe entire CDH1 locus was sequenced from the germline DNA of 90 HDGC probands without mutations in classically screened regions. Bioinformatics criteria were used to prioritize novel NCVs to be evaluated from a biological standpoint: 1) chromatin status from the adjoining region; 2) occurrence in putatively transcribed regions; 3) conservation level; and 4) predicted crea tion/deletion of repressors/enhancers consensus sequences. Results and DiscussionThirty rare heterozygous germline CDH1 NCVs were sorted out as putative ly disease causative for 25% of CDH1 negative probands. NCVs were clu stered in silico suggesting the existence of two different pathways impac ting gene expression: 1) promoter/enhancer related variants that create/eliminate binding sites for CDH1 expression repressors/enhancers; and 2) transcription related variants that may impair the normal CDH1 locus expression pattern. This hypothesis will be biologically addressed in order to confirm NCVs impact in CDH1 expression. Any pathogenic alteration will warrant a complete redefinition of the screening methodology currently ap plied to HDGC families, providing simultaneously important insights for the understanding of CDH1 expression regulation.

23967,"The HLA region is well recognized as the regulator of immune response, but is less known for its non HLA gene content. Besides having the highest gene density in the genome, the HLA region also has remarkable gene diversi ty. A particular subregion in the HLA class I region contains a number of candidate cancer susceptibility genes and a large number of ncRNA genes. Using disease association databases, we screened SNPs from the overlap ping genes CCHCR1/TCF19/POU5F1 and flanking regions (chr6:30.9 31.4Mb) correlated with cancer susceptibility, and annotated them to assess their causality. At the statistical significance threshold of 0.0001, there were independent associations (rs6457327, rs1634718, rs130067, rs2596503, rs3130544, rs7750641) with lung/breast/cervical/prostate cancers, non Hodgkin lymphoma, and glioma. The lung cancer associated SNPs were not in LD (r2<0.50) with the primary lung cancer risk marker BAG6 rs3117582. Each one of these SNPs had a RegulomeDB score <2b and/or CADD C score >2.5, suggesting high functionality, although none of the cancer associated SNPs in the region were deleterious to protein function. When their statisti cally similar (r2>0.8) SNP sets were examined, they also had high functiona lity scores (C scores up to 15.8; RegulomeDB scores up to 1f). Most of these SNPs were eQTLs for ncRNAs in this subregion (linc00243 which derives from IER3; HCG22 which is expressed exclusively in lymphoid tissues, lung, breast, prostate, brain and few other tissues). These data suggest that the subregion of HLA class I region examined in this survey contains multiple independent cancer susceptibility risk for multiple cancer types, which may act via modifying the activity of ncRNA content.",2015

This mutation was found in myeloproliferative disorders (MPDs) especially in polycythemia vera (PV) and essential throm bocythemia (ET). In addition, MPDs represent a risk factor for development of thrombosis that is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in patients. Materials and Methods: We aimed to consider the correlation between JAK2 mutation and thrombosis. Thirty nine patients who had clinical diagnosis as thrombocytosis and Budd Chiari syndrome from 2010 to 2014 were collec ted to determine JAK2 V617F mutation. DNA from all specimens were am plified and detected the presence of JAK2 V617F mutation by AS PCR. Results: In this study, we demonstrated JAK2 V617F mutation in both pa tients who had clinical diagnosis as thrombocytosis and Budd Chiari syn drome. We found that 11 of 37 (29.7%) thrombocytosis patients had JAK2 V617F mutation. Moreover, one of two patients who had represent as Budd Chiari syndrome was detected JAK2 V617F mutation. Conclusions: JAK2 V617F mutation has associated with thrombosis. Howe ver, further study in large series is needed to support. Determination of the JAK2 V617F mutation may be useful for screening latent or occult MPDs pa tients who have occurrence of thrombosis to adjust the appropriate treat ment for good patient outcome.",2015

Li Fraumeni syndrome (LFS) is a remarkable cancer predisposition charac terised by extensive clinical heterogeneity. We performed, in the context of a national study, a clinical update from the mutation carriers that we iden tified over the last 20 years. From 1730 patients suggestive of LFS, we iden tified 415 mutation carriers in 214 families harbouring 133 distinct TP53 alterations. The 322 affected carriers developed 552 tumours and 43% had developed multiple malignancies. The mean age of first tumour onset was 24.9 years, 41% being affected by age 18. In childhood, the LFS tumour spectrum was characterised by osteosarcomas, adrenocortical carcinomas (ACC), central nervous system tumours, and soft tissue sarcomas (STS) observed in 30, 27, 26 and 23% of the patients, respectively. In adults, the presentation was characterised by the predominance of breast carcinomas observed in 79% of the females, and STS observed in 27% of the patients. The TP53 mutation detection rate in children with ACC or choroid plexus carcinomas, and in females with breast cancer before 31, without additional features indicative of LFS, was 45%, 42% and 6%, respectively. The mean age of tumour onset was statistically different (p<0.05) between carriers harbouring dominant negative missense mutations (21.3 years) and those with all types of loss of function mutations (28.5 years) or genomic rearran gements (35.8 years).

The clinical gradient of the germline TP53 mutations suggests that it might be appropriate to stratify the clinical management of LFS according to the class of the mutation.",2015
23970,"IntroductionLiposarcomas are a heterogeneous group of malignant adipocytic neoplasms that consist of 3 distinct clinicopathological entities: well differentiated/de differentiated liposarcoma, myxoid liposarcoma, and pleomorphic liposar coma. Dedifferentiated liposarcoma (DDLPS) results from the progression of a well differentiated liposarcoma (WDLPS) to a nonlipogenic sarcoma of variable histologic grades and morphologic patterns that acquires metasta tic potential. Our objective is to a correlate between Real Time PCR (RT PCR), fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) and Immunohistochemistry (IHC) for detection of MDM2 gene amplification in WDLPS and DDLPS. Methods15 cases of liposarcoma were selected from the Pathological Anatomy ser vice to make this correlation. Diagnosis is based on a standard histology. Immunohistochemical confirmation was carried out by the antibodies anti MDM2 and anti CDK4. The amplification of MDM2 was performed by FISH and RT PCR. ResultsThe average age of patients is 54 years, ranging from 27 to 75 years with a slight female predominance.8 cases of tumors are diagnosed WDLPS and 7 other cases DDLPS. These tumors are characterized by a heterogeneous aspect of malignant cells and positivity of anti MDM2 and anti CDK4 antibodies. MDM2 amplification by FISH was found in 6 of 15 liposarcoma cases ((3/8) of WDLPS and (3/7) of DDLPS) and in 7 cases by RT PCR ((3/8) of WDLPS and (4/7) of DDLPS) something which shows more than 85% concordance between the two tech niques knowing the sensitivity of FISH is higher than that of the RT PCR. ConclusionsMDM2 amplification has been shown to have high sensitivity in characteri zing WDLPS and DDLPS. Differences in MDM2 amplification profiles among liposarcomas could help further define and predict progression to high grade neoplasia.",2015
23971,"IntroductionRecent progress in the analysis of cell free DNA fragments (cell free circula ting tumor DNA, ctDNA) now allows monitoring of tumor genomes by non invasive means. However, previous studies with plasma DNA from patients with cancer demonstrated highly variable allele frequencies of ctDNA. The comprehensive analysis of tumor genomes is greatly facilitated when plas ma DNA has increased amounts of ctDNA. Therefore, a fast and cost effective pre screening method to identify such plasma samples without previous knowledge about alterations in the respective tumor genome could assist in the selection of samples suitable for further extensive qualitative analysis. MethodsTo address this, we adapted the recently described FAST SeqS method, which was originally established as a simple and effective, non invasive screening method for fetal aneuploidy from maternal blood. Results We show that our modified FAST SeqS method (mFAST SeqS) can be used as a pre screening tool for an estimation of the ctDNA percentage. Plasma samples with an mFAST SeqS z score above 5 showed highly concordant results compared to copy number profiles obtained from our previously described plasma Seq approach. Therefore, mFAST SeqS revealed a general overview about the aneuploidy status of the tumor genome on the resoluti on of chromosome arms. Conclusion Advantages of this approach include that no prior knowledge about the ge netic composition of tumor samples is necessary in order to identify bet ween plasma DNA samples with more than 10% of ctDNA content, and the speed and cost effectiveness of the assay.",2015
23972,"Background: Lung cancer is a leading cause of death. Non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) accounts for approximately 85% of all cases. Platinum based therapy is used as standard treatment for patients with NSCLC. The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) has been shown to play an impor tant role in the growth and survivor of many solid tumors, including NSCLC. GeÃ¯Â¬Âtinib and erlotinib are EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR TKI) that blocks the signal transduction pathways implicated in the proliferation and survival of cancer cells. Little is known about other pharmacogenetic vari ants in NSCLC. Methods: We performed DNA analysis on 19 patients with NSCLC. Tumor sample DNA was extracted from formalin fixed paraffin embedded samples. The samples were NGS sequenced using Illumina cancer panel (96 genes and 256 variants) by MiSeq instrument. The pharmacogenetic significance of our variants was evaluated using the information from PharmGKB data base. Results: Pharmacogenetic variants were found in different genes: ERCC2 (63% of the samples), TP53 (74%), XPC (68%). These variants define NS CLC as sensitive to treatment with the platinum based therapy. Another va riant in EGFR gene (EGFR R497K) sensitive to EGFR TKI was found in 47% of the samples by NGS sequencing. These variants canÃ¢ÂÂt be detected by the current IVD labelled real time PCR assays for NSCLC target therapy. Conclusion: Our data shows that next generation sequencing tests reveals a new useful information for the personalized therapy of NSCLC.",2015
23973,"The major histocompatibility complex (MHC) was strongly implicated in the development of lung cancers in animal experiments. Lung cancers show the highest number of cancer associations with human MHC (HLA) region. For a systematic analysis, we extracted 73 SNPs located within chromosome 6: 29 to 33Mb and associated with lung cancer from the GWAS catalog, dbGAP , and GRASP database (P<5E 04), of which 59 exceeded the genome wide statisti cal significance threshold (P < 5E 08). Only three of those were listed in the GWAS catalog (rs3117582, rs3817963, rs2395185), with BAG6 rs3117582 being the most consistently observed. Associations were with squamous ABSTRACTS POSTERS ESHG 2015 | GLASGOW, SCOTLAND, UK | WWW. ESHG. ORG 256Back to inde x cell and adenocarcinoma, as well as lung cancers in never smoked women. These SNPs also show associations with Hodgkin lymphoma, breast, and prostate cancers. Three SNPs occur as somatic mutations in breast and co lon cancers (rs7750641, rs3749971, rs3134942). Two SNPs (rs3117582, rs1150752) map into CgG islands, one (rs9276472) is within 500bp of a microRNA sequence (MIR3135B), three in non coding RNA genes, and two are deleterious missense variants (rs9262143, rs7775397) in KIAA1949 and C6orf10. Only one SNP was in an HLA gene (rs2187668, HLA DQA1, non coding) and none were in a sequence encoding peptide binding region of HLA molecules. However, 35 of the 73 SNPs scored the highest gene regu latory function in RegulomeDB analysis. Most notably, rs3117582 and its six statistically indistinguishable (r2 , 1) and 41 statistically similar (r2 > 0.8) SNPs had high levels of functionality. These results strongly suggest that the HLA region contains multiple lung cancer susceptibility markers acting via more than one and non immune related mechanism.",2015
23974,"Introduction: In up to 50% of suspected Lynch syndrome (LS) families with typical signs of mismatch repair (MMR) defect in tumor tissue, no germline mutation in the MMR genes can be detected. Loss of function copy number variants (CNVs) in these patients might give a hint to yet unidentified genes responsible for LS. Methods: Genomic DNA from 81 unrelated mutation negative patients from the German HNPCC Consortium and four patients from the Netherlands was genotyped. Putative CNVs were identified and filtered according to stringent criteria to select rare, non polymorphic deletions and duplications. Candi date genes in validated CNVs were screened for germline point mutations by a targeted NGS approach in 44 patients. Results: In total, 30 deletions and 18 duplications encompassing 71 protein coding genes were found in 35 patients. Five of these genes are promising candidate genes that are highly expressed in normal colorectal tissue. Three of these genes are involved in cell adhesion, cell development and transfor mation, cell cycle checkpoint regulation, and cell volume or polarity control. One is involved in double strand break repair and recombination and the last one possesses DNA helicase activity. Analysis of NGS data is still ongoing. Conclusion: By applying stringent filter criteria we identified a group of rare, non recurrent loss of function CNVs which might contain novel predispo sing genes for LS. The ongoing NGS analysis will reveal whether there are also point mutations in one of these genes confirming a possible causative effect for LS.

23975,"A 43 years old male was diagnosed with two primary colorectal cancers (CRC). The family fulfilled the Amsterdam criteria, with a father and pater nal grandmother with CRC at age 57 and 50, respectively. A sister was dia gnosed with a colorectal adenoma at age 42.The CRCs of both our index and his father were MSI high with lack of nuclear staining of MSH2. Neither a germline mutation in MSH2 or MSH6 nor a copy number alteration in EPCAM and the intergenic region between EPCAM and MSH2 was detected. In the 3Ã¢ÂÂUTR of EPCAM, about 280 nt upstream of the poly adenylation signal, a heterozygous variant was present: c.*136C>G. Hy permethylation of the MSH2 promoter was found in both tumors and normal colon tissue, but not in peripheral blood or oral mucosa cells of our index pa tient, mimicking the situation in patients with a 3Ã¢ÂÂend EPCAM deletion. The heterozygous EPCAM variant cosegregated with hypermethylation of the MSH2 promoter in his father and sister. A Lynch like surveillance regimen was advised for all first degree relatives. Cosegregation of the EPCAM variant c.*136C>G with MSH2 promoter me thylation in the tumors indicate that an aberration in the EPCAM MSH2 lo cus other than a deletion of the polyadenylation signal of EPCAM can induce hypermethylation of the MSH2 promoter. Whether there is a causal relation between this variant and hypermethylation of the MSH2 promoter is currently unclear.",2015
23976,"Lynch syndrome caused by inherited MSH6 mutations is characterised by an increased cancer risk, predominantly of the bowel and endometrium. This case study describes a cluster of three endometrial cancers in first degree relatives, with the proband diagnosed at 60 years. Her mother and sister were diagnosed at 59 and 74 years, respectively. The probandÃ¢ÂÂs tumour sho wed loss of MSH2 and MSH6 protein immunostaining, but no mutations in either gene were identified by dHPLC and MLPA testing methods in 2008. Colonoscopy screening was initiated for the proband and close family mem bers according to Lynch syndrome guidelines. In 2014, MSH2 and MSH6 gene testing was repeated using Next Generation sequencing and a hetero zygous duplication of a single nucleotide in exon 5 of MSH6 was identified which was verified by fluorescent sequence analysis. This finding confirmed the diagnosis of Lynch syndrome in the proband and the need for bowel screening in this family. The result also enabled predictive gene testing in relatives and the exclusion from risk of some individuals found not to carry the familial mutation. This case study highlights the importance of Lynch syndrome testing in fa milies with endometrial cancer that do not meet clinical diagnostic criteria. It also shows 1) the utility of multi gene testing following aberrant immu nostaining results and 2) how updated genetic testing techniques can detect pathogenic mutations previously missed by older methods. The role of the Clinical Genetics professional in conveying new personal risk information derived from the use of updated technology is also discussed.",2015
23977,"Lynch Syndrome (LS) is characterized by mutations in the DNA mismatch repair genes MSH2, MLH1, MSH6, and PMS2. However, the identification of PMS2 specific mutations is complicated by the presence of PMS2 pseudo genes, along with the allelic diversity of the 3Ã¢ÂÂ region of PMS2, a complexity which has probably led to under reporting PMS2 gene mutations as a cau se of LS. Acting as a referral centre serving a population of >2m. people we have developed a technique to identify deleterious PMS2 gene mutations by combining MLPA analysis with SNP specific probes, along with methodology, adapted from Clendenning et al. (Human Mutation, 2006), utilizing genomic long range PCR enabling sequence analysis of both PMS2 and PMS2CL. Over the past two years 85 patients were referred to this centre for PMS2 analysis because of a personal and family cancer history, and/or mis match repair protein immunohistochemical (IHC) tumour analysis suggestive of LS. IHC findings were reviewed where available, along with tumour DNA for mi crosatellite instability, and leukocyte derived germline DNA was examined for PMS2 gene mutations.24 of the 85 referred patients demonstrated an isolated IHC loss of PMS2, 14 of the 24 (58%) proved to be PMS2 mutation positive, with 2 of the 24 demonstrating an MLH1 mutation. In the remaining 61 patients (primarily showing MLH1/PMS2 loss by IHC) no PMS2 gene mutations were identified. We propose that it is reasonable to limit PMS2 gene analysis to patients con sidered to be at risk of LS to those individuals who demonstrate isolated IHC loss of PMS2 protein.

23978,"Background: Lynch Syndrome (LS) arises from a germline mutation in MMR genes and predisposes to colorectal and uterine cancers (UC). The aim of this work was to deeply characterize the UC in LS. Methods: 29 LS UC and 38 sporadic cancer for comparison were studied for clinicopathological features, MMR IHC, MSI and MLH1 methylation. Results: The mean age at the UC diagnosis of LS patients was 46 years respect to patient with sporadic UC (55 years, p,0.007). BMI of LS patients was 24 (normal weight) respect to the patients with sporadic cancer (BMI,27,3; p,0.04). UC arose as first manifestation of the pathology in 34,5% of LS patients. Corpus of the uterus was the prevalent site of onset, while 3 LS UC arose in the Lower Uterine Segment (LUS) and 4 in the cervical canal. Most of the tumors showed an endometrioid histotype. Abundant tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) and peritumoral lymphocytes (PL) were observed in LS UC in comparison to the sporadic ones. IHC loss of at least one MMR protein was observed in 27 cases (93%), including 19 cases with MSH2 and/or MSH6 loss and 8 cases with MLH1 and PMS2 loss. MSI was detected in 27 cases (93%). Interestin gly, 4 LS UC presented also MLH1 promoter methylation. Conclusions: This study demonstrates that the evaluation of these clinico pathological and molecular features is an efficient strategy to identify LS and to refer those patients to the genetic counseling.",2015

It is characterised by predisposition to colorectal (CRC), endometrial and other cancers. Cancer surveillance and risk reduction strategies have been intro duced on the basis of cancer risks in MLH1 and MSH2 mutation carriers. However, emerging data suggest the cancer spectrum and penetrance may differ substantially between the MMR genes. Objectives: To review cancer penetrance and evidence for risk reducing in terventions in MMR mutation carriers, and to provide management recom mendations for carriers based on individualised cancer risks. Methods: A systematic literature review was conducted to identify relevant studies meeting inclusion and quality criteria. Using these data manage ment recommendations were then developed and implemented following a consensus meeting. Results: Available data supports gene specific management protocols for the MMR genes. We recommend colonoscopy at 18 monthly intervals starting at 25yrs for MLH1 and MSH2 carriers and 30yrs for MSH6 and PMS2 carriers. This is based on the reduced and later age dependent CRC penetrance for MSH6 and PMS2 carriers. We recommend female MLH1 and MSH2 carriers consider risk reducing hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo oophorectomy (BSO) from 40yrs, but available data does not support recommendation of BSO in premenopausal MSH6 and PMS2 carriers.

Hereditary melanoma is mainly caused by germline mutati ons in the CDKN2A gene (in approximately 39% of all families) and rarely in CDK4, BAP1 , POT1, MITF, and TERT genes. However, in more than half of the families the inherited mutations causing melanoma are still unknown.

23985,"Lynch syndrome (LS) is an autosomal dominant inherited cancer caused by a germline mutation in one of the DNA mismatch repair (MMR) genes: MLH1, MSH2 , MSH6, or PMS2 . Individuals with LS will commonly present with co lorectal cancer (CRC), however female carriers also have an increased risk of developing endometrial cancer (EC). It is important to distinguish LS pati ents from sporadic cancer patients in order for appropriate disease surveil lance and family members to be counselled. The Molecular Oncology Laboratory currently performs a number of genetic tests aimed at identifying these patients, including immunohistochemistry (IHC), microsatellite instability (MSI) and MLH1 promoter methylation. Methylation of specific regions of the promoter for the MLH1 gene results in epigenetic silencing of the gene and the patient may present with a similar clinical picture to a patient carrying a germ line MMR gene mutation. Iden tification of MLH1 methylation will indicate that LS is unlikely and that MMR gene mutation screening is not required. Methylation testing is carried out using a methylation sensitive multiplex ligation dependent probe amplification (MS MLPA) technique which targets 5 sites in the MLH1 promoter corresponding to regions A, B, C and D and intron 1. A review has been performed comparing the MLH1 methylation results at 5 sites in EC patients, with results in CRC patients. The incidence of EC patients with MLH1 methylation is 86%, with 97% of patients showing methylation across all 5 regions, compared with 74% of CRC patients.

A hallmark of these Ampliseq cancer panels is the low amount of input DNA needed which is critical when specimen mate rial is limited such as with needle biopsy or FFPE samples. Typically, 10 ng of DNA is sufficient to produce informative sequencing data. Often, cancer causing or promoting mutations are detected at low allele frequencies like 10 20 % compared to the normal allele. Many researchers wish to verify these low frequency mutations by an orthologous method such as Sanger sequencing on a capillary electrophoresis (CE) instrument. To that end, we have developed a workflow that enables the amplification and traditional Sanger sequencing of individual Ion AmpliSeq targets directly from the Am pliSeq library starting material.

Most intracranial MHPCs resemble meningiomas (MNGs) in their clinical presentation and histological features and may therefore be misdiagnosed, despite their important differences in progno sis. Methods: We report 8 cases of MHPC and 5 cases of MNG collected from 2007 to 2011 from the neuro Surgery and histopathology departments. All 13 samples were re reviewed by two independent pathologists and investi gated by immunohistochemistry (IHC) using mesenchymal, epithelial and neuro glial markers. Additionally, we screened all tumors for a large panel of chromosomal alterations using Multiplex Ligation Probe Amplification (MLPA). Presence of the NAB2 STAT6 fusion gene inferred by immunohisto chemical staining for STAT6.

There was no difference in mutation type: truncating v. missense, compared to the NF1 LOVD (23, 3, 2158, 288; Fishers exact, ns).[www.lovd.nl/NF1] Mutations were distributed from exons 6 54, not significantly different from those on the LOVD, and there was also no relationship with either the GRD or ATP binding domains.(FisherÃ¢ÂÂs exact).ABSTRACTS POSTERS ESHG 2015 | GLASGOW, SCOTLAND, UK | WWW. ESHG. ORG 260Back to inde x This is the first such study combining clinical and molecular data. We con clude that BC occurs in a subset of women with NF1 at a young age, and while the absolute risk is low, the relative risks appear high. The risk >50y is not increased. This predisposition does not appear to be a function of the underlying NF1 mutation type or site. This needs to be confirmed in other or larger cohorts, or possibly prospective studies, before recommendations might be made regarding surveillance.

23990,"Breast and Ovarian Cancer (HBOC) is caused by germline mutations mainly in BRCA1 and BRCA2 (BC:5 7%, OC:11 15%), but mutations in low pene trance susceptibility genes have been also demonstrated to account for si gnificant cancer risk. Knowing the underlying molecular defects can be very valuable for diagnosis, guiding treatment and estimating recurrence risks. Here we report the results of panel based NGS screening of 94 genes asso ciated with hereditary cancer predisposition. 850 patients were consecutive tested for BRCA1/BRCA2 and a comprehensive diagnostic HBOC panel in cluding 38 genes. Patients with negative or inconclusive results were further analyzed for the remaining genes. Target enrichment with the Illumina Tru Sight Cancer Panel was followed by paired end sequencing and bioinforma tics data analysis. Diagnostic quality criteria ensured a minimal depth of 30X in at least 98% of the analyzed regions with 99.99% sensitivity and spe cificity in variant calling. For BRCA1/BRCA2 more stringent criteria were required (i.e. 100% coverage at >30X and deletion/duplication analysis).Results show that 8% of the patients have BRCA1/BRCA2 pathogenic mu tations (class 4, 5), 7% were inconclusive (class 3) and 85% were negati ve (class 1, 2). Analysis of the HBOC panel increased the diagnostic yield to 20%. Pathogenic variants were additionally found in ATM, BLM, BRIP1, BUB1B, CHEK2, FANCA, FANCC, FANCD2, NBN, PALB2, RAD51D, RECQL4 and TP53. 41% presented VUS and 39% were negative. Further screening of the remaining cancer predisposition genes revealed pathogenic variants in genes with no confirmed association with HBOC: BAP1, ERCC2, ERCC3 and MUTYH. Some of the genes were identified as causative only once, emphasi zing the advantage of diagnostic panels for HBOC testing.",2015
23991,"Objective: Here, we summarize our experience over the last 2.5 years of HBOC NGS panel testing in a cohort of 364 patients that were referred to our institute for genetic testing. Methods: DNA of all patients was enriched using a custom design panel (Haloplex, Agilent) and sequenced on a MiSeq (Illumina). A median of 1.45 million reads was generated per sample resulting. Further analysis was li mited to a set of 12 core genes. The median overall 20x coverage was 98.01 %. Genes directly requested by the genetic counselor were complemented by MLPA as well as Sanger sequencing for low coverage regions (< 20x). The custom design panel was continuously optimized and a reduction of mis sing bases by a factor of four was possible over time. Results: Adding 10 more genes in diagnostic HBOC testing revealed the ge netic underlying cause in additional 6% of all patients. In total, 19.4 % of our patients carried a mutation within one of the 12 core genes: 7.82 % in BRCA1, 4.85 % in BRCA2, 4.04 % in CHEK2, 1.35 % in ATM, 0.81 % in CDH1 and 0.27 % in NBN. Conclusion: Taken together, we demonstrate that NGS is a fast and cost ef ficient genetic screening tool to analyze for variants in genes associated with the development of hereditary breast cancer However, with an increasing number of genes, correct variant interpretation is challenging and requires extensive genetic expertise. Furthermore, clinical guidelines for the new diagnostic BRCA genes still need to be agreed on.",2015
23992,"Introduction: RAS genes play important roles in the regulatory processes of proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. RAS mutations result in oc currence of protein that induces uncontrolled cell proliferation and inhibit apoptosis. These mutations have been described in various human malig nancies including acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Materials and Methods: We demonstrated NRAS and KRAS mutation in AML patients by pyrosequencing. Twenty samples from AML patients were eva luated for mutation of these genes around the hot spots in codons 12, 13 and 61. Pyrosequencing was performed for detection of KRAS and NRAS mutati on on the Pyromark Q24 system. Results: Three of twenty patients (15%) had NRAS mutations and one of twenty patients (5%) had KRAS mutations. We found NRAS mutation in all of three codons; one case in codons 12, one case in codons 13 and one case in codons61. Both NRAS mutation in codons 12 and codons 13 were resulting in changes from glycine to asparagine (GGT>GAT) whereas NRAS mutation in codons 61 was resulting in changes from glutamine to histidine (CAA>CAT). Only one case that found KRAS mutation in codons 12 was re sulting in changes from glycine to asparagine (GGT>GCT).Conclusion: In this study, pyrosequencing is a powerful tool for detection of and KRAS mutation. The detection rate of NRAS mutation is higher than KRAS mutation in AML patients. However, a large number of AML cases is needed for further studying the molecular mechanisms in the pathogenesis and for prognostic value of the KRAS and NRAS mutations.",2015
23993,"Introduction: Oral cancer is a clinical and molecular heterogeneous malig nancy characterized by low survival and high mortality rates. The biological behavior of this neoplasm varies and tumors with the same clinic pathologi cal features often respond differently to the same treatment. Thus, the iden tification of genetic and epigenetic biomarkers is mandatory to improve dia gnosis, prognosis, early detection of tumors and relapses and ultimately to delineate individualized therapy. Methods: Tumor tissues from 73 patients with oral tumors and gingival samples from 16 healthy donors were used as controls. Methylation Specific Multiplex Ligation dependent Probe Ampli fication (MS MLPA) was conducted to screen copy number alterations and DNA methylation patterns in 54 tumor suppressor genes. Results: From the 54 tumor suppressor genes analyzed those that most frequently exhibited hypermethylation were WT1, MSH6, PAX5 and GATA5. The most frequent copy number alterations were located at chromosomes 3, 9, 11, 12, 16, 17 and 19, highlighting, for example, CTNNB1 and FHIT genes with losses and CDH1, BRCA1, PYCARD, STK11 and CHFR genes with gains. It was possible to find some statistically significant associations among these alterations and the clinic pathological features of the patients, such as metastases and also smoking habits. Conclusion: The combination of genetic and epigenetic studies together with the pathological diagnosis seems to be mandatory not only to early detect these tumors and relapses but also to predict their cli nical behavior. In this way, the increasing knowledge about the genetic and epigenetic mechanisms associated to oral cancer, opens new possibilities at the diagnostic, prognostic and treatment level.",2015

Besides BRCA and MMR genes, several additional con tributing genes have been identified. Multi gene panel testing provides an efficient method for a comprehensive assessment of genes associated with cancer risks. We report our experience of effective multi gene testing in OC patients selected during genetic counselling (GC) for personal and/or family history. Methods: The myRisk panel from Myriad Genetics Laboratories (25 clini cally significant genes) was run in consecutive patients who met one of the following criteria: diagnosis before age 40, multiple primary tumors and/ or at least one first/second degree family member affected by a distinctive cancer of known hereditary cancer syndromes at any age. Results: Twelve out of 20 OC patients who underwent GC from September 30, 2014 to December 31, 2014, met inclusion criteria: 5 of 12 (42%) carry deleterious mutations (2 in BRCA1; 1 each in BRCA2, MSH6 , PMS2 ). Ten vari ants of unknown significance (VUS) (2 in NBN; 1 each in PMS2 , BRCA2, ATM, APC , PTEN, MLH1, P53, BRIP1 ) were identified in eight subjects (8/12; 67%): of these, three also carried a deleterious mutation and one was a suspected somatic mosaicism. Moreover, two deleterious monoallelic MUTYH carriers were detected. Conclusion: The use of multi gene panels including BRCA and MMR genes allows the Ã¢ÂÂone stepÃ¢ÂÂ detection of actionable mutations in a large fraction of OC patients with second primaries and/or family history. The identification of VUS is stimulating from a scientific perspective but should be appropria tely managed during GC.",2015
23995,"Background: Risk reducing bilateral salpingo oophorectomy (RRBSO) in BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation carriers is highly effective in reducing ovarian cancer (OC) risk, by up to 95%. However, reported rates of RRBSO uptake vary widely. We recommend consideration of RRBSO to BRCA1 carriers aged Ã¢ÂÂ¥40yrs and BRCA2 carriers aged Ã¢ÂÂ¥45years. Here we have assessed RRBSO uptake amongst BRCA1 and BRCA2 carriers at Royal Marsden (RM) hospi tal. Methods: We reviewed the electronic patient record for carriers in the RM Genetics unit BRCA carrier register. Our primary endpoint was uptake of RRBSO. Secondary endpoints were rates of occult malignancy at RRBSO and reasons for not undergoing RRBSO. Results: 858 female mutation carriers were identified, of whom 557 met our age criteria (304 BRCA1, 253 BRCA2). 73 women had been diagnosed with OC, leaving 265 BRCA1 and 219 BRCA2 carriers. Of these, 234(88%) BRCA1 carriers and 192(87%) BRCA2 carriers underwent RRBSO. Occult OC was identified in three BRCA1 carriers; two further BRCA1 carriers had intra epithelial neoplasia. Reported reasons for not undergoing RRBSO were per sonal choice (36 women), metastatic breast cancer (12 women) and preser vation of fertility (six women all BRCA1 mutation carriers in early 40s). We do not undertake NHS ovarian surveillance because of unproven efficacy but of those who declined RRBSO, six have private ovarian surveillance. Conclusions: We observed a high rate (87%) of RRBSO uptake amongst BR CA1 and BRCA2 carriers at the Royal Marsden. This work was funded by the RM/ICR NIHR BRC.",2015
23996,"Mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2, main predisposing to breast (BC) and ova rian cancer (OC) genes, were found in less than half of the families suspect for hereditary form of BOC; mutation carriers in either gene constitute only about 25% of the population of high risk patients. Other genes were identified (ATM, CHEK2, NBN, PALB2 etc.), whose mutations can increase the risk of BC in BRCA1 and 2 negative patients. These were described as medium risk genes or genes with moderate penetrance. Mutations in the ATM and NBN genes were recorded with low frequency in Czech populati on, and therefore they can not be recommended for routine clinical testing. In contrast, the analysis of c.1100delC mutation and large exon 9 and 10 deletions in CHEK2 gene were recommended for practice in the CzR; cur rently, missense variants of this gene are subject of focused research. PALB2 gene testing in patients with BOC, but with a normal sequence in BRCA1 and 2 showed that point mutations and major reconstruction of PALB2 (16 in total, 3.9%) can cause the disease in Czech patients (n , 409). Most of these mutations were observed in the subgroup of patients with the inhe rited form of BC here occurrence reaches 5.5% (13/235). Thus, the signi ficance of PALB2 gene mutation analysis in this particular subpopulation is comparable to that of the BRCA2 gene. We believe that the PALB2 should be included in the algorithm of clinical genetic testing in BC patients negative for mutations in the BRCA1 and 2.

Phaeochromocytomas (PCCs) and paragangliomas (PGLs) are rare autono mic nervous system tumours, which typically hypersecrete catecholamines. A notable feature of PCCs/PGLs is the high incidence of inherited cases, such that germline mutations in at least 12 susceptibility genes can be detected in 30 40% of all cases. Recent gene expression profiling studies have shown that a large proportion of inherited cases show activation of the hypoxic gene response pathways. It has also been shown that loss of function muta tions in VHL and SDH subunit genes lead to the stabilisation of the hypoxia inducible factor (HIF) proteins. These HIF proteins are a family of transcrip tion factors (HIF 1, HIF 2 & HIF 3) that bind to and activate multiple genes associated with angiogenesis, glycolysis and cell growth. The stability of the HIF proteins is dependent on two specific proline residues located in the oxygen dependent degradation domain, that are hydroxylated by the oxygen dependent prolyl hydroxylases (PHDs). Once hydroxylated, the HIF proteins can be targeted for proteasomal degradation by the VHL complex. Recently, several groups have reported gain of function mutations in HIF2A/EPAS1 in PCC/PGL cases, which result in the stabilisation of the HIF 2 protein. To date, the majority of the HIF2A mutations have been detected as somatic mutati ons, with little evidence of germline mutations. Here we report the finding of six novel variants, four of which were found present in the germline, and cluster around the secondary hydroxylation site. We also present functional data, which provides further evidence that these variants are pathogenic.",2015

Materials and MethodsA total of 100 patients with PCM were studied. Their age ranged from 28 to 87 years (median and mean , 59) with a male to female ratio of 1.45:1. FISH was performed on CD138 sorted bone marrow samples. ResultsHigh risk genetic changes were found in 46 patients (Table 1). Some pati ents had more than one unfavourable factor. 15 patients had concomitant high risk genetics and hyperdiploidy while 31 patients had high risk ge netics without hyperdiploidy. 22 patients had died of their diseases. 59% (13/22) were in the high risk group with only two having concomitant hy perdiploidy, suggesting that hyperdiploidy might have ameliorating effect. Furthermore, 14 patients were relatively young in age (60 years or below) with five having high risk genetics but without hyperdiploidy. ConclusionsOur results suggested a beneficial effect of concomitant hyperdiploidy in plasma cell myeloma with high risk genetics. This will help identify patients for targeted personalized therapy.

Pro state cancer progression can be inhibited by androgen deprivation thera py but nearly all patients progress to castration resistance prostate cancer (CRPC). There still remains the unsolved question how patients can be best matched with targeted therapies according to characteristics of their tumor genome. Methods: We analyzed a total of 73 plasma samples from 20 CRPC and 9 CSPC (castration sensitive prostate cancer) patients using our previously established plasma Seq approach including low coverage whole genome sequencing to establish copy number profiles and targeted resequencing of prostate cancer associated genes on an Illumina MiSeq platform. Results: Analysis of plasma DNA from prostate cancer patients revealed a variety of copy number changes characteristic for prostate cancer. In a sub set of patients we were able to observe the emergence of AR gene amplifica tion at the time of progression from CSPC to CRPC. AR gene amplifications were found in approximately 70% of CRPC patients. Furthermore, we were able to monitor the evolution of novel focal amplifications and clonal shifts due to therapy changes in one third of the patients. Moreover, plasma DNA analyses reflected the treatment response to second line treatment, i.e. cy totoxic chemotherapy. Conclusions: Our study showed that analyzing plasma DNA offers a non invasive method to monitor patientsÃ¢ÂÂ therapy response and may identify the occurrence of novel changes associated with resistance against a given therapy.

Here we present a case of unilateral testicular lipomatosis in a 23 year old male, referred to clinical genetics services due to the fact that macrocephaly was noted in conjunction. He had previously had two lipomas removed from the neck area at age 5 and examination revealed a lesion consistent with a lipoma on his right foot. No other features of PHTS were noted on examination or in the family history.

Several questions on detection, surveillance and care were defined and ans wered by pubmed literature searches. The guideline describes clinical criteria for PHTS diagnosis and criteria for referral for genetic counselling and/or DNA analysis of the PTEN gene. The following advices for surveillance are given: follow up of development is recommended from diagnosis until 18 years, including control of the thy roid. Adult male and female patients are advised to have surveillance of the thyroid above the age of 18 and of the colon above the age of 40. For female patients, surveillance of the breasts is recommended from age 25 and endo metrial screening from age 30. It is recommended to inform the patients about the benign features of PHTS and the increased risk of cancer, for which information on the exact risks is not reliable. This is because the risks in the cohort studies are probably an overestimation due to bias. Patient information can also be given on paper, websites or social media.

24003,"RAD51 paralogs (RAD51B , RAD51C , RAD51D , XRCC2, XRCC3) have recently been implicated in breast and ovarian cancer predisposition: RAD51C and RAD51D in ovarian cancer, RAD51B and XRCC2 in breast cancer through monoallelic germline deleterious mutations. Previous studies were mostly conducted on family cases selected for high predisposition risk. In addition, XRCC3 polymorphisms have been associated with breast cancer in case con trol studies but no deleterious mutation has been reported. To better estimate the contribution of RAD51 paralogs in breast and ovarian cancer predisposition, these genes were analysed in 2,991 consecutive un related patients diagnosed with breast and/or ovarian cancer and previous ly tested negative for BRCA1/2 mutations. Deleterious truncating mutations were detected in the five RAD51 paralogs: RAD51B (n,4), RAD51C (n,14), RAD51D (n,7), XRCC2 (n,2), and XRCC3 (n,5). The mutation rate was 1.1% (32/2,991 patients). Likely deleterious missense variants were also detec ted in the five RAD51 paralogs at a lower rate: 0.5% (15/2,991 patients). This is the first study of the five RAD51 paralogs conducted on a large series of consecutive unrelated patients, allowing a better evaluation of mutation rate (overall rate: [1.1 1.6%]); not surprisingly, RAD51 paralog mutation rate is lower in this series of unselected patients than previous estimates in patients at high predisposition risk. This is also the first report of XRCC3 truncating mutations in breast and ovarian cancer predisposition.

We have developed a modification of the RRBS method applicable to assess methylation in large collections of DNA samples within biomedical research. Briefly, our modification further reduces the size of the representation to be sequenced simultaneously increasing the inner fraction of CpG islands and shores. By use of this approach we have obtained RRBS data for 80 breast cancer (BC) samples, 6 BC cell lines and 10 samples of normal breast tissue. To date, this is the most comprehensive collection of RRBS data for a set of tumors of the same organ. Cluster analysis of this data distinguishes at least five molecular subtypes of breast tissues (cells) based on the CpG methyla tion. Specific subtypes are assigned to normal breast tissues, BC cell lines, triple negative and HER positive (indistinguishable based on the present dataset), and two independent groups of luminal BC regardless of their HER status. The most pronounced differences of the DNA methylation patterns are observed between normal breast tissues and BC cell lines, the latter pre senting the highest CpG methylation levels within the samples, notwithstan ding different immunoprofiles (LumA, LumB and triple negative). One of the most striking findings is separation of the luminal tumors into two clusters differing by the density of CpG methylation, independently on HER status (LumA or LumB). This separation may reflect differences in the tumor biology between groups and requires further research in terms of utility for prognostication and treatment that may arise from the DNA me thylation markers.

Resveratrol is a natural phytoalexin and induces apoptosis, erythroid diffe rentiation and autophagy in leukemic cells. In this study we aimed to evaluate the cytotoxic, apoptotic and autophagic effect of resveratrol in CML cells by questioning gene expressions which are associated with CML progression. K562 cells were treated with resveratrol time and dose dependent man ner and cytotoxicity was evaluated by using WST 1 assay. The RT qPCR is used for gene expression analysis. Gene expression levels were evaluated by using RT2 Profiler PCR Array. Significant increase was observed in K562 cells treated with resveratrol ac cording to control. The gene expression levels of ATG5 (autophagy related gene), CASP3 (caspase 3) and p27KIP1(Cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor) were increased respectively 10.41, 8.63 and 36 fold via resveratrol. Our findings showed that Resveratrol induced apoptosis and autophagy in K562 cells. Resveratrol upregulated caspase 3 activation in apoptosis and modulation of Atgs in autophagic pathway in K562 cells. Also, resveratrol regulates autophagosome formation via upregulated ATG5 expression. Cdk inhibitor p27KIP1 is a tumor suppressor gene and includes in cell cycle pro cess.

24007,"Introduction: There are several U. S. guidelines for identifying and managing risk for hereditary cancer syndromes. While fundamentally similar, they each differ in details that can lead to differences in assignment of risk levels (Orlando, AJMG, 2014). In order to better understand how these differences in guidelines affect individuals, we describe preliminary results from a na tionally representative population of individuals. Materials and Methods: Eligible participants are patients visiting enrolled primary care clinics at: Duke University, Medical College of Wisconsin, Es sential Rural Healthcare Institute, David Grant Medical Center, or University of North Texas. Enrolled participants enter their personal and family health history information into MeTree, a patient facing risk assessment and clini cal decision support web service. Results: To date 222 participants have completed MeTree. Characteristics include 62% female; 89% white, and mean age 59.6 (range 24 84). The mean no. of relatives entered is 13.3 (range 6 62).

A nominally significant association was found with rs885479, a SNP found in the MC1R gene (p, 0.0157) in the survival analysis. The variant was found to have the same direction of affect as described in the original study and the odds ratio was higher. The presence of one or more copies of the minor allele caused a significant decrease in time to develop skin cancer post re nal transplant (hazard ratio , 2.06). However, none of the variants survived Bonferroni correction for multiple testing. We are now seeking to extend this analysis to additional patient cohorts.

24009,"Treating cancer effectively requires an understanding of the molecular al terations driving each patientÃ¢ÂÂs tumor. Targeted sequencing efforts that characterize prevalent somatic alterations and require limited sample in put may provide an effective diagnostic approach. Herein, we describe the design and characterization of the Oncomine Cancer Research Panel (OCP) that includes recurrent somatic alterations in solid tumors derived from the OncomineÃ¢ÂÂ¢ cancer database. Using Ion AmpliSeqÃ¢ÂÂ¢, we designed a DNA pa nel that includes assays for 73 oncogenes with 1,826 recurrent hotspot mu tations, 26 tumor suppressor genes enriched for deleterious mutations, as well as 75 genes subject to recurrent focal copy gain or loss. A complemen tary RNA panel includes 183 assays for relevant gene fusions involving 22 fusion driver genes. Recommended sample inputs were 10 ng of nucleic acid per pool. Sequencing libraries were analyzed on an Ion Torrent Personal Ge nome Machine. Initial testing revealed an average read depth of > 1,500X with > 95% uniformity and on target frequency. The panel was shown to reliably detect known hotspots, insertions/deletions, gene copy changes, and gene fusions in molecular standards, cell lines and formalin fixed par affin embedded clinical specimens. Retrospective analysis of large clinical cohorts has been completed and the results of analysis of 100 lung cancer and 100 prostate cancer cases will be summarized.

24010,"Background: Five germline genetic variants (rs116909374, rs965513, rs944289, rs966423, rs2439302) have been associated in genome wide as sociation study (GWAS) with increased risk of thyroid cancer, but their role in mortality of patients with thyroid cancer has not been established. Study design: Retrospective study of 1836 patients with differentiated thy roid cancer (1643 women and 193 men) with a median age at diagnosis of 49 years (interquartile range, 38 57years) and an overall median follow up time of 8.7 years (interquartile range, 5 12.5years) after initial treatment at a single comprehensive cancer center between 1990 2013.Results: Among 5 variants, rs966423 was associated with increased morta lity, which was 6.4% (33/518) vs. 3.7% (47/1259) in TT carriers vs. CC/CT carriers (P,0.017). Deaths per 1000 person years were 6.81 vs. 4.01 in TT vs. CC/CT patients (HR,1.6; P,0.038) after adjustment for age at diagnosis, and sex. Importantly, the association of rs966423 with mortality remained significant when lymph node metastasis, extrathyroidal invasion, angioinva sion and distant metastasis were included in the model (HR,1.89; P,0.014). A higher rs966423 associated patient mortality was also observed in seve ral clinicopathological subcategories, e.g. in TT patients with angioinvasion (HR,3.48; P<0.001). Conclusions: rs966423 TT genotype was significantly associated with in creased overall mortality among patients with thyroid cancers. Contrary to BRAF mutation and other somatic changes putatively associated with pati ents mortality, the status of germline rs966423 is known before the treat ment, and might be used in management of mortality risk by means of mo dification of therapy, nevertheless it requires further investigation in large prospective studies before it is ready for clinical application.

Introduction: Recent studies have shown that mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) haplogroups could be associated with cancer development. The present stu dy aimed to analyze mtDNA control region variation of 114 patients with thyroid follicular adenoma (TFA), 121 patients with papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) and 212 healthy controls in order to investigate whether mtDNA ha plogroups contribute to the onset of cancer. Materials and Methods: The two hypervariable segments HVSI and HVSII of the control region were sequenced on ABI3130xl platform for all samples. The unambiguously classified samples were assessed by means of PCR RFLP using a hierarchical system. We performed statistical analysis including PearsonÃ¢ÂÂs chi square test, FisherÃ¢ÂÂs exact test and binary logistic adjusted by age and gender. Results: The haplogroup K appeared underrepresented in TFA and PTC pa tients when compared to healthy controls (p , 0.010; OR , 0.115; 95% CI , 0.015 Ã¢ÂÂ 0.883 and p , 0.010; OR , 0.109; 95% CI , 0.014 Ã¢ÂÂ 0.839, respective ly). The haplogroup HV was associated significantly with increased TFA risk (p , 0.032 OR , 2.697; 95% CI , 1.052 Ã¢ÂÂ 6.910).Conclusions: We found that HV haplogroup may be associated with in creased risk of developing TFA, and K haplogroup can have a protective ef fect for TFA and PTC.

24012,"Introduction: Rs2910164 in mir 146a was among the first polymorphisms described in a microRNA gene. The G C substitution leads to reduction of the amount of miR 146a and to regulation of different set of target genes. The polymorphism was further shown to predispose to papillary thyroid carcinoma (OR,1.62). However, no study analyzed the influence of the SNP on the clinical outcome of thyroid cancer patients. Materials and Methods: The rs2910164 was genotyped using the Sequenom technology in blood derived DNA from 2872 patients treated for differen tiated thyroid cancer (overall median follow up time 8.7 years). Genotyping in thyroid tissue samples was performed using the Taqman assay. The influ ence of miR 146a on the thyroid cancer cell lines was analyzed in K1 cells with induced overexpression or silencing of pre miR 146a. Results: The germinal C allele in rs2910164 was associated with higher mor tality among patients with follicular variant of papillary thyroid carcinoma. Deaths per 1000 person years were 25.64 vs. 4.72 in CC vs. GG/CG patients (HR,5.88; P,0.008). Moreover, a somatic G C mutation in mir 146a was ob served in 6.5% of the analyzed tumor samples. In vitro studies showed that miR 146a significantly increased proliferation of thyroid cancer derived cell line and the presence of the variant C allele resulted in lower proliferation rates, possibly switching the cells towards migration. Conclusions: Rs2910164 in miR 146a predisposes to thyroid carcinoma, causes higher mortality of thyroid cancer patients and undergoes somatic mutations in tumor. G C transition might be responsible for increased meta static potential and aggressiveness of cancer.

Background: The thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH beta) is a heterodime ric glycoprotein which regulates the secretion of the thyroid hormone and therefore thyroid function. In the present study, we evaluated the role of the TSH beta polymorphisms as risk factors for development of differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC).Methods: We first sequenced the TSH beta gene, performed a preliminary association study involving 96 cases versus 96 controls, and then selected four variants for the association studies in a larger population size using Taqman assays. Results: In the preliminary association study, three of the discovered SNPs, rs72695872_C>T [Odds ratio (95% Confidence Interval),1.78(1.07 2.97); p,0.029] and rs1321108_A>G [2.15(1.28 3.62); p,0.004] in the promoter region as well as the intronic rs17477369_T>A [2.50(1.03 6.06); p,0.048] were associated with DTC in a causative fashion. These results were confir med in a larger study involving 507 cases versus 597 controls, at similar or higher significance levels. Also, 4 mer haplotype AGGT (x2,7.36; p,0.0067) and its 3 mer flanking derivatives GGT (x2,11.71; p,0.0054) and AGG (x2,7.45; p,0.0063) conferred significant risk for acquiring thyroid can cer. Another 4 mer haplotype, GAGT (x2,11.21, p,0.0008) and its 3 mer derivative AGT (x2,11.71; p,0.0006) displayed equipotently protective properties against the disease, pointing to changes in the rs1321109_G>A, rs10776792_A>G and rs1321108_A>G as the probable determinants of the se observations.

As a retrospective research study the TruSight cancer panel (Illumina) NGS panel targeting 97 cancer predisposition genes was used to analyze 50 high risk cancer patients with significant personal and family history of cancer without previously identified mutation in BRCA1, BRCA2, TP53, MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, APC or CDKN2A genes. All pathogenic mutations detected by NGS technology have been confirmed by Sanger sequencing. Several deleterious (frameshift, nonsense) mutations were detected in ATM, ERCC2, BAP1, FANCI, PMS2, RECQL4 genes. Several very likely pathogenic missense mutations were detected in the ATM, FANCA, PALB2, BRIP1, MU TYH, PMS2, MEN1 and SDHB. These mutations affect highly conserved do mains and were confirmed to affect protein function by available functional assays, or were confirmed to be pathogenic as a Parent #2 allele in a se rious recessive disease as Ataxia telangiectasia or Fanconi anemia.

24015,"Introduction: Since thymoquinone is isolated from Nigella sativa, its anti oxidant, anti inflammatory and anti cancer effects have been investigated. Thymoquinone causes decrease in cell viability in tumor cells and causes DNA damage and leads to apoptosis in tumor. Especially it has been found that it does not damage healthy cells and this makes it more important as therapeutic substance . In this study, we have proposed to reveal the role of thymoquinone on brain tumor cells by compairing with mitoxantrone and aimed to find more effective and less toxic treatment method. Materials and Methods: YKG1 cell line has been thawed and proliferated. Main stock of thymoquinone was prepared in DMSO solution. Various con centrations of thymoquinone (T1:40 uM, T2:80 uM and T3:160uM ) were prepared from main stock by diluting in DMEM solution. The cells were exposed to thymoquinone with these doses. Additionally the cells were ex posed to 4 different doses of mitoxantrone (M4:0.5ug/ml, M3:0.05ug/ml, M2:0.005ug/ml and M1:0.0005ug/ml). Finally the cells were treated with both of mitoxantrone and thymoquinone series together. Results: Antiproliferative effect of thymoquinone was seen only at T3 doses while both M3 and M4 doses of mitoxantrone showed toxic effect to the cells when they were applied individually. On the other hand, when combined use of mitoxantrone and thymoquinone were done, a significant antitumoral effect was seen in T2M4 combination. Conclusions: The effect of T2M4 combination on the cell suppression was almost twice in M4 mitoxantrone alone application. We thought this result shows synergistic effect of thymoquinone with mitoxantrone.",2015

Uterine leiomyomas (ULM) are the most prevalent pelvic tumors in women and it has been shown that genetic factors contribute to development of ULM. The aim of our study was to analyze SNPs in interleukins IL12RB1, IL12B and IL23R, which play an important role in immune response and to correlate genotypes with clinical data of patients with solitary and multip le leiomyomas. In our study 169 Slovenian ULM patients and 49 controls were included. We found significantly lower frequency of genotype AA for SNP rs11575934 (IL12RB1) in patients with solitary leiomyomas (39,0%, p,0,037) and multiple leiomyomas (45,9%, p,0,036) compared to healthy controls (62,5%). The results suggest that IL12RB1 (rs11575934) AA geno type is protective factor for developing ULM in Slovenian women for both forms of ULM. The analysis of epidemiological factors compared with allele frequency showed significantly higher number of pregnancy (p,0,048) and parity (p,0,004) in women with multiple leiomyomas with A allele for SNP rs11575934 (IL12RB1).

24017,"Aim: Germline mutations in BRCA1 associated protein 1 (BAP1) predispose to uveal melanoma and other cancers. Here, we estimated the frequency of BAP1 germline mutations in Finnish uveal melanoma patients. Methods: We collected genomic DNA from 149 patients treated between 2010 and 2013. In addition, we identified 10 families each with two uveal melanoma patients. We were able to collect DNA from 13 members of uveal melanoma families. All 17 exons of the BAP1 were sequenced in total of 162 patients. Results: We identified two pathogenic heterozygous BAP1 mutations: a donor splice site mutation in a highly conserved region in intron 2 in a spo radic patient and a frameshift insertion in exon 14 in three familial patients. The frequency for sporadic mutation is 0,67% (1/149, 95%CI <0,0001 to 0,04). Including the three familial mutation carriers to calculations, the fre quency of BAP1 mutations is 2,5% (4/159, 95%CI <0,0076 to 0,0651). The insertion was found in two, possibly distantly related, families. The muta tions were not present in ExAC database including 3325 Finnish controls from the SISu project. Conclusions: BAP1 mutations predispose to uveal melanoma also in Finland. Mutations explained uveal melanoma in one sporadic patient and in two fa milies of ten.

24018,"A vestibular schwannoma (VS) (acoustic Neurinoma) is a benign tumors ori ginated from Schwann cells (SC) of the vestibular nerve and located in the cerebello pontine angle or the inner auditory canal. The tumor results from an overproliferation of SC; these cells wrap themselves around nerve fibres, often causing gradual hearing loss, tinnitus and dizziness. It can also affect with the facial nerve causing paralysis by compression. Early detection of the tumour is sometimes difficult, because the symptoms may be subtle and may not appear in the beginning. There are two types of VS: Bilateral and unilateral. Until now there is only one single gene known for bilateral VS, that leads to neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2). Unilateral VS account for ap proximately 8 % of all cranial tumours. The exact cause of unilateral VS is unknown, most occur spontaneously. Our study group consists of 144 pati ents (from 139 independent families) of which 23 have a bilateral VS (NF2), 119 unilateral VS and 2 with an initial suspicion of VS. All patients were clinically clearly defined. Genetically we performed a mutation analysis on the NF2 gene at the genomic and tumor level. So far we identified different missense/nonsense and splice mutations in NF2 gene, on the genomic le vel and in some cases exclusively in tumor cells, which all lead to a loss of function of the gene product Merlin and the appearance of VS.

Methods and Results: Here, we described a 16 year old female patient with mild fa cial dysmorphic features, intellectual disability (ID) and marfanoid habitus (MH). CytoScan HD array analyses identified a 1q32.1 interstitial microde letion of 1.87 Mb (hg19:200,852,854 202,726,877).

24023,"Array CGH analysis has improved the detection of pathogenic imbalances in patients with intellectual disability and congenital malformations and de monstrated that copy number variations (CNVs) are a major source of gene tic diversity between normal individuals. Recurrent CNVs are usually caused by non allelic homologous recombination (NAHR) between LCRs, while se veral microhomology mediated repair mechanisms including Non Homolo gous End Joining (NHEJ) and Fork Stalling and Template Switching (FoSTeS) have been proposed to explain the etiology of non recurrent CNVs. In this study we evaluated the frequency of CNVs in a cohort of 1051 pati ents referred to our institution because of intellectual disability, develop mental delay, autism or multiple congenital anomalies. CNVs breakpoints were analyzed to identify sequence microhomologies that may have medi ated the rearrangement. We also assessed whether the mechanism of for mation or the CNV pathogenicity were associated with the inheritance (de novo or inherited anomaly), the type (deletion or duplication) or the size of the imbalance. Array CGH analysis detected at least one pathogenic or likely pathogenic CNV in 15.8% of patients and the anomalies were more likely deletions and CNVs arisen de novo. Most of the imbalances were caused by microhomolo gy mediated mechanisms (74.2%) but no significant differences were ob served with regard to the type of CNV or the pattern of inheritance.

Azoospermia is defined as the absence of live spermatozoa in se men, and may be obstructive or nonobstructive depending on the presence of blockage of the tubules or ducts. Chromosomal rearrangements are a recognized cause of reproductive failure in males, with a significantly hig her rate of cytogenetic anomalies observed in azoospermic (13.7%) than in oligospermic men (4.6%). In addition, Y chromosome microdeletion is a major genetic cause, specifically involving azoospermia factor regions (AZF). However, duplications involving AZF at Yq have been described both in infertile and fertile men. Here we report the case of an azoospermic man with a reciprocal autosomal balanced translocation and Yq duplication. Ka ryotype in blood lymphocytes was 46,XY, t(6;13)(p12;p13) and array ge nomic hybridization was performed to search for copy number alteration at breakpoints.

As the role of increased expression of some genes inside the duplicated AZF region is controversial and Yq du plication is inherited from his normal father, can be hypothesized that the translocation led to meiotic impairment or (and) disruption of an autosomal gene involved in gametogenesis.

Subsequently he had an abnormal sweat chloride test and full gene analysis for sequence variants and gene rearrangements of the CFTR gene was initiated. By MLPA he was found to carry a deletion of exons 17 20. Analysis by quantitative real time PCR could only confirm the pre sence of a deletion of exons 18 20. Sequencing of the deletion breakpoint revealed a complex rearrangement that confirmed the loss of exons 18 20, but also found inserted at the breakpoint junction an inverted portion of intron 18 (119 bp) joined to a GA dinucleotide and then an inverted portion of exon 17 (66bp) (CFTRc.2908+353_c.3368 1088delins(c.2988+1022_c.2988+1141inv:GA:c.2717_c.2782inv)). The abnormal MLPA result for exon 17 is hypothesized to be due to the duplicated portion of exon 17 acting as a Ã¢ÂÂsinkÃ¢ÂÂ, binding the MLPA probe whilst not permitting amplification. Microhomologies (2 8bp) and short repetitive elements at or near the breakpoints, the size of the rear ranged sequences, and their proximity to one another suggest that a repli cative based mechanism such as fork stalling and template switching may underlie this rearrangement. To our knowledge this represents the most complex CFTR rearrangement reported in the literature.",2015
24026,"In recent years there have been a number of reports of chromothripsis like events in patients with developmental delay and congenital abnormalities. Chromothripsis is believed to involve an initial trigger which causes chromo some shattering and repair by non homologous end joining (NHEJ). Howe ver, the vast majority of reported cases of constitutional chromothripsis have copy number profiles that more closely resemble a replication based event distinct to chromothripsis called chromoanasynthesis (Liu et al., 2011). The key difference between the two processes is that whilst chromothripsis is characterised by loss and retention of heterozygosity, chromoanasynthesis ABSTRACTS POSTERS ESHG 2015 | GLASGOW, SCOTLAND, UK | WWW.

We report three patients, two male and one female, each with a developmental disor der, who were referred for array CGH analysis. They were all shown to have multiple duplications on the X chromosome. This has resulted in the partial duplication of the MECP2 gene in one patient and the partial duplication of the CDKL5 gene in another. The presence of multiple copy number gains clustered on a single chromosome is consistent with chromoanasynthesis. No similar complex rearrangements involving an autosome chromosome have been detected in our laboratory. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first patients reported with multiple copy number gains on the X chromosome.",2015
24027,"Biallelic PMS2 mutations are responsible for more than half of all cases of constitutive mismatch repair deficiency (CMMRD), a recessively inherited childhood cancer predisposition syndrome. The 3Ã¢ÂÂ region (exons 9 15) of the PMS2 gene is located in a 100 kb sequence that is duplicated ~0.7 Mb centromeric in inverse orientation on 7p22.1. Sequence exchange, prima rily homologous recombination (HR) with crossover between the 100 kb duplicons, is thought to be responsible for the known genomic inversion polymorphism of the 0.7 Mb sequence intervening the duplicons. PMS2 transcript and MLPA analysis in a new CMMRD patient rendered results that were best explained by a genomic rearrangement separating the N terminal from the C terminal region of the gene. GenomeWalker analysis and 3Ã¢ÂÂRACE PCR uncovered the breakpoints of a complex rearrangement that is charac terized by a ~918 kb inversion that exceeds the known inversion polymor phism by ~220 kb. This inversion was further associated with a duplication of ~100 kb of the inverted region. Fork stalling and template switching/microhomology mediated break induced replication (FoSTeS/MMBIR) is the most parsimonious mechanism by which the rearrangement truncating the PMS2 gene could be explained. These findings support the hypothesis that inverted segmental duplications can not only mediate the formation of simple inversions by HR but also more complex structural rearrangements. It further suggests that complex rearrangements with copy number alterati ons could be hidden among the genomic inversion on 7p22.1.",2015

Thirty percent of the cataracts are heredity with the nonsyndromic autosomal dominant form. About 30 loci have been associated to congenital cataract. CRYBB2 gene belongs to ÃÂ² crystallin family together with 6 genes (4 CRYBA and 2 CRYBB) on several chromosomes and is related to congeni tal cataract. In the present study, we analyzed a Mexican family affected by autosomal dominant pulverulent cataract in four generations through who le exome and identified the cC475T (pQ155X) mutation on CRYBB2. Non sense cC475T (pQ155X) mutation has been reported previously from five different countries and predicts a stop codon on Q155 losing 51 aminoacids and four Greek key domain in the C terminal region of the CRYBB2 protein. Gene conversion seems to be the cause of this type of cataract cataracts. This is the first Mexican family with pulverulent cataract associated to a pQ155X mutation.

The CFTR gene is characterized by an extremely large number of mutations (more than 1900). To date, after the routine genetic testing including the analysis of the most frequent mutati ons of CFTR gene about 30% of mutations remain unidentified. We studied CFTR gene in cohort of 50 CF patients with one or both unknown mutations. We performed sequencing to characterize the mutations in coding regions, promoter and splice sites in CFTR gene. To exclude large gene deletions/insertions the method of MLPA was used. 71% of patients including in this study have classical form of CF and 29% atypical mild form of disease. We identified 5 rare mutations with quite high frequency in Russian populati on (3849+10kbC/T , E92K, 489+1G>T , Ser1231ProfsX4, L1335P) that arenÃ¢ÂÂt included in panel of mutations for routine CF testing in Russia.

In our study mutations of CFTR gene were found in 85,6% of CF chromosomes. Among patients with classical form mu tations were identified in 94% of CF chromosomes whereas among patients with atypical form only in 61%.

DDR response was monitored by detecting ÃÂ³H2AX, p53, Rad51, p21waf1 and BRCA1 proteins in two time points following irradiation, by immunofluorescence and western blot. The respective mRNA levels were also studied. Characteristic foci of phosphorylated ÃÂ³H2AX, a marker of ds DNA damage, were clearly detected in HEK293 cell nuclei, in just half an hour after irra diation. In accordance, altered protein levels of key molecules involved in DNA repair such as BRCA1 and Rad51, were also observed. More specifi cally, BRCA1 protein was significantly induced in at least half an hour after irradiation, while Rad51 protein levels were higher than normal 48hours following irradiation. No significant modification was observed in p53 and p21 waf1 protein levels. In conclusion, DCBCT irradiation of HEK293 cells results in at least tempora ry modification of molecules involved in DNA damage detection and repair.

24033,"Glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor deficiencies represent a pheno typically highly variable and diverse new class of congenital disorders of gly cosylation. Over the recent years pathogenic mutations have been identified in 12 genes of the GPI anchor synthesis and maturation pathway. There are certain features that are shared by most patients with a GPI anchor defi ciency such as intellectual disability or epilepsies. However, other features such as a characteristic facial gestalt, certain organ malformations or abnor malities in routine laboratory parameters, allow the delineation of distinct syndromes (Mabry syndrome, CHIME syndrome, MCAHS1 3).With more than 300 known GPI anchored proteins (GPI AP), we hypothe sized that the differences in the phenotypic landscape of GPI anchor defi ciencies might also be due to mutation specific changes in GPI AP expres sion. We established a comprehensive flow cytometric protocol comprising 10 different GPI anchored markers for different types of cell culture. We screened a cohort of 20 patients with pathogenic mutations in 5 different genes of the GPI anchor synthesis and maturation pathway. We found characteristic flow cytometric expression patterns for GPI ancho red markers for each analyzed gene. So far it has been assumed that any impairment of GPI anchor synthesis would affect all GPI APs uniformly. Thus our results are an unexpected finding and suggest that there might be a correlation between certain phenotypic features and the absence of cer tain GPI APs.",2015
24034,"of Molecular Bases of Human Genetics, Moscow, Russian Federation. Sphingomyelin synthase 1 (SMS1) catalyses the synthesis of sphingomye lin and diacylglycerol from phosphatidylcholine and ceramide in eukaryotic cells. Sphingomyelin forms membrane rafts, which are important in mem brane sorting and transport of proteins and in receptor signalling. The con sumption and production of important regulators of cell processes such as ceramide and diacylglycerol, respectively, link SMS1 function to the proces ses of membrane transport, cell proliferation and apoptosis. We have pre viously determined the structure of the SGMS1 gene encoding this enzyme and a number of its alternative transcripts. Here, we present a study of the expression of the full length SMS1 protein and the sum of the alternative transcripts encoding this protein in human tissues. Abundance of SMS1 pro tein was detected using immunodetection. SMS1 abundance was normalized to the total protein amount. Abundance of SGMS1 gene coding transcripts was detected using real time PCR. The amounts of the transcripts of SGMS1 gene were estimated relative to the average mRNA level of housekeeping genes (LDHÃÂ, GAPDH and RPL3). The highest SMS1 protein expression level was detected in the kidney; low levels were observed in the placenta and the lymph node. Transcripts encoding the full length SMS1 were most abundant in the placenta, minimal level were observed in liver. Thus, the SMS1 protein and mRNA levels in tissues differed significantly and were not correlated. Computer sequence analysis of the SGMS1 gene mRNA has revealed many binding sites of miRNA associated with Argonaute proteins in coding regi on and 3Ã¢ÂÂUTR.

We performed a comprehensive survey of transcriptional landscape in three potentially viable human trisomies (T21, T18, T13) to investigate whether global gene expression profile of these tri somies reflects a common homeostatic genome response or represents a specific gene dosage effect of the underlying trisomy. Transcriptomic analyses, comparing global gene expression profile between trisomic and normal cell line, using AgilentÃ¢ÂÂs Whole Human Genome Expres sion arrays, were performed in three groups: first and second comprised of the cultivated amniocytes with T21 and T18 (10 and 9 samples), while the third consisted of the cultivated cells of T13 chorionic villi (11 samples). For each group, a comparable number of tissue matched normal cell line samp les were used for comparison against reference expression profile. Comparative analysis of differentially expressed genes in T21, T18 and T13 precipitated a subset of genes, differentially expressed in all three trisomies: WBP4 and PRPF8, involved in the mRNA splicing and PPID involved in pro tein folding. In addition, a co expression network analyses demonstrated modular deregulation of gene clusters involved in cell division, RNA pro cessing and transcriptional factors shared between T18 and T21, but not with T13. Our data confirm that common trisomies induce transcriptome deregula tion already in prenatal period. Moreover, we suggest that transcriptional alternations related to common trisomies reflect a genomic response asso ciated with deregulation of genes involved in the cell cycle control, mRNA processing and important cellular signaling pathways. Further studies are needed to address the question of common homeostatic genomic response in common human trisomies.",2015

One concern related to the use of reprogrammed somatic cells is the loss of genomic integrity and chro mosome stability, a hallmark for cancer and many other human disorders.

At early passages we detected cytogenetic rear rangements in 44% (7/16) of iPSC lines generated by lentiviral integration whereas the corresponding figure was 6% (1/16) using SeV based delivery.

24037,"As array comparative genomic hybridization (a CGH) and high throughput sequencing (exome) technologies have swiftly spread throughout the medi cal field, karyotype has gradually lost its leading role among genetic tests. For example, in case of a child with intellectual disability (ID), without any specific sign leading to a precise clinical diagnosis, several international gui delines recommend to start with a CGH screening then go on with exome analysis. Generalized use of whole genome sequencing increases etiologic diagnoses rate up to 30% in case of ID. These technologies are definitely major steps in the etiological process of ID. However, physicians have to deal with the lack of qualitative information of the genome. Especially, exome and a CGH analysis fail to reveal chromoso mal rearrangements because breakpoints are either located in introns or not associated with a gain or lost of genetic material. If theses quantitative technologies cannot easily identify chromosomal translocations or inversi ons which sometimes split a gene in two, karyotype does. Here, we show 3 cases whose karyotype swiftly provided us the right dia gnosis for a monogenic disease while gene molecular analysis had remained unsuccessful. When clinical diagnosis of a monogenic disease is suggested, the molecular analysis of the targeted gene may sometimes fail to identify the causal mutation. Then it could be very useful to carry out a karyotype in order to reveal a chromosomal rearrangement involving the targeted gene. If this gene is split in two confirmed by FISH, then the physician is not only able to confirm the causing disease but also to give the appropriate genetic counselling.",2015

In our cohort of 43 BCRs (28 translocations, 10 inversions, five complex rearrangements), 180K aCGH revealed 32 likely pathogenic imbalances (2.2kb 6.6Mb) on re arranged chromosomes in 12 BCRs. Breakpoint mapping by MPS were per formed in 27/43 BCRs. MPS expanded the number of breakpoints detected by karyotyping or aCGH from 114 to 162 (resolution <2kb). The 48 additio nal breakpoints were found in nine BCRs. The number of breakpoints/BCR ranged from 2 22; the five most complex BCRs (10 22 breaks) displayed hallmarks of chromothripsis. Gene disruption was observed in 25/27 BCRs: 10 BCRs disrupted known diseases genes or their regulatory region, and five others disrupted candidate genes. Overall pathogenic imbalances on rear ranged chromosomes and/or disrupted known disease genes/regulatory regions were identified in 19/44 BCRs, proving the effectiveness of aCGH/MPS for genotype phenotype correlations.

Micro homology of 2 7 nucleotides were detected in 11/30 breakpoints junctions; one breakpoint junction had a 30 nucleotide homology.

We identified a novel heterozygous mutation in ACTA1, c.448A>G (p.

Although the function of miR 96 5p in the inner ear has been highly investigated, the biological role of its partner strand still remains unclear. Methods and Results. We analyzed the expression pattern of both miR 96 3p and 5p in the developing mouse embryo (from 10.5 days post coitum to the end of gestation), using specific LNA probes for in situ detection. Alt hough both mature miRNAs were co expressed in several tissues (neural tube, somites, and developing ear) a different spatio temporal distribution between the 3p and 5p was found. To understand which factors may in fluence miRNA strand selection, we are currently combining miRNA in situ hybridization and immunohistochemical staining for proteins involved eit her in miRNA biogenesis or in RNA interference (e.g. Ago1 4, TRBP).

The majority of these deletions span 1.4 Mb (type 1 NF1 deletions) and are characterized by breakpoints located within low copy repeats termed NF1 REPa and NF1 REPc. Previous studies have suggested that most type 1 NF1 deletion breakpoints cluster within hotspots of nonallelic homologous recombination (NAHR) termed PRS1 and PRS2, but a methodical analysis of breakpoint position in a large number of type 1 NF1 deletions has not so far been performed. The aim of our present study is to determine the precise breakpoint positions in 67 patients with type 1 NF1 deletions initially identified by MLPA in order to identify their breakpoints (sites of strand exchange) at the highest possible resolution. To do so, we performed SNP genotyping of paralog specific PCR products as well sequence analysis of breakpoint spanning PCR products.

Cytogenetic anomalies are rare in both syndromes and represent less than 3% of SRS or BWS. Large duplications encompassing the two imprinting centers have already been described as associated with SRS or BWS, de pending on the parental origin of the duplication.

24047,"Introduction: SNP array allows the integration of genotype and copy num ber information, which permits the simultaneous detection of (low level mosaic) copy number variations, consanguinity and UPD in cases of isodi somy. We report on a case where a mosaic pattern was missed by SNP array due to the absence of heterozygosity in the normal cells. Case presentation: Array analysis of non consanguineous parents was per formed because the array result of their child showed a terminal deletion of at least 4.3 Mb in 6q27 (chr6: 166,863,544 qter). An Illumina Omni Express 850K was used for the trio analysis and the mother showed the same deleti on. While the mother is healthy, the child presented with moderate develop mental delay, autism and delay of motor skills. Distal 6q deletions have been described in literature and the patientsÃ¢ÂÂ main characteristics are intellectual disability, hypotonia, seizures, brain anomalies and specific dysmorphic fea tures. At least part of the clinical features of the child can be explained by this deletion. Because the mother has no phenotypic features we considered a mosaic pattern for the deletion. Therefore we performed FISH resulting in detection of the deletion in 49 of the 100 analyzed metaphases indicating that the mother is indeed a mosaic carrier for the deletion. Conclusion: The reason we missed the mosaic pattern and only detected the deletion must have been caused by the absence of heterozygosity of the critical region. Therefore, we recommend FISH analysis in case a healthy carrier has a deletion to detect a possible mosaic pattern.",2015
24048,"The long (2.2Mb) human dystrophin transcript (DMD) takes 16 hours to be transcribed and is co transcriptional spliced. The presence of long introns (24 over 10kb long, 5 over 100kb long) poses challenges to the splicing ma chinery. Additionally, the heterogeneity in intron size suggests that intron removal not always takes place consecutively. Here, we explored the order of intron removal and potential multi step splicing for the DMD transcripts in human skeletal muscle cell lines. A customized library of probes covering all exons and introns, has been generated capturing pre mRNA and tar geting DMD, followed by Hiseq sequencing. We developed a new pipeline (SplicePie) to analyze capture pre mRNA sequencing data. Analysis showed that DMD introns can be removed non sequentially generating exon blocks joined blocks of exons flanked by unspliced introns. Exon blocks were de tected by analysis of the coverage of paired end reads and validated experi mentally using PCR and Sanger sequencing. No correlation between intron length and speed of intron removal was observed. Computational analysis and experimental validation revealed that intron removal takes place in se veral steps for the majority of dystrophin introns. We found two mechanis ms of multi step intron removal in DMD recursive and nested splicing. Non sequential and multi step splicing events were found throughout the DMD gene across three cell lines. We believe that our findings of non sequential and multi step splicing provide insight in the splicing mechanism and will be useful to optimize therapeutic strategies that interfere with the splicing process.",2015

The origins of somatic genome variations manifesting as structural chro mosomal rearrangements remain largely unknown. However, it is generally accepted that susceptibility to structural chromosome aberrations can be produced by alterations to DNA sequences flanking the breakpoints or to rearranged chromosomal regions (i.e. CNV). Addressing genome variations in children with intellectual disability, autism, epilepsy and/or congenital malformations (n,200) by high resolution CNV analysis (molecular karyo typing; resolution: 1 kbp or higher), we have surprisingly found that somatic structural chromosome abnormalities can co occur with non mosaic ones within the same loci. More precisely, we detected 8 cases (4%) (4 dupli cations and 4 deletions) demonstrating small non mosaic structural chro mosome rearrangements encompassed by larger mosaic ones. The dupli cations were mosaic dup3p26.3p26.1 (5.8 Mb) vs. regular dup3p26.1 (2.9 Mb); mosaic dup14q32.13q32.2 (4.5 Mb) vs. regular dup14q32.2 (1.8 Mb); mosaic dup17p13.1p11.2 (6.9 Mb) vs. regular dup17p12 (1.4 Mb); mosaic dup18p11.32p11.31 (5.3 Mb) vs. regular dup18p11.32p11.31 (4.8 Mb). The deletions were mosaic del5q35.1q35.3 (9.2 Mb) vs. regular del5q35.2q35.3 (2.3 Mb); mosaic del14q11.2 (2.2 Mb) vs. regular del14q11.2 (0.5 Mb); mo saic del15q13.1q14 (8.2 Mb) vs. regular del15q13.2q13.3 (2 Mb); mosaic delXp22.32p22.2 (4.7 Mb) vs. regular delXp22.31 (0.7 Mb).

TL is therefore regarded as a marker of cellular age and has been proposed as a marker of biological ageing. Shorter mean leukocyte TL has been shown to be associated with several age related diseases. GWA studies have identified seven loci that associate with telomere length in humans. Of these loci, five contain genes with known roles in telomere biology (TERC, TERT , NAF1, OBFC1, RTEL1) but the remaining two do not, therefore poten tially identifying novel genes involved in telomere length determination in humans.

In this study, the entire 8q24 break point region has been resolved by next generation sequencing. Eight poly morphic alleles were identified and compared with the junction sequences of previous and two recently identified t(8;22) cases . All of the breakpoints were found to be within the PATRRs on chromosomes 8 and 22 (PATRR8 and PATRR22), but the locations were different among cases at the level of nucleotide resolution. The translocations were always found to arise on symmetric PATRR8 alleles with breakpoints at the center of symmetry. The translocation junction is often accompanied by symmetric deletions at the center of both PATRRs. Rejoining occurs with minimal homology between the translocation partners. Remarkably, comparison of der(8) to der(22) sequences shows identical breakpoint junctions between them, which like ly represent products of two independent events on the basis of a classical model.

Introduction: Autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease is characteri zed by cysts development in the collecting ducts often associated with hepa tic involvement and it is caused by mutations in PKHD1 gene. Due to the lar ge size of this gene the conventional mutation screening is time consuming and expensive, so that a molecular diagnosis is often missed. Materials and Methods: A NGS method for screening of PKHD1 gene based on Ion Torrent platform was developed and validated in this study. 26 sub jects were submitted to our NGS protocol, 14 with known mutations in PK HD1 gene and 12 without a molecular characterization. Results: Our NGS method allowed to detect all the mutations previously identified by conventional sequencing. Additional mutations were also iden tified, providing more information about the carrier status or completing the molecular characterization in probands. All additional or newly detected variants were confirmed by Sanger sequencing. Our NGS approach allowed to identify the mutations also in all the not yet tested subjects. During our analysis 17 previously undescribed variants were detected, contributing to extend the spectrum of known mutations in PKHD1 gene. Conclusions: This method resulted accurate, robust and more sensitive than the conventional sequencing, with a considerable reduction of work times and costs. Although it will be necessary to test more patients, our study is a proof of concept showing the feasibility of our NGS protocol for diagnostic purpose, improving and accelerating molecular diagnosis and genetic coun seling for families.",2015

We have revisited 250 cases with intellectual disability and/or Autism spectrum disorders, analyzed by oligonucleotide array CGH (Agilent 4x180K platform) from 2011 and 2012 in order to evaluate if the observed CNVs would be reclassified according to the update of databases.

24058,"Background: The clinical phenotype of patients with beta hemoglobinopa thies is extremely heterogenous, ranging from nearly asymptomatic forms of thalassemia intermedia to severe transfusion dependent thalassemia major. The wide phenotypical variability is associated with the type of beta globin mutation, the coinheritance of alpha thalassemia and the ability for persistent production of fetal haemoglobin (HbF) in adult life. Three major quantitative trait loci, accounting for 20 50% of HbF variation, have been identified by now. Single nucleotide polymorphisms in the gamma globin gene promoter (HBG2), in the BCL11A gene and HBS1L MYB intergenic re gion contribute to the calculation of the Thalassemia Severity Score (TSS), a free web based tool (http://tss.unica.it/home/#.VNNSCS7CT2c ) for the prediction of clinical severity. Methods: We developed a teststrip based reverse hybridisation assay for the simultaneous detection of polymorphisms in quantitative HbF loci: XmnI (g. 158 C>T , rs7482144) in HBG2, rs1427407 and rs10189857 in BCL11A , and rs28384513 and rs9399137 in the HBS1L MYB region. A total of 75 pre typed samples were retested in three different French thalassemia centers for assay validation. Results: StripAssay results were 100% concordant with genotypes pre viously obtained by reference methods in the three participating labora tories. The Beta Thal Modifier StripAssay quickly and correctly identifies disease modifying alleles and thus supports the use of TSS for the prediction of patients likely to display less severe phenotypes. Conclusions: Testing for genetic modifiers allows a more specific and effec tive treatment and may also support clinical decisions regarding the onset of transfusion therapy in beta thalassemia patients.

Today sequencing costs of tar geted NGS based sequencing strategies are largely determined by enrich ment procedures. Molecular inversion probes (MIPs) have shown to be a cost effective enrichment used in multiplex, particularly if used in large cohorts. Here we present a workflow of re sequencing BRCA1 and BRCA2 using single molecule molecular inversion probes (smMIP) in combination with NexSeq500 sequencing. The strategy involves the analysis of all coding exons and their flanking intronic sequences. We designed 402 overlapping smMIPs on both strands avoiding known SNPs in probe binding sites. Every base was targeted by at least two independent smMIPs. This yielded 100% coverage of all targeted bases.

The gene list is fully customisable; therefore the panel is ideally suited for patients with complex personal and/or family histories of cancer. Samples are tested using Agilent SureSelect chemistry and Illumina sequen cing. To date, we have tested over 250 patients, achieving 100% coverage at 50x and a diagnostic yield (likely pathogenic and pathogenic variants) of 12%. As clinicians typically opt for a relatively small phenotype focused subset of genes, the discovery of variants of uncertain clinical significance is minimised (13% reports). In the event of a negative result, additional genes may be analysed if appropriate without the need to perform further labo ratory work. A recent major development in our service is the adaptation of the NGS pipe line for the detection of large duplications and deletions using comparati ve depth of coverage analysis. Validation studies confirmed 325 individual gene results, including 38 dosage abnormalities. This method enables com prehensive dosage analysis on a larger scale and at a lower cost compared to using a stand alone method e.g. MLPA.

The carrier frequency is estimated approximately at 3 4% of general population with an incidence of about 1 in 2500 3500 live births. The frequency and distributi on of mutations show clear ethnic and geographical distribution and Greece, due to its geographic position, presents high mutational heterogeneity. Materials and methods: The extended screening protocol included scree ning of the whole coding sequence, intron exon boundaries, as well as scree ning for abnormal copy numbers (deletions and duplications) using MLPAÃÂ® (SALSA MLPA P091 CFTR probemix). Screening was performed by High Re solution Melting Analysis (HRM) using LightScannerÃÂ® (Idaho Technologies, Utah, USA) and all positive findings were confirmed by bi directional Sanger ABSTRACTS POSTERS ESHG 2015 | GLASGOW, SCOTLAND, UK | WWW. ESHG. ORG 279Back to inde x sequencing. Results: This approach was applied to 94 patients selected due to having one or both undetermined causative mutations and we were able to identify both causative mutations in 59 of them. The protocol was also applied to 2300 individuals from risk groups (partners of CF carriers/patients, couples presenting with echogenic bowel at the second trimester of pregnancy, ma les with CBAVD) and 50 carriers were identified, that with other screening protocols would have been missed. Conclusions: The extended protocol described herein proves to be neces sary when screening an extremely heterogeneous population such as the Greek population. The necessity for identifying both causative mutations in a patient is especially important nowadays that innovative therapeutic agents available aim at specific genotypes.",2015
24067,"Clinical exome sequencing (CES) can provide a molecular diagnosis in fami lies with an unexplained phenotype. When using this technique in a diagno stic setting it is important to follow a well documented diagnostic routing. Here we present an effective routing and the results of the first 129 families. Furthermore, we compare the diagnostic yield of our exome pipeline with the yield of Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS).In a multidisciplinary team, candidate families are discussed and selected. The diagnostic routing prior to WES is defined: exclusion of other genes in differential diagnosis and deletions/duplications (array), revealing the regi ons of homozygosity (SNP array), and determination of the primary filtering strategy according to the expected inheritance model. Prioritization of va riants is performed with Cartagenia Bench Lab NGS using validated variant filtering trees (de novo, recessive, X linked, multiple affected AD/AR).The diagnostic WES procedure was evaluated for the first 129 families. A conclusive diagnosis was made in 36/129 patients (28%), including intel lectual disability (ID, n,90, yield 24%) and phenotypes without ID (n,39, yield 39%). Nine incidental findings were detected, two clinical diagnoses and seven carrierships. Furthermore, we performed an in silico analysis of how well our strategy would have performed compared to WGS, by determining the number of mutations that we would have missed based on a large WGS study (Gilissen, Nature 2014). Our strategy would have identified 17/21 mutations, at much lower costs. In conclusion, we have implemented an efficient strategy for CES. The dia gnostic yield is high (28%), and this yield is close to that of WGS.",2015

We outline the timeline and processes involved in achieving this, including the pathway to achieving accreditation to ISO 15189 standards. TGLclinical is now delivering testing for cancer predisposition genes to the Royal Marsden Hospital using next generation sequencing with the Illumi na TruSight Cancer Panel. This has increased throughput at greatly reduced costs and turn around times. TGLclinical interpretation services are fully integrated with local clinical and research expertise and provide a standard of clinical interpretation that can be used effectively by both oncology clini cians during the routine care of patients with cancer and by genetic clini cians in standard genetic services. The establishment of TGLclinical has enabled significant changes and im provements over the past 3 years to the genetic services available at the Royal Marsden Hospital. For BRCA1 and BRCA2 gene tests as an example, the charge per test has reduced by ~75%, the number of patients being te sted has increased 3.5 fold and the average turn around time for results has reduced from 8 weeks to less than 4 weeks.

24069,"The Deciphering Developmental Disorders (DDD) is a project at the Wellco me Trust Sanger Institute focussing on identifying rare genetic variants in a cohort of approximately 12,000 patients with undiagnosed developmental disorders. Next Generation Exome sequencing and array comparative geno mic hybridization (aCGH) are used to scan patient genomes for a wide range of genomic variation, including copy number variation (CNV). Here we introduce a pipeline to perform CNV detection on large numbers of Next Generation Exome Sequencing datasets. Within this pipeline the follo wing detection algorithms have been implemented: ADM3, CANOES, CoNI FER, CoNVex, ExomeDepth, GADA and XHMM. A new method has been deve loped for the combining and ranking of CNV detections, called: split segment ranking. This is a dynamic ranking system that converts confidence scores from existing algorithms into a new comparable ranked score. We show that by combining the CNV detections of multiple algorithms we can improve call specificity, while retaining a solid number of detections. Using 500 samples from the DDD project we assessed the CNV calling ra tes across all algorithms in terms of sensitivity and specificity. By using the proportion of common CNV detections made as an estimate for specifici ty we show that by using multiple algorithms we achieved a common CNV detection rate of approximately 90% which is in line with previous studies into rare CNV. However, by implementing the split segment ranking method we can potentially achieve a similar specificity while retaining more CNV detections overall.",2015

This includes demonstrating individual pro ficiency of staff authorising genetic test results. Laboratories often find it difficult to assess and provide evidence of the expertise of the process of report authorisation. Due to participant demand the UK National External Quality Assessment Service (UK NEQAS) for Molecular Genetics delivered a pilot external quality assessment (EQA) during 2014 to assess if EQA could help evidence this competency. Twenty eight genetic laboratories participated in this pilot run and were supplied with three clinical case scenarios for patients referred for cystic fibrosis molecular testing. Details of the test performed, the genotyping results obtained and the draft report were supplied and participants were required to review the reports according to the referral information and re sults provided, and state whether or not each report should be authorised. If the report was deemed not fit to be authorised then reasons were required. Two reports were considered to be suitable for issuing and the majority of laboratories stated that these reports would be authorised. One report had two major errors plus two minor clerical errors and all laboratories would have not issued this report.

Recently, a second marker, PAP has been reported to be elevated in newborns with cystic fibrosis and a combi nation of IRT and PAP may provide improved specificity. ObjectiveTo develop an algorithm based on universal IRT measurements and sub sequent PAP measurements in infants with elevated IRT levels which will maintain high detection rates but reduce the number of cases referred for DNA analysis and the incidental detection of carriers Methods PAP was measured prospectively by ELISA (Dynabio,France) in dried blood spots in 29 CF cases, 32 CF carriers, 314 unaffected infants with elevated IRT and 2,886 infants with IRT values <99.5 th centile. IRT and PAP results were log transformed to give overlapping Gaussian distributions for the control and CF cases, from which likelihood ratios were derived for each individual IRT and PAP result. Results The product of the likelihood ratios can therefore be calculated thus combi ning the information from two markers. Setting a threshold LR of 30 as the action point for DNA testing would result in a 40% reduction in DNA testing and a 50% reduction in the number of CF carriers identified. One CF case would be missed. DiscussionSelecting cases for DNA analysis based on subsequent measurement of PAP in infants with elevated IRT offers a cost effective method for reducing the number of DNA tests and incidental detection of carriers without the need to measure PAP in all infants.

FISH is the gold standard method used; however, this technique cannot be applied to identify small deletions and duplications. Droplet digi tal PCR (ddPCR) is a third generation PCR technology that allows sensitive and precise absolute quantification of copy number variations, without the need for standard curves. These qualities make this technology desirab le over traditional dosage detection techniques such as quantitative PCR (qPCR).Droplet dPCR, using Bio Rad QX100 technology, was used to investigate the suitability of a single primer tailed universal hybridisation probe system, developed in house, to investigate aCGH imbalances. This system can be ap plied to any genomic region in question, and therefore negates the need to use expensive custom Taqman probes for each region of interest, making the system versatile and affordable in a diagnostic laboratory. All ddPCR results were consistent with the aCGH findings, and this techni que was successfully applied in follow up family investigations. Furthermo re, we have shown that ddPCR is sensitive to identify mosaic imbalances. To further increase affordability and to broaden the potential applications of this technique, multiplexing was also investigated, and this has been shown in principle to work using our detection method.

24074,", Menlo Park, CA, United States. Genomic testing has been a part of diagnosing genetic disorders since the detection of aneuploidies using cytogenetic techniques. Technological ad vances in high throughput, low cost DNA sequencing coupled with the availability of a high quality reference assembly have allowed us to inter rogate the genome with greater precision than ever before. Together with increased understanding of the genetic underpinnings of disease, these ad vances mean our success rate in diagnosing genetic disease is higher than it has ever been, however the diagnostic yield of WGS/WES is only 25 50%. Improving this yield requires reexamination of the entire process, including assay development, bioinformatics analysis approaches as well as processes for robustly associating variants with disease. Assay development is critical as no single sequencing method can identify the spectrum of variant types nor can they access all regions of the genome equally. This becomes even more critical when testing for diseases that deviate from Mendelian expec tations, such as cancer or diseases arising from somatic mosaicism. We are also beginning to learn that the reference assembly itself can have an impact on variant identification and interpretation. Our early, simplistic assembly models are insufficient for robust genome analysis and we must develop new models and analysis paradigms. Lastly, processes for understanding how detected variants may contribute to a particular disorder must be ex amined. Every person carries approximately 100 seemingly damaging vari ants, most of which do not contribute to rare disease. Identifying the vari ants contributing to specific phenotypes requires the integration of diverse biological knowledge.",2015

The remaining 30% present a nonsense, missense, frameshift or splicing mutations, distributed along the entire gene. Detection of point mutations is an expensive task in terms of technical and economic issues. The introduction of next generation sequencing technology (NGS) in our la boratory has allowed exponentially increase sequencing throughput. MATERIALS AND METHODS. We studied DNA samples from 60 patients with clinical suspicion of DMD/BMD who had previously ruled out the pres ence of an exon deletion or duplication in the DMD gene. The generation of amplicon libraries was performed using the kit DMD MASTR of Multiplicom and they were sequenced using the MiSeq platform from Illumina. Sequencing data were analysed using Variant Studio and DNA Nexus softwares. The pathogenic changes were confirmed by Sanger sequencing and were compared with the LOVD database and Alamut and Polyphen 2 softwares. RESULTS: We have identified 31 mutations, which have been confirmed as the cause of the pathology. CONCLUSIONS: The analysis of point mutations in DMD gene by NGS is a breakthrough in molecular analysis time and cost, compared to Sanger tech nique. Thus, targeted NGS can contribute to alleviate the diagnosis delay and to overtake the genetic counseling. In those patients in whom no mutation was identified in gDNA, the DMD/BMD clinical diagnosis should be confirmed by immunohistochemistry in muscular biopsies and afterwards the mRNA sequencing.",2015

ORG 282Back to inde x pendent Electrophoresis (2D SDE), a technique of nucleic acid separation based on size, standness, and conformation changes induced by damage. Each specimen is analyzed in sample pairs of non digested DNA to detect single and double stranded breaks and MboI digested DNA to detect other lesions. NLA has been adapted to a microgel platform to improve sensitivity and speed of analysis. We tested NLA on various samples including DNA in solution, intermediate products of complex procedures, various cell cultures treated with genotoxic agents, and body fluid samples from patients. Results: NLA could detect single stranded breaks, double stranded breaks, interstrand and intrastrand DNA crosslinks, single stranded DNA, bulky le sions and mismatches in all types of samples. The sensitivity of the method was comparable to other methods for DNA damage detection. The main advantage of NLA compared to the comet assay was detection of both in trastrand and interstrand crosslinks and other abnormal DNA in a direct manner.

24079,"Recent appreciation of the extent of mosaicism in human tissues, including the brain, implies that analysis of peripheral blood lymphocyte DNA may be insufficient. For correct assessment of CNVs, particularly mosaicism, an even genome extraction is crucial. To determine if the extraction method influences brain DNA quality and quantity, two widely used kits, DNeasy and Puregene by Qiagen, were compared. DNA was extracted from the cerebella of three ParkinsonÃ¢ÂÂs patients and three controls with both methods, using different starting amounts on the DNeasy for four of these. DNA was compared using Nanodrop, Qubit and electrophoresis. DNA purity was comparable. Electrophoresis revealed a smaller main band and more smeary appearance with DNeasy. Increasing the amount of brain tissue (5, 25 and 50 mg) used with DNeasy led to a lower yield per mg brain, and a more smeary appearance. Puregene yielded up to three times more DNA per mg brain compared to the best DNeasy extractions, with yields clo se to the expected value based on cerebellar cell density. Therefore DNeasy yields less DNA of worse quality per mg tissue than Pure gene, and increasing starting tissue leads to lower amount and worse qua lity with DNeasy. Excess protein may prevent all DNA from passing through the filter, and we are concerned this might lead to different relative amounts of parts of the genome, resulting in inaccurate copy number calls. We recom mend Puregene for brain DNA extractions, although we have not compared phenol chloroform, which should also be considered. Funding: Michael J. Fox foundatio",2015

As exome sequencing enters clinical care, a dilemma in testing for disorders with high genetic heterogeneity arises: to order a gene panel test, or exome sequencing? Core to this dilemma is that the sensitivity of each approach is compromised, albeit differently. While the analytical sensitivity for genes on a panel tends to be high, the diagnostic sensitivity of such tests can be com promised through failure to include some genes associated with the condi tion. In contrast, while conventional exome sequencing assays more genes, it suffers from issues of analytical sensitivity, e.g. poor coverage of known disease genes, which in turn compromise diagnostic sensitivity. To address this dilemma, an augmented exome sequencing assay, the ACE Clinical Exome Test, was developed. Coverage of >8000 biomedically rele vant genes is enhanced, with >6000 considered Ã¢ÂÂfinishedÃ¢ÂÂ (>99% of bases covered at 20x).

Two different in house analysis pipelines were applied (dependent upon genetic heterogeneity of diagnosis), designed to maximise sensitivity and diagnostic efficiency, re spectively. Filtering of variants was performed based on phenotypic gene lists, coding sequence location and predicted effect, and minor allele fre quency. Results: An overall diagnostic yield (definitely or likely pathogenic variants) of 42% was achieved across a range of referrals, including large sub groups of ciliopathy and aortopathy patients, and a further 12% of cases had poten tially pathogenic variants warranting further follow up. Horizontal and ver tical coverage were superior on focussed versus full exomes, however, full exome analysis was used to identify a presumptive new gene (for primary ciliary dyskinesia), and facilitated re analysis of data in heterogeneous con ditions with rapidly expanding lists of genetic causes.

The initial data analysis focused on known causative genes, followed by whole exome analysis with appropriate consent. Results: Molecular confirmation of a highly likely or likely pathogenic vari ant was reported in ~29% of cases. ~4% of cases had a variant of unknown significance reported in a clinically relevant gene. A number of these cases highlight a short fall in previous analysis methods. We present four cases il lustrating the clinical efficacy of WES across four different disorders: prima ry immune deficiency, neonatal cardiomyopathy, ectodermal dysplasia, and a neonatal dysmorphic disorder. These cases demonstrate how virtual gene panels allow the rapid integration of recently discovered disease causing genes, which can have a profound impact of patient management.

The exome sequences were analysed with a stringent post sequencing annota tion pipeline including an ID gene panel of ~500 genes for filtering of the data. All remaining variants with a potential clinical consequence were vali dated by Sanger sequencing and tested in the parents for inheritance. After variant filtering we noticed an average of 13 variants per patient (ran ge 2 to 27) requiring further clinical interpretation. The majority of these variants were inherited from one of the parents. Hitherto, we identified 5 de novo mutations and 1 homozygous mutation in 33 patients (18%). For the remaining 27 patients both parents have been sequenced and further analysis is being performed. Without exome sequencing the parents, a relatively high amount of poten tially pathogenic variants remain. All these variants require clinical inter pretation which is very time consuming, while most of these variants were likely benign because they are inherited from one of the parents. With trio analysis inherited variants can be filtered out suggesting that this strategy, at this moment, is more efficient in identifying the causative variant. In the future when databases are filled with more and more exome data and con sequently with more rare benign variants, exome sequencing single patients will become a more realistic diagnostic approach.",2015
24088,"Establishment of diagnosis in patients with suspected genetic disorder presents a challenging task, mainly due to extensive diversity and rarity of genetic conditions. Aiming to improve the accessibility to genetic testing, enhance the diagnostic yield and rationalize genetic testing in Slovenia, we implemented clinical exome sequencing as routine mode of genetic testing for a wide variety of genetic disorders. Our experience offers unique insight into clinical effectiveness of such strategy in daily clinical practice. We performed a comprehensive analysis of patients referred since 2013, including data on referral diagnosis, disease classification, ontological phe notype characterization and other clinical parameters. For each patient, we evaluated the outcome in light of initial diagnosis, distinguishing cases whe re the result either recapitulated initial diagnosis, established diagnosis in undiagnosed cases, or resulted in diagnosis reclassification. We additionally monitored added value of extended exome analyses, including detection of CNVs, mitochondrial variants and exome based linkage analysis. Overall, sequencing in 347 diverse patients revealed convincingly causative genetic variants in 139 (40.1%), with substantial variability across different disease categories. Causative variants were found in referred gene panels in 30.1%, while establishment of new diagnosis was reached in 6.9% and reclassification in 1.7% of cases. In 9 cases, causative variant was identified utilizing extended methods of exome data analysis. In conclusion, we demonstrate the multifaceted efficacy of clinical exome se quencing in diagnostics of genetically and phenotypically diverse diseases. Furthermore, we show its implications in widening national accessibility of genetic testing to thousands diseases, consequentially reducing the need for cross border genetic testing.",2015
24089,"Whole exome sequencing (WES) has now entered the medical practice with powerful application in the diagnosis of rare mendelian disorders. Although the usefulness and cost effectiveness of this diagnostic test is widely de monstrated, there is a critical need for reducing the results turnaround time to make WES a clinical reality. Since 2011, automation of laboratory proce dures and advances in sequencing chemistry made possible a ~50 hours diagnostic whole genome sequencing from the blood sample to molecular diagnosis of suspected genetic disorders. Taking advantages of these advan ces, the main objective of the study was to improve the sequencing results turnaround times. WES was proposed to 18 patients with severe undia gnosed disorders with developmental anomalies, facing a medical situation requiring urgent diagnosis. Each family gave consent and new specimens were gathered. The extracted DNA was sequenced on NextSeq500 (Illumi na) instrument. Data analysis was performed following standard procedu res. Variants interpretation was performed using in house software. Each rare variant affecting protein sequence with clinical relevance was tested for familial segregation. Overall, 4.4 gigabase of sequence were produced per individual, resulting in a mean coverage of 93 folds, with 93% of the RefSeq exons covered by at least 10 reads. Diagnostic rate was of 39% (7/18), with a maximum turnaround time of 8 weeks from specimen arrival to results. Direct impact of a rapid diagnostic for positive families included two pre natal testing proposals, two clinical trials inclusions. Finally, this pilot study demonstrates the feasibility of reducing the turnaround times for diagnostic WES in our primary genetic center.",2015
24090,"Exome sequencing has advanced to clinical practice and has proven to be useful in the molecular diagnosis of rare genetic diseases. At the NIH Un diagnosed Diseases Program we routinely apply exome sequencing in the pursuit of disease causing variants in patients that have not been able to re ceive a diagnosis despite extensive medical workup. An increasing number of our new patients present with prior, negative clinical exome testing. In these cases, given the hypothesis of a genetic condition, the disease causing variant may be hidden beyond the search space defined by current exome sequencing practice. Such false negatives may be caused by a number of fac tors including specific decisions made during data analysis and limitations in the basic technology. We present data from a literature review, plus ex amples from our own datasets where possible, to describe and quantitate the false negative space associated with current practice. Examples include allele skewing, false de novo calls caused by incorrectly called parental geno types, mis alignment, mapable but low coverage regions, non mapable tar geted regions, misalignment and indel errors. Understanding the false ne gative space associated with clinical exome sequencing provides a rational basis for future work on methods for improving detection in systematically under assayed genomic regions.

FH is most commonly caused by mutations ApoB, LDLR, and PCSK9 genes. FH can be treated quite effectively with lipid lowering drugs and lifestyle changes. Genetic testing and cascade screening have been recommended by the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (2008). We have developed an assay, based on a combination of multiplex PCR and biochip array hybridization, which enables the rapid simultaneous detection of 40 mutational targets within ApoB, LDLR and PCSK9. The assay detects 71% of all point mutations in FH patients within the United Kingdom (based on 465 families from a variety of ethnic backgrounds with identified FH mutations).Materials and Methods: A total of 500 patients which met the Simon Broome criteria for possible FH were referred from across the UK for genetic scree ABSTRACTS POSTERS ESHG 2015 | GLASGOW, SCOTLAND, UK | WWW.

Genetic diagnosis of FH currently includes the study of LDLR, APOB (2 fragments of exons 26 and 29) and PCSK9, by PCR plus Sanger sequencing. We present the development of a novel targeted panel sequencing (TPS) approach for the genetic diagnosis of FH. Material & Methods: A TPS panel (LDLR, APOB, PCSK9, LDLRAP1, APOE) was developed using an Ilumina MiSeq platform. Design experiment uses Long Range PCR to amplify 14 different fragments: LDLR (45.66kb), APOB (43.85kb), PCSK9 (26.51kb), LDLRAP1 (26.51kb), APOE (4.84kb). Library preparation was conducted using NexteraÃÂ®XT DNA Sample Preparation Kit (Illumina). Libraries were pooled and sequenced using paired end 2x250bp reads in a single sequencing run. Results: To test this novel approach 16 samples have been sequenced. A total of ~1.28M reads were obtained with 40.000 155.000 reads/sample. The total percentage of bases with >,Q30 was 85.5%. Variants identified by TPS will be presented and compared with those obtained by Sanger se quencing. Discussion: Due to the recently reports of novel APOB functional mutations outside the currently studied regions and APOE deletions causing FH, it is imperative to change the FH genetic diagnosis. This TPS assay includes flan king intronic regions, may be easily expanded to include additional genes and offers a faster delivery of results compared to the traditional sequen cing approach. The 424 FH mutation negative (by current genetic diagnosis) index patients, in our FH cohort, will be analysed using this novel TPS ap proach for patient identification improvement.

DNA recovered from FFPE tissues exhibits varying degrees of fragmentation, cross linking, deamination, depurinati on and other lesions due to formalin fixation, paraffinization, and storage conditions; and as a result, NGS library preparation is often challenging. To increase success with FFPE derived DNA, we developed a qPCR based method to determine quantity of amplifiable DNA and extent of degrada tion. SureSelect XT libraries were prepared from multiple FFPE samples of varying integrity, and enriched using the ClearSeq Comprehensive Cancer Panel which targets 151 genes frequently mutated in solid and hematolo gical cancers.

However extraction of genetic material can be challenging and often results in low amounts or variable quality of gDNA samples, which are further subjected to time and cost intensive downstream applications.

It is therefore widely recommended to perform an initial quality control (QC) of the input material. Especially as only the final step of these workflows reveals if meaningful results have been achieved.

Hereditary motor and sensory neuropathies (HMSN) are genetically he terogeneous disorders affecting peripheral motor and sensory functions. Many different mutations in several HMSN causing genes involved in the de myelinating, the axonal and the intermediate form have been identified, for which all inheritance patterns have been described. The mutation screening currently available is based on Sanger sequencing and is time consuming and relatively expensive due to the high number of genes involved and to the absence of mutational hot spots. To overcome these limitations, we have designed a custom AmpliseqTM panel for simultaneous sequencing of the coding DNA sequence (CDS) of 28 HMSN related genes. We have applied this panel to three representative patients with variable HMSN phenotype and uncertain diagnostic classification because of an uninformative family histo ry and electrophysiological findings suggestive but not fully conclusive for axonal, demyelinating or intermediate form. Using our NGS platform we ra pidly identified three already described pathogenic heterozygous mutations in MNF2, MPZ and DMN2 as disease causative mutations in the three cases, respectively. Here we show that, while utilization of traditional molecular techniques would be time consuming and expensive, our pre custom plat form allows a fast, specific and low cost diagnosis in sporadic HMSN cases.

Diagnostic reports of two ESP external quality as sessment schemes for EGFR mutation analysis were analyzed in detail regar ding the nomenclature. Results. The EGFR mutation was correctly identified and reported in 81 re ports in 2012 and 137 reports in 2014. The number of reports with nomen clature according to the most recent guidelines of HGVS were, respectively for 2012 and 2014, 32.1% and 28.5%. The most used error, was the use of traditional nomenclature (e.g. G719S), respectively 38.3% in 2012 and 54.7% in 2014. Reporting on both DNA and protein level was done by 67.9% in 2012 and only 59.1% in 2014.

To illustrate DeCovAÃ¢ÂÂs usefulness, MPS sequencing was performed on DNA samples from 24 patients using an Ion Torrent PGM sequencer (Life Techno logies). Forty one genes that cause monogenic forms of epileptic disorders were studied in parallel. DeCovA first determines the genomic target regions from either a bed file or a list of genes, then launches the coverageBed tool from the bedtools suite to compute the depth of sequencing on each base of these regions, for each alignment bam files to be analysed. DeCovA uses these outputs to produce graphs that show, above each gene or transcript, the stretches of DNA not covered at different thresholds set by the user. DeCovaA can also draw the sum of the samples covered at different thresholds, which is useful to iden tify the stretches that escape repeatedly the enrichment/sequencing me thods. Bar plots can be displayed for a group of samples, allowing group or method comparisons. DeCovA allows a fast and reliable coverage analysis.

24108,"Klein, Dr. Rost und Kollegen, Martinsried, Germany, 2Zentrum fÃÂ¼r Pathologie Kempten AllgÃÂ¤u, Kempten, Germany. Hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC) is an autosomal inhe rited tumor predisposition syndrome generally caused by germline muta tions in one of the mismatch repair genes (MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, PMS2) that are responsible for repairing mismatches generated during DNA synthesis. Impaired function of these MMR proteins leads to a high risk for colorectal cancer and for other HNPCC related tumors. One of the main aim in HNP CC diagnostics is the discrimination of sporadic carcinomas from the less frequent HNPCC associated tumors. DNA promotor methylation is typically associated with transcriptional silencing of the affected gene. Inactivation of MLH1 due to promoter hypermethylation strongly suggests a sporadic origin of the tumor. Hypermethylation of the MLH1 promoter occurs in 40% of the tumors with known negative MMR mutation status and is very rare in HNPCC patients [1]. Moreover, only methylation of CpG sites in one small region of the MLH1 promoter, the C region, invariably correlates with silen cing of MLH1 [2]. We established an assay for methylation screening of the C region of the MLH1 promoter in colorectal cancer tissue by combining bi sulfite conversion with Next Generation Sequencing (NGS).

Variants are stored into a database and are accessible through a Web front end.

24110,"When does a research finding become a diagnosis? Having sufficient evi dence to convert a potentially relevant Next Generation sequencing (NGS) finding to a concrete molecular diagnosis can be a lengthy process. This is particularly true for potentially novel disorders affecting just one family. Through our NGS based research, we encountered a number of issues that complicated diagnosis including (i) important DNA samples unavailable for segregation analysis, (ii) only partial clinical overlap with a newly described syndrome and (iii) novel candidate genes which require extensive functio nal studies. In the face of these challenges, we have had to use alternative genetic methods to determine pathogenicity. In two studies, one X linked recessive and one autosomal dominant, pater nal DNA was not available to confirm whether the identified candidate mu tations were de novo (likely pathogenic) or paternally inherited (likely be nign). Sanger sequencing and SNP haplotype analysis of unaffected siblings was necessary to determine pathogenicity. For X linked recessive disorders, showing that the mutation is not present in any of the sisters of the patient/carrier mother can help support pathogenicity. For autosomal dominant dis orders, showing that the haplotype on which the mutation is present in the patient is shared by an unaffected sibling who does not carry the mutation adds weight to the likelihood that itÃ¢ÂÂs de novo. For some consanguineous fa milies we have identified causal compound heterozygous variants highligh ting that we cannot always assume homozygosity despite consanguinity. NGS has eased the identification of candidate variants. However, down stream analyses are vital to generate sufficient evidence to support causality and ensure families receive the correct molecular diagnosis.

The importance of mosaicism in Mendelian disorders is being increasingly recognized. Since many proteins form multi unit homo oligomers (repor tedly over half), a small percentage of abnormal copies can affect a much larger fraction of these assemblies. Thus variants in less than 10% of cells can lead to serious clinical consequences. For some conditions, mosaicism explains the previously low yield of clinical genetic testing. Other conditions are obligate mosaic disorders. Furthermore, low level parental mosaicism is increasingly recognized underlying apparently de novo cases of disease. Mo saicism is often undetectable through Sanger sequencing and so has been underappreciated in clinical genetic testing. Detection of mosaicism in whole genome and exome sequencing is ham pered by multiple factors. Variant calling and filtration strategies often miss or exclude variants at mosaic allele percentages. False positives can be ram pant, especially over paralogous sequence regions. Read depths (typically ~30X) achieved in whole genome sequencing, add to the challenge. Exome sequencing can be much deeper, but standard exome coverage is variable, incomplete within genes, and excludes medically interpretable content out side the coding regions. In order to detect clinically relevant mosaicism, sequencing coverage must be consistently deep over all medically interpretable content, and variant calling algorithms appropriately adjusted. We present cases of both somatic and germline mosaicism demonstrating that the use of augmented exome sequencing with modification for mosaic detection allows for the sensiti ve detection of mosaicism. We demonstrate that this approach has proven more sensitive to mosaic detection than both clinical testing and some who le genome based approaches.",2015

Introduction: Compromised nucleotide excision repair (NER) activity causes a variety of autosomal recessive diseases including the skin cancer predis position disorder, xeroderma pigmentosum (XP) and the severe premature ageing condition, Cockayne syndrome (CS). Considering the clinical overlap of NER related disorders and the several genes involved, we have develo ped a new diagnostic approach based on the enrichment of 16 NER related genes by multiplex amplification coupled with next generation sequencing (NGS).Materials and Methods: The strategy was first evaluated on a validation cohort of 11 known patients and then applied to a prospective cohort of 30 patients. Multiplex amplification and sequencing were performed using AmpliSeq protocol on Ion Torrent PGM (Life Technologies).Results: We detected clearly pathogenic biallelic mutations in 14 out of 30 cases (47%). Five new mutations were described in both ERCC6/CSB and ERCC8/CSA Cockayne genes. We also identified two XP patients linked to the very rarely involved ERCC3/XPB gene (only 9 patients from 6 families already published). Finally, the study of a small cohort of 4 unrelated XP patients from the Basque country (Northern Spain) retrieved a common splicing mutation in POLH (XP variant), demonstrating a new founder effect in this population. Conclusions: Despite the small number of NER defective patients, NGS strategy has shown to be particularly relevant, especially for patients with atypical or incomplete clinical phenotypes. NGS is an efficient alternative to sequential Sanger approach and is the essential molecular complement of cellular tests measuring DNA repair activity.

To detect BRCA1/2 germline mutations we developed a next generation sequencing (NGS) routine dia gnostic workflow, based on the Ion Torrent PGMÃ¢ÂÂ¢ System platform. The Ion AmpliSeqÃ¢ÂÂ¢ BRCA1 and BRCA2 Community Panel was handled with a semi automatized procedure for multiplex PCR based library preparation and se quencing. Data analysis required the implementation of a custom designed bioinformatic pipeline for sequences alignment and for the identification, annotation and filtration of genetic variants. Sanger sequencing was perfor med to validate candidate mutations, and to re sequence amplicons having low NGS coverage (<50 reads per amplicon). Negative samples were ana lyzed using the BRCA HP Kit (Multiplicom) for an effective homopolymeric stretches detection. This workflow together with the potentiality of our bio informatic pipeline was blindly tested and validated onto a small cohort of patients previously Sanger sequenced, fine tuning the parameter settings and resulting in a sensitivity of 100% in variant detection. Subsequently, 244 patients were analyzed thus confirming the need of a double check for the homopolymeric stretches with both NGS sequencing and BRCA HP Kit. The NGS based workflow here proposed was able to decrease the overall cost of the conventional genetic test and make the diagnostic process faster than compared to Sanger sequencing alone.

24115,"Current methodologies in genetic diagnostics and research are limited in their ability to uncover all genetic variation in genes of interest. Clinical genetic tests often only focus on exons and therefore miss variants in the non coding regulatory sequences of genes. In addition, structural variants, i.e. deletions/duplications (CNVs), translocations, insertions and inversions, are difficult to uncover. Their robust detection is hampered by the hypo thesis driven nature of current targeted sequencing methodologies: the collection of probes (in hybridization based capture methods) or primers (in polymerase or ligase based re sequencing approaches) determines the sequences that will be analyzed. None of these methods provide haploty ping information, ultimately needed to get complete sequence information. Here we present targeted locus amplification (TLA), a strategy to selectively amplify and sequence entire genes. TLA is based on crosslinking, fragmen ting and religation steps such as performed in chromatin capture techno logies. We show that, unlike other targeted re sequencing methods, TLA works without detailed prior locus information as one or a few TLA primer pairs are sufficient to amplify and sequence tens to hundreds of kilobases of surrounding sequences. This, we demonstrate, enables robust detection of single nucleotide variants, structural variants and gene fusions in clini cally relevant genes. Data will be presented showing the ability of the TLA Technology to: 1) Sequence & haplotype a.o. the complete BRCA1 & BRCA2 genes for the detection of germline and somatic variation in (xenograft) tu mor samples. 2) Haplotype the Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) region. 3) Detect all gene fusions in genes of interest and characterize fusions at bre akpoint resolution in leukemia and other cancer types.",2015

When testing a single gene, the prior probability of causality is high for suspicious variants, which led to the erroneous perception that any ab normal DNA test result is 100% specific. The prior probability of causality is dramatically lower when large gene panels or whole exome sequencing (WES) is performed. This demands a sceptic attitude and a higher burden of proof for causality. Rigorous assessment of the genotype phenotype relati on (deep phenotyping) is essential, and should be jointly assessed with the pathogenicity of the variant on molecular basis alone.

Genotype interpretation mistakes: (1) unfamiliarity with a gene; (2) over interpretation of variant significance; (3) bio informatic mistakes (4) mis judging what is detectable with NGS. B.

It re cruits BRCA2 to BRCA1 bound damaged DNA sites, to mediate homologous recombination. Heterozygous PALB2 mutant carriers have significant cel lular DNA repair defects, whilst homozygous mutant patients develop Fan coni anemia. We recently showed that heterozygous carriers of deleterious PALB2 germline mutations have at least 5 times greater predisposition to developing breast cancer compared to the general population, with increa sing risk in younger age groups.

Depending on mutations the phenotype severity varies from mild hyperphenylalaninemia (MHP) to mild and severe PKU. Early molecular diagnosis of PKU and correct interpre tation is important for treatment planning including possible tetrahydrobi opterin cofactor responsiveness. MethodEach year this EQA scheme consisted of three simulated cases. Over the 10 years 23 different variants and 26 different genotypes were distributed for analysis. Nearly 550 mock reports were quantitatively and qualitatively ana lyzed for a range of criteria including genotyping, interpretation and clerical accuracy. Result Participants came from 23 different countries including Australia and the US; participant number increased from 11 in 2004 to 27 in 2014. The to tal genotyping error rate has decreased from a maximum of 20% to 1.4% although in every year at least one lab missed at least one mutation. Many laboratories have serious shortcomings in genotype phenotype predictions. 2007 and 2012 several laboratories offered prenatal testing for genotypes not associated with clinical symptoms (MHP).DiscussionQuality of PAH genotyping has improved over the years but mutation inter pretation remains a major challenge for a number of laboratories. Availabili ty of improved mutation databases would probably help to further improve diagnostic quality. Grant reference: EMQN",2015
24131,"Real time quantitative PCR (qPCR) to determine copy number was intro duced as a diagnostic service by the All Wales Medical Genetics Service (AWMGS) in June 2014. At this time increasing demand on the laboratory budget, in particular for the send out budget, meant that there was an ur gent need to develop a cost effective strategy for validation of dosage results, particularly following array CGH testing. An in house qPCR method was de veloped and validated that allowed cost effective, flexible assay design for unique and recurrent genomic regions. We are aware that only a few labora tories within the UK have adopted this testing strategy. There are no current professional guidelines or external quality assessment schemes for qPCR. Review of the first 6 months post implementation of this service for vali dation of array CGH imbalances showed evidence of the cost benefit of this service compared with previously available follow up techniques. In addi tion, the clinical utility of this testing has also been demonstrated through detection of a homozygous imbalance in a proband who had inherited the deletion from each of his hemizygous parents. More recently, qPCR testing has also been applied for confirmation of potential dosage imbalances de tected by next generation sequencing (NGS) assays within this laboratory. Further advantages following implementation include targeted prenatal te sting and targeted familial studies, eliminating the possibility of detecting incidental findings. We present a review of the first 11 months of the qPCR service to evaluate whether we have improved our laboratory services.",2015

ORG 294Back to inde x to use assay for the rapid and accurate diagnosis of the six most common autosomal trisomies associated with miscarriage. QST*R PL employs the commonly used QF PCR (Quantitative Fluorescence PCR) technique, which offers numerous advantages over the techniques currently used in the dia gnosis of miscarriage. Methods: A QST*R PL performance evaluation assay was provided by Elu cigene Diagnostics and evaluated using protocols developed by Elucigene Diagnostics. Testing involved 150 anonymised DNA samples extracted from fetally derived tissues/product of conception, whose aneuploidy status was previously determined using alternative testing methods including Karyo typing, FISH and Microarray. QST*R PL test accuracy was assessed through concordance with the previous diagnosis. Results: The QST*R PL data demonstrated high quality results across all te sting sites. Comparison of the QST*R PL diagnostic results with that of the previous diagnostic data showed 100% concordance with no failed results. Conclusion: The QST*R PL assay used in the clinical setting can provide users with a rapid aneuploidy screening service for miscarriage cases and can easily integrate into any existing QF PCR based prenatal service. QST*R PL also enables the identification of maternal cell contamination and speci fic cases of triploidy which are less easily detectible using current diagnostic methods. Such a service can provide closure to patients or couples who have undergone a traumatic miscarriage event and can aid the management by modification of risk calculations for future pregnancies and can change the way recurrent pregnancy loss is managed clinically in the future.",2015
24133,"Introduction: Current methods of detection of genetic markers for haema tological malignancies include the identification of gene fusions using fluo rescence in situ hybridisation (FISH), karyotyping, real time PCR (RT PCR) and screening genes for mutations through targeted sequencing. However, Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) has a number of potential advantages over traditional methods. We aimed to establish a workflow for detecting gene fusion transcripts using NGS, in order to develop a service to detect a range of diagnostic and prognostic genetic markers of haematological mali gnancies. We have validated this method through the detection of recurrent, well characterised BCR ABL1 gene fusions in patients with chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) fusions as a proof of principle study. Method: Whole transcriptome libraries were prepared from RNA extrac ted from the blood and bone marrow of patients with chronic myeloid leu kaemia (CML) and acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) and known BCR/ ABL1 fusions using the Illumina TruSeq RNA Access library prep kit. These libraries were sequenced on the Illumina HiSeq 2500 and a bioinformatics pipeline was developed to detect the gene fusions. Results: This method detected the BCR/ABL1 fusions in the patient samples and can distinguish between different breakpoints in the genes. A compa rison of different algorithms for the detection of gene fusions and a cost benefit analysis of this technique will also be presented. Conclusion: We have shown that whole transcriptome NGS is a promising method for detecting gene fusions which can be developed further to detect genetic markers in a range of complex haematological malignancies.",2015
24134,"Segmental overgrowth syndromes (SOS) are a heterogeneous group of rare diseases characterised by substantial localised or asymmetrical excessive tissue growth manifesting at birth or later in life. SOS encompass disorders such as Megalencephaly Capillary Malformation (MCM/MCAP) syndro me, Megalencephaly Polymicrogyria Polydactyly Hydrocephalus (MPPH) syndrome, Congenital Lipomatous Overgrowth Vascular Malformations, Epidermal Nevi and Skeletal abnormalities (CLOVES syndrome), Proteus syndrome and Cowden syndrome. Due to overlapping phenotypes clinical diagnosis can be challenging. Many SOS have been attributed to mutations in genes of the phosphoinositide 3 kinase PI3K Akt signalling pathway, with both germline and somatic mu tations associated. We have developed a Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) assay for key genes in this pathway with whole gene screening of PIK3CA and PTEN, and targeted screening of hotspot exons in PIK3R2, AKT1, AKT3, mTOR and CCND2. This assay uses long range PCR as the target enrichment strategy and IlluminaÃ¢ÂÂs MiSeq system to perform next generation sequen cing, followed by analysis using a custom bioinformatics pipeline. Assay validation was undertaken across five independent MiSeq runs com prising 20 analyses of 12 patient samples previously screened by pyrose quencing or Sanger sequencing. NGS data was directly compared to pre vious data with fully concordant results. Assay repeatability and sensitivity were determined, and the bioinformatics pipeline was validated to detect mutations down to a 5% admixture. As a result of this validation, the NGS Segmental Overgrowth Syndrome assay is now offered at the Manchester Centre for Genomic Medicine.

The European Molecular Genetics Quality Network (EMQN) is a not for pro fit organization promoting quality in genetic testing worldwide by provision of standard External Quality Assessment (EQA) schemes and agreed best practice. Since 2011, SHOX deficiency has been one of these EQA schemes and involves sending three DNA samples, with matched mock clinical refer rals, for analysis by the participating laboratories. A panel of three assessors using previously agreed marking criteria anonymously marks the resulting clinical reports. Each participating laboratory is scored for genotyping, interpretation and clerical accuracy (max score is 2.00 per category), and tailored comments are fed back. A report summarizing the results of the scheme is also provided. In 2014, a total of 43 laboratories from 15 countries participated in the SHOX scheme. One case involving a patient with disproportionate short sta ture and Madelung deformity (SHOX p. Ala170Pro mutation), had a worryin gly high genotyping error rate of 26%. This mutation has previously been reported to cause an aberrant signal for the exon 4 MLPA probe of the most commonly used MLPA kit. Many laboratories did not follow best practice and failed to use an alternative method to verify this abnormal finding lea ding to an incorrect result. Consequently, the mean genotyping error rate for the scheme was high (8.77%). A full summary of all the results of the SHOX schemes run between 2011 2014 will be presented.

Somatic mutation detection in several codons of the BRAF, KRAS and NRAS genes has a great impact on colorectal cancer treatment decision. The release of benchtop Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) instruments has paved the way to implement the NGS chemistry in a clinical setting without making sacrifices in terms of cost and turnaround time. We developed and validated a PCR based NGS approach for mutation de tection in Formalin Fixed Paraffin Embedded (FFPE) samples. Nine BRAF, KRAS and NRAS target codons are amplified in seven reactions followed by NexteraXT library preparation and sequencing on a Miseq. Except for the challenge of performing NGS with FFPE samples in terms of DNA quality and homogeneity, a thorough validation of the detection limit appeared to be essential. The detection limit is influenced by different factors including the quality of the specimen, the sequence to be analyzed, primer design and PCR bias.

Spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs) are autosomal dominant neurodegenerative diseases, caused by triplet repeat expansions in the most common forms. An EQA scheme, provided by EMQN, has been running since 2004. We assessed reports for 3 mock cases, every year, for genotype and interpretation (score: 0 2). Laboratories were expected to discriminate, and accurately size, both allele repeats for SCA1, SCA2, MJD/SCA3, SCA6 and SCA7; assessment inclu ded also (1) pre test requirements; (2) appropriate methodologies, updated knowledge and acceptable repeat range; and (3) interpretation, reporting and recommendations. Laboratories (28 73; mean: 51) from 34 countries (mean: 22), from all con tinents, increased over time. We found an improvement in genotyping and interpretation, and a decrease of gross errors (range: 0 5%). Mean scores were compared according to the participation of each lab (once, 2 6, 7 10 times). Differences (factorial ANOVA) were not significant, but labs that par ticipated only once had lower scores (1.75) and the greatest heterogeneity. Labs participating frequently had higher scores (1.89) and the most consi stent results. Many labs do not treat EQA as their routine diagnostics.

Therefore, the dental consultation can be an important port of entry for the management of a number of genetic disorders. We have developed a targe ted next generation sequencing (NGS) assay, GenoDENT , for the diagnosis and discovery of mutations in 560 known and candidate genes in orodental diseases. We demonstrate the utility of this assay for the molecular diagno sis of a variety of syndromic and non syndromic dental disorders, eg. amelo genesis imperfecta, selective tooth agenesis, ectodermal dysplasias etc. In a cohort of 104 patients referred to the Reference Centre for Orodental Mani festations, Strasbourg, France, we delivered a definitive molecular diagnosis in 38 cases (~37%). Interestingly, in several cases a molecular diagnosis for the dental disorder led to a refinement of the patientÃ¢ÂÂs phenotype and sup plementary clinical tests in cases suggestive of syndromes, thus having a direct impact on overall patient care.

An effective solution for this challen ging application must be sensitive, accurate, reproducible, fast, low cost and automatable, with robust data analysis and reporting outputs. We developed a targeted NGS method called HEAT Seq (High Efficiency Amplification of Targets for Sequencing) based on highly optimized, multiplexed, molecular inversion probes. HEAT Seq probes incorporate unique molecule identifiers (UIDs) to facilitate the tagging of PCR duplicates and accurate assessment of molecular complexity free of amplification bias. We evaluated the per formance of this technology using a series of normal and cancer reference samples.

24143,", Madison, WI, United States. Starting from only 100ng of gDNA the newly developed Illumina TruSeq Exome Enrichment kit delivers comprehensive and highly uniform coverage of exon sequences. The product workflow consists of three general steps: acoustic DNA shearing, library preparation and rapid capture exon enrich ment step. All steps have been optimized to provide high percentage of reads on target, high coverage uniformity and minimized oxidative DNA damage. It was demonstrated that mutations can be introduced during acoustic shea ring. To counter the observed oxidative damage we added EDTA to our shea ring buffer. Furthermore, we optimized the library preparation procedure to obtain median insert size of ~150bp, which provides optimal enrichment metrics. Also, we reduced the number of PCR cycles to limit the amount of duplicates introduced during amplification, but still obtain sufficient yield to enable flexibility in choosing the amount sample input into enrichment. The TruSeq Exome Enrichment kit is designed for use with IlluminaÃ¢ÂÂs Co ding, Expanded and Custom Exome pools selected using IlluminaÃ¢ÂÂs Design Studio. During enrichment optimization we validated a new wash buffer that further protects the DNA from artificially induced mutations. The com bination of EDTA in the shearing buffer and the new wash buffer allows us to decrease probability of incorrect variant calls. We have enabled pre enrichment pooling of up to 12 libraries for higher throughput without compromising standard enrichment metrics of >80% reads on target.

There are several variant classification systems published. Some are restric ted to specific genes or phenotypes (e.g. IARC [2]; HNPCC genes only), some are restricted to specific modes of inheritance (e.g. Ambry [3]; autosomal dominant and X linked only), and most of them require extensive additional information (IARC, Ambry and Emory [4]; e.g. segregation data, functional assays, RNA data, immunohistochemical data, etc.) often unavailable at the time the report is created.

Population frequency data from several exome sequencing studies and addi tional data (e.g. segregation analysis in families, clinical data, co occurrence of pathogenic mutations, etc.) suggest that certain variants previously clas sified by the abovementioned classification schemes as pathogenic (e.g. truncating variants, variants affecting conserved splice sites, start lost va riants) should actually be classified as VUS [7].

In a unique parallel study design, all patients underwent both the con ventional diagnostic procedure as well as WES. This unique set up allowed for direct comparison of diagnostic outcomes, turn around times and costs involved. Analyses of the retrospective cohort indicated that WES identified significantly more conclusive diagnoses (10 vs. 3, p,0.04), using less gene tic tests (1 vs. 7.72, p<0.01), in a shorter time (12 vs 40 months), and cost reduction for genetic testing (Ã¢ÂÂ¬4,372 vs. Ã¢ÂÂ¬5,321).

Initially, 7 virtual panels were designed jointly by scientists and clinical geneticists with expertise in these disorders (dysmorphology, endocrine, neurology, ophthalmology, renal, skeletal & connective tissue disorders). Patients were phenotyped by clinical geneticists prior to testing using the Agilent SureSelect Human All Exon v5 kit on a HiSeq 2500. Variants detected within each virtual panel were filtered and those classified as potentially pathogenic were further assessed at a Multidisciplinary Team Meeting prior to verification by Sanger sequencing.

24151,"Monogenic diseases are frequent causes of neonatal and infant morbidity and mortality. Routine molecular testing is time consuming and available for only few of these diseases. For severely ill newborns and infants quick molecular diagnosis is important for clinical decision making and can pre vent unnecessary and sometimes invasive diagnostics. Here we describe a procedure and present the first results to analyze 2800 genes in severely ill newborns and infants by rapid whole genome sequen cing (WGS). The procedure is carried out by a multidisciplinary team of pediatricians, clinical geneticists, technicians, laboratory specialists, re searchers and bioinformaticians. Thus far we have included 11 patients and analyzed them with a turnaround time of approximately one week. We have provided a diagnosis of a monogenic disease for one patient who presented with microcephaly, seizures and developmental delay and appeared to have compound heterozygous mutations in the EPG5 gene which is associated with Vici syndrome. We retrospectively tested 4 of the patients without dia gnosis using rapid clinical exome sequencing in trio design, focusing on the same set of 2800 genes, resulting in no additional diagnoses.

Our aim was to evaluate the poten tial for off target mapping caused by the presence of bacterial DNA in the sample. We whole genome sequenced 30 DDD trios (proband, mother, father) to an average depth of 30X on the Illumina X10 HiSeq platform. Parental DNA was extracted from saliva collected in Oragene tubes (DNA Genotek), while pro band DNA was extracted from either blood or saliva. Bacterial qPCR was performed as described by DNA Genotek (PD PR 065). The assay utilises Ã¢ÂÂuniversalÃ¢ÂÂ bacterial primers targeting a well conserved region of the 16S ribosomal RNA gene. The median percentage of bacteria was 5.5% in adult saliva, 27.7% in child saliva and 0.02% in blood. We com pared the percentage bacteria per sample to the percentage of reads map ping on target by WGS. We discovered a high level of correlation between these two parameters. The minimum depth per sample was 10X (35% map ping), and the median depth 27X (90% mapping). Therefore even in samp les with a high percentage of bacteria, a sufficient proportion of reads are mapped such that variant detection should be possible. We find bacterial qPCR to be a robust and scalable method for screening samples for the presence of bacterial DNA. While it may not encompass the full spectrum of non human DNA (e.g. viral, fungal), it provides a cost effec tive method for detecting and filtering out poor candidates for WGS.

Two of the three patients reported died before 11 months of age. Incontinentia pigmenti (IP) is a genodermatosis that segregates as an X lin ked dominant disorder and is usually lethal prenatally in males. In affected females it causes highly variable abnormalities of the skin, hair, nails, teeth, eyes, and central nervous system. Exome sequencing is a technique for sequencing all the protein coding ge nes in a genome. Material and Methods: A new born girl with some dysmorphic features de veloped a skin rash, cephalic hematoma and seizures. She was treated with antiepileptic drugs. MRI and EEG were done as well as chromosomal analysis, Array comparati ve genomic hybridization (ACGH) and exome sequencing. Results: Chromosomal analysis revealed the 4q13.1 22 deletion while ACGH defined the breakpoints. The skin lesion was compatible with IP .Exome sequencing was done to look for variants in the remaining allele of the deleted genes at 4q looking for variants of importance for her phenotype and thus hopefully give possible therapeutic options.

Materials and Methods: A genome wide association study was performed on 94 adjudicated Swedish agranulocytosis cases and 4891 unrelated controls from TwinGene. Cases were genotyped with Illumina HumanOmni2.5 8 and controls with Illumina HumanOmniExpress 12v1 at Uppsala Universi ty SciLife SEQ&SNP Technology Platform. Analyses were performed using PLINK and HLA imputations using SNP2HLA. After quality control, the merged genotype set contained ~600k SNPs. The significance level was set at p<8.39x10 08. Results: The main causative drugs were sulfasalazine, antithyroid agents and antibiotics. Statistical analyses identified significant associations in the HLA region on chromosome 6. After HLA genotype imputation, the strongest signal was HLA C*02:02 (OR [95% CI] , 3.37 [2.25, 4.92], p,8.75x10 10).

24156,"Introduction. Several atypical antipsychotic drugs are associated with me tabolic side effects including weight gain, body mass index (BMI)/blood In sulin level increase. The half life of atypical antipsychotics varies depending on the activity of the CYP2D6 enzyme, but there is lack of data regarding the impact of CYP2D6 isoenzyme polymorphisms on the long term effects, in paediatric patients using atypical antipsychotics. Aim. In this study we aimed to underline the role of individual genetic va riation, in correlation with the CYP2D6 genotype, for weight gain in patients treated with atypical antipsychotics. Material and methods. The study lot included 80 patients, aged between 9 and 20 years, median age being 15.75. The sex percentage in the sample was 55% girls / 45% boys. All the patients were receiving one of the choosen atypical antipsychotic Risperidone, Aripiprazole or Olanzapine. We evalu ated the BMI and the blood insulin variations for these patients in different time points during the treatment with atypical antipsychotics. CYP2D6*3, *4, *5, *41 allele identification was performed. Results. Based on the CYP2D6 genotype, three activity groups were identi fied and compared. The CYP2D6 genotype in children and adolescents with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, proved to be a good predictor for the risk of gaining weight, metabolic ratio and the increase of insulin blood le vel.

24157,"Anxiety disorders are the most prevalent group of psychiatric disorders, and represent a major global burden both to the individual and to the sta te. Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) is commonly used to treat anxiety, and is effective in children and adults. However, a substantial proportion of those receiving CBT fail to remit following treatment. The expense and distress of ineffective treatment is good justification for seeking predictors of response. Genome wide methodologies present a hypothesis neutral strategy for ex ploring the potential of genetic variants as predictors. We have performed GWAS in a global study of predictors of response to CBT in children with anxiety disorders (the Genes for Treatment study, N,980). Although no va riants reach conventional levels of genome wide significance for response immediately post treatment, or at a six month follow up, seven loci are sug gestive of significance. The results of the GWAS suggest that individual genetic variants are unlikely to predict useful amounts of variance in response. However, polygenic ap proaches may be valuable. We have used an independent cohort of adults receiving CBT for anxiety disorders (N,200), to perform polygenic risk scoring to predict response. Genetic variants do not exist in isolation. Using our adult cohort, we have undertaken a combined analysis of genome wide genetic and gene expres sion data.

Introduction: Breast cancer is the most frequently diagnosed cancer and the leading cause of cancer death in females worldwide. Deregulation of PI3K/ AKT signaling pathway has been associated with cancer development and progression and is promising target for breast cancer therapy. Materials and Methods: DNA samples of breast tumour tissues were tested for presence of selected somatic mutations in PIK3CA and AKT1 genes. Ana lysis was performed by primer extension method or real time PCR. Statuses of HER2 gene and ER/PR expression were evaluated by FISH and/or immu nohistochemistry methods using FFPE tissue sections. Correlation between PIK3CA mutation status and clinicopathological characteristics were esti mated with the chi squared test (95% CI).Results: Somatic mutations in PIK3CA gene were detected in 26,1% (63/241). Mutations in the exons 9 and 20 were detected in 36,5% and 57,1%, respectively. Coexistence of mutations (exon 9 and 20) was found in 6,4%. Mutation p. E17K in AKT1 gene was detected in 1,7% (2/115). PIK3CA mutations were signicantly associated with low histopathological grade and ER positive status. Conclusions: Frequency of PIK3CA and AKT1 gene mutations correlates with published data. Marked differences in distribution of PIK3CA mutati ons were found among breast cancer subtypes (ER+ , HER2 and triple ne gative). Alterations involving the PI3K/AKT pathway may have distinct pro gnostic and predictive impacts on patients. Novel combination of treatment strategies, involving PI3K pathway inhibitors, has a potential to improve clinical benefit of breast cancer patients.

In vitro studies using cancer cell lines sugessted that Twist transcription factor might have a role in resistance to chemotherapeutic agents in some cancer types including breast cancer. We aimed to investi gate the association of twist gene expression levels and theraphy response to doxorubicin and docetaxel in primary breast tumor samples. 26 tumor samples were collected from the patients. Chemosensitivity of primary bre ast tumor samples to doxorubicin and docetaxel have been determined by ATP based tumor chemosensitivity assay. Total RNA was extracted by using RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen) from tumor samples. Twist gene expression of tu mor samples were determined by Real Time Reverse Transcriptase PCR by using beta actin gene expression as reference.

Here we characterized the world distribution and origin of CYP3A4*20 mutation. CYP3A4*20 was determined in more than 4000 individuals representing different populations and haplotype analysis was performed using CYP3A polymorphisms and microsatellite markers. CYP3A4*20 allele was present in 1.2% of the Spanish population (up to 3.8% in specific regions), and all CYP3A4*20 carriers had a common haplotype. This is compatible with a Spanish founder effect and classifies CYP3A4 as a polymorphic enzyme. This constitutes the first description of a CYP3A4 loss of function variant with high frequency in a population.

Approximately 10 to 15% of GISTs are lak king the mutations in KIT and PDGFRA and are referred as wildtype GISTs (wtGISTs) which are less sensitive to TK inhibitors. One of the reasons can be the activated RAS BRAF signaling. Material and methods: Formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) tissue sections were collected as a part of the National GIST Registry from 705 pa tients with the diagnosis of GIST in years 2004 2014 and were genetically characterized for KIT and PDGFRA mutations by dideoxysequencing 150 patientsÃ¢ÂÂ samples corresponded to wtGISTs and further 100 patients with mutation in KIT or PDGFRA were included in the study. For the detection of BRAF V600E, dideoxysequencing and allele specific PCR were used. Results: The proportion of the BRAF positive patients (V600E and K601N) in the total cohort of patients with GIST analyzed for the mutational status in KIT and PDGFRA genes is 1.42% (10/705), in the wtGIST subset 6.67% (10/150). Only in 5 cases, the BRAF mutation could be confirmed by di deoxysequencing showing the low amount of BRAF positive cells in the tu mor mass. Two patients of hundred previously identified as mutated in KIT or PDGFRA have harbored the BRAF mutation too. Conclusion: BRAF mutations may affect the response to imatinib of wtGIST and KIT imatinib sensitive mutations representing new mechanisms of primary resistance to targeted therapy in GIST . The BRAF testing in GIST should be taken into account. Co supported by EU sources ITMS 26110230071",2015

Introduction: Head and neck cancer represents one of the most common cancers in the developed world. The main risk factors (tobacco, alcohol, etc.) can cause DNA damage as well as cancer treatments. Therefore, poly morphisms in DNA repair genes may alter the ability to repair DNA damage increasing the susceptibility to develop the disease and modifying the re sponse to treatment and survival. In this work we focused on the influence of these polymorphisms on the disease free survival. Methods: We studied 173 patients with head and neck cancer. XRCC1 rs25487, APEX1 rs1130409, XPD rs13181, ERCC1 rs11615 and XRCC3 rs861539 polymorphisms were genotyped. Statistical analysis was perfor med according to the different models of inheritance (codominant, domi nant, recessive, additive). We stratified the analysis by stages at diagnosis. Results: We found an increased risk of relapse in patients with minor alleles of XPD or ERCC1 (Table 1) in 78 patients with localized disease (stages I and II). Regarding patients with advanced disease (stages III and IV), we studied a total of 95 patients and we did not find any statistically significant results.

24169,"Treatment with unfractionated (UFH) or low molecular weight heparins (LMWH) represents a mainstay for the prevention and treatment of throm botic disorders. Heparin induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) is a potentially deleterious complication of heparin use. To explore whether a genetic pre disposition contributes to HIT , we performed a pharmacovigilance study en rolling patients with suspected HIT and corresponding control patients. Sub sequently, we selected 182 cases and 182 controls for the pharmacogenetic substudy consisting of a genome wide association study (96 cases) with re plication in additional 86 cases, followed by imputing and overall fine map ping analysis. One single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP , rs1433265) from initially 16 identified SNPs was successfully replicated (P,1.5x10 4) and re mained the most strongly associated SNP (P,3.5x10 5) after imputing geno types on chromosome 5. Fine mapping revealed two significantly associated haplotypes with an odds ratio of 0.63 (95% CI, 0.46 0.88; P,5.6x10 3) and 2.41 (95% CI, 1.64 3.55; P,4.9x10 6).In order to find variants not detected in our GWAS but contributing to the association signals, we applied a NGS based targeted resequencing approach in a subgroup of 73 HIT patients and 23 controls for the regions with the 16 most strongly HIT associated SNPs. A C alpha test was applied to perform a gene based test for the impact of rare variants in our targeted region and we were able to detect two associated HIT candidate genes, ICE1 (P , 0.010) and ADAMTS16 (P, 0.005) contai ning 17 and 23 rare variants, respectively. These results provide a basis for further studies that aim to characterize the genetic predisposition to HIT .",2015

24171,"Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a common recessive disorder caused by >1900 muta tions in the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene. About 13% of CFTR mutations are classified as splicing defects. Besides these se vere mutations, other variations are known to modulate the correct CFTR splicing, the most important being the polymorphic TG(9 13)T(5,7,9) locus, which influences exon 10 inclusion and has been associated with mono symptomatic forms of CF. Recent advances in CF treatment have demonstra ted the efficacy of drugs targeting specific classes of molecular defects, such as potentiators (Ivacaftor, already FDA approved and suitable for about 4% of patients) and correctors (Vx 661 and Vx 809 for F508del), opening a new era of personalized treatment. However, no such therapies are available for patients carrying splicing mutations. For this reason, we are exploring the possibility to improve exon 10 inclusi on in CFTR mRNA using the plant cytokinin kinetin, an FDA approved drug previously found to correct aberrant splicing in familial dysautonomia and neurofibromatosis. We tested the effect of kinetin on CFTR splicing in Caco 2 cells, which ex press high level of CFTR transcript and present a significant amount of exon 10 skipping. By competitive fluorescent RT PCR and digital RT PCR we demonstrated that different concentrations of kinetin determine a dose response rescue of wild type CFTR splicing. These results reveal a remarkable impact on splicing fidelity by this small molecule, which may represent a promising therapeutic agent for CF and particularly atypical forms. Moreover, it will be interesting to test whether kinetin treatment can also partially rescue severe splicing mutations in CFTR.",2015

Hospital Universitario La Paz, Madrid, Spain. Introduction: Metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) is the second cause of dead in the world. Development of monoclonal antibodies against Epider mal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR), Cetuximab and Panitumumab, has in creased the survival of patients with mCRC. The efficiency of these drugs depends on the use of genetic biomarkers such as KRAS and, recently, NRAS. It has been found that patients with mutations in these genes have poorer survival rate when they are treated with anti EGFR therapy. The objective of this study is to perform a mutational analysis of NRAS in patients with mCRC, and correlate the findings with the response to anti EGFR drugs. Material and Methods: We performed mutational analysis by pyrosequen cing to detect the commonest changes in codons 12, 13, 59, 61, 117 and 146 of NRAS, in tumours samples of 493 patients with mCRC treated with anti EGFR drugs, and whose KRAS mutational status has been studied previous ly. We also compared the percentage of mutations detected in the different codons of KRAS and NRAS with previous works. Results: We have found 15 mutations in NRAS in 15 tumour samples. Four teen did not have mutations in KRAS. Codon 61 is the most frequently muta ted. The percentages obtained in our study are in agreement with previous studies. Conclusion: This study demonstrates that a percentage of KRAS negative colorectal tumours has mutations in NRAS, and that this status would be related to the response of anti EGFR therapy.",2015

In such ca ses carrier status does not lead to clinical manifestation however, if both parents have mutations in the same gene, the risk for offspring to develop disease is 25%. In our clinical practice we prophylactically detect carrier status in spouses using genetic screening Ã¢ÂÂEthnogeneÃ¢ÂÂ (APEX microarray technology). This screening program can be also used for diagnostic purpo se. It is especially important at pre clinical stage of disorder when there is a chance to prevent disease complications. Materials and Methods: Microarray Ã¢ÂÂEthnogeneÃ¢ÂÂ allows detecting the mu tations leading to 60 monogenic disorders most frequent in Russia. In this study we prophylactically analyzed 336 persons including adults and child ren of different age. Results: 8.6% of 336 genotyped patients were diagnosed to have monogenic disease (table 1). 70% of examined persons appeared to have 1 3 mutations in carrier status. Conclusion: Application of microarray screening Ã¢ÂÂEthnogeneÃ¢ÂÂ helps to reve al carrier status among couples planning pregnancy and to determine risk for offspring to be affected by certain monogenic disorders.

Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is a common genetic cardiac disease. Pre vention and early diagnosis of this disease are very important. Because of the large number of causative genes and the high rate of mutations involved in the pathogenesis of this disease, traditional methods of early diagnosis are ineffective. We developed a custom AmpliSeq panel for NGS sequencing of the coding sequences of ACTC1, MYBPC3, MYH7, MYL2, MYL3, TNNI3, TNNT2, TPM1, and CASQ2. A genetic analysis of student cohorts (with and without cardiomyopathy risk in their medical histories) and patients with cardiomyopathies was performed. For the statistical and bioinformatics analysis, Polyphen2, SIFT , SnpSift and PLINK software were used. To select genetic markers in the patients with cardiomyopathy and in the students of the high risk group, four additive models were applied. Our AmpliSeq custom panel allowed us to efficiently explore targeted sequences. Based on the score analysis, we detected three substitutions in the MYBPC3 and CASQ2 genes and six combinations between loci in the MYBPC3, MYH7 and CASQ2 genes that were responsible for cardiomyopathy risk in our cohorts. We also detected substitutions in the TNNT2 gene that can be considered as protective against cardiomyopathy.

Previous studies suggest an important con tribution of genetic factors to the variation in paclitaxel neuropathy suscep tibility; however, most part remains unexplained. In this study we aimed to identify genetic markers predictive of paclitaxel induced neuropathy through candidate gene sequencing. Materials and Methods: From a series of 380 breast and ovarian cancer pa tients treated with first line paclitaxel, 170 cases (73 with low and 97 with high neuropathy) were selected for sequencing. A custom panel including 40 genes involved in paclitaxel pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, and hereditary neuropathies was designed (TruSeq Custom Amplicon, Illu mina). Libraries derived from patientsÃ¢ÂÂ blood were sequenced in the MiSeq system (Illumina).Results: The analysis pipeline includes selection of high quality loss of function and missense variants and an analysis following two different approaches. First, for common variants a Chi 2 test to compare the number of alternative alleles among the two groups of patients. Second, a variance component test, aimed to study low frequency variants in a gene basis. We found loss of function variants in DHTKD1 , EPHA5 and EPHA8 genes in the high neuropathy group, and a preliminary analysis suggested that rare missense variants were overrepresented in EPHA6 in the high neuropathy group.

24178,"Occurrence of adverse events (ADR) often occur during treatment with aza thioprine (AZA) in patients with chronic autoimmune diseases. The response to AZA is influenced by the activity of thiopurine s methyl transferases en zyme (TPMT): a low activity leads to accumulation of toxic metabolites, a high activity results in a higher production of methylated metabolite and therefore a lower therapeutic efficacy. To date 3 TPMT gene polymorphisms are associated with reduced enzyme function: 238G/C, 460G/A, 719A/G. Response to AZA can be predicted genetically with the study of polymor physms and biochemically with the study of the enzyme activity. Integrated evaluation of TPMT genotype/phenotype is a useful tool in the clinical ma nagement of patients receiving AZA preventing ADR and/or side effects.223 patients afferent to Medical Genetics of Niguarda CaÃ¢ÂÂ Granda Hospital (Milan), were genetically analyzed for the 3 TPMT gene polymorphisms.

Interpretation of these data into meaningful information that could lead to clinical applications, requires the development of novel (bio) informatics tools and services. Here, we present an integrated electronic Pharmacogenomics Assistant (ePGA) that provides personalized genotype to phenotype translation services, linked to drug recommendations. Materials and methods: ePGA is a web service, which combines data from heterogeneous data sources (PharmGKB, dbSNP , Ensembl) and links them to available, up to date, clinical guidelines. ePGA users can query for combi nations of genes, drugs and alleles, and browse related clinical guidelines. Moreover, users may upload genotypes in Variant Call Format (VCF) and re ceive personalized drug recommendations. Results: To demonstrate ePGA we explored genome data from phase I 1000 Genomes Project (1kG). Statistical analysis indicates that pharmacoge nomics (PGx) profiles differ significantly among 1kG populations in most (~75%) of the studied pharmacogenes. In general, individuals of African ancestry exhibit greater PGx profile variation in most genes among popula tions, which can be attributed to increased genetic heterogeneity of African population.

PD (D8Rat42 D8Arb23)/Cub (SHR Lx) strain carrying only 7 genes of PD origin on SHR background. Material and methods: Rat dams of SHR and minimal congenic SHR Lx strains were treated with retinoic acid (atRA, 1 mg/kg at 13 ED) or vehic le. We then contrasted metabolic profiles (incl. oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) and triglyceride and cholesterol in 20 lipoprotein fractions) of adult male SHR and SHR Lx offspring under conditions of high sucrose diet with or without prenatal exposition to atRA. Results: We observed differences in effect of atRA between SHR and SHR Lx strains reflected by significant two way ANOVA strain * atRA interactions (S*atRA). SHR Lx PD5 displayed greater sensitivity to RA induced metabolic dysregulations compared to SHR, including impairment of glucose tolerance (e.g. S*atRA p , 0.04 for glucose at 60 min. of OGTT), a shift towards less favorable distribution of cholesterol and triglycerides into the lipoprotein fractions and differences in size of cholesterol particles (e.g. S*atRA p , 0.005 for LDL particle size and p , 0.004 for HDL particle size).Conclusions: We demonstrated that pharmacogenetic interaction of prena tally administered retinoic acid with a 7 gene region of rat chromosome 8 affects the distribution of cholesterol and triglycerides into the lipoprotein fractions along with other features of metabolic syndrome.

Objectives: Clozapine is an atypical antipsychotic with a unique effect in treatment re sistant schizophrenia (TRS). We tested the effect of clozapine versus other drug treatments on peripheral blood gene expression in a sample of schizo phrenia patients from the United Kingdom. Methods: Blood samples from individuals receiving treatment for esta blished schizophrenia were analysed for gene expression using on Illumi na HumanHT 12.v4 BeadChips. After standard quality control procedures, 152 samples remained, including 55 from individuals receiving clozapine. Weighted Gene Correlation Network Analysis (WGCNA) was used to identify modules of co expressed genes. The influence of the mood stabilisers, lithi um carbonate/ lithium citrate and sodium valproate, was studied to identify their possible roles as confounders. ResultsNo significant change in gene expression was found for clozapine versus other antipsychotic medication at the individual gene or network level. Sen sitivity analyses for lithium demonstrated an association with one gene co expression module at the network level, and thus this was corrected for in the clozapine analyses. ConclusionsOverall, this study finds no significant distinction between the effects of clozapine on gene expression in human whole blood samples versus that of other antipsychotic drugs at the individual gene or the network level.

Oseltamivir phosphate is a prodrug that is absorbed by Peptide transpor ter PEPT1 and effluxed by P glycoprotein. Once inside of the cell, oselta vimir phosphate is converted by human carboxilesterase 1 to oseltamivir carboxilate, which is the active form to inhibit influenza virus neuramini dase.

24184,"Oral lichen planus (OLP) is a T cell mediated autoimmune disease in which autocytotoxic CD8+ T cells (CTLs) trigger apoptosis of oral epithelial cells. Activated CTLs can produce Fas ligand and by binding to Fas lead to apo ptosis. This Fas pathway and the action of p53 tumour suppressor gene are important in producing apoptosis. Current data demonstrate a link between these two factors at the transcriptional level. TP53 encodes a tumor sup pressor protein, which plays multiple roles in apoptosis, cell cycle control, and DNA repair. The TP53 codon 72 polymorphism produces variant with G/C, and the variant lead to an amino acid change in the protein product (ArgÃ¢ÂÂPro). The objective of this study was to assess the association of the TP53 codon 72 polymorphism with OLP . 93 Russian patients of European descent with OLP and 163 healthy donors were studied.

Healthy volunteers which did not have any thrombo embolitic episode or family history of thromboembolism represented third cohort. VKORC1*2 polymorphism was genotyped by ARMS PCR method. Statistic tests used for genetic association analysis were: test of genetic association, adjusted for smaller sample size Ã¢ÂÂ Fisher Exact test (CI 95%); allele and genotype frequencies comparison among smaller subsets exact P value; odds ratio and relative risk ratio. As a result of this experiment, no statistically significant allele association for VKORC1 with either investigated disorder was observed (p>0,05). Also, there was no observable difference in allelic distribution of VKORC1 as mar ker between thromboembolism group and general population. Main con clusions are that in this retrospective analysis, we were unable to confirm that pretreatment genetic testing for VKORC1 polymorphism is justified in addition to standard precautionary measures related to anticoagulant treat ment.",2015
24186,"Trimming adapter sequences from short read data is a common prepro cessing step in most DNA/RNA sequence analysis pipelines. For amplicon based approaches, which are mostly used in clinical diagnostics, sensitive adapter trimming is of special importance. Untrimmed adapters can be loca ted at same genomic position and can lead to spurious variant calls. Shotgun approaches are more robust towards adapter contamination. Untrimmed adapters are randomly distributed over the target region which reduces the probability of spurious variant calls. When performing paired end sequencing, the overlap between forward and reverse read can be used to identify excess adapter sequences. This is ex ploited by several published adapter trimming tools. However, in our eva luations on amplicon based paired end data we found that these tools fail to remove all adapter sequences and that adapter contamination can even cause spurious variant calls. Here we present SeqPurge, a highly sensitive adapter trimmer that uses a probabilistic approach to detect the overlap between forward and reverse reads of paired end Illumina sequencing data. The overlap information is then used to remove adapter sequences even if only one base long. Compa red to other adapter trimmers specifically designed for paired end data, we found that SeqPurge achieves a higher sensitivity. The number of remaining adapters after trimming is reduced by 40 75%, depending on the compared tool. The specificity of SeqPurge is comparable to that of the compared other tools. In addition to adapter trimming, SeqPurge can also perform trimming based on quality and based on no call (N) stretches.",2015

High susceptibili ty for periodontal destruction and the relationship between inflammatory changes, and genetic factors remain unclear. In this study, we investigated molecular biomarkers which play role in the development of generalized aggressive periodontitis (GAgP) using gingival tissue samples through omics based whole genome transcriptomic while using healthy individuals as background controls. Materials and Methods: Gingival tissue biopsies from 23 patients with GAgP and 25 healthy individuals were analyzed using gene expression microar rays with network and pathway analyses to identify gene expression pat terns. To substantiate the results of the microarray studies, Q RT PCR was performed to assess the mRNA expression of MZB1 and DSC1.Results: As a result of gene expression microarray studies, 5 significant gene networks were identified. The most up regulated genes were found as MZB1, TNFRSF17, PNOC, FCRL5, LAX1, BMS1P20, IGLL5, MMP7, SPAG4, MEI1; the most down regulated genes were found as LOR, LAMB4, AADA CL2, MAPT , ARG1, NPR3, AADAC, DSC1, LRRC4, CHP2.Functions of the identified genes that involved in gene networks were cellu lar development, cell growth and proliferation, cellular movement, cell cell signaling and interaction, humoral immune response, protein synthesis, cell death and survival, cell population and organization, organismal injury and abnormalities, molecular transport, small molecule biochemistry. The microarrays and real time PCR resulted in similar gene expression changes, confirming the reliability of our microarray results at mRNA level.

As part of the UKBEC project, we performed eQTL analysis on whole tran scriptome RNA sequencing (RNA seq) data from 134 neuropathologically normal post mortem human brains (180 samples from two separate regi ons: putamen and substantia nigra). After standard quality control steps, the RNA seq data were combined with SNP genotype data from the Illumina Omni 1M and Immunochip arrays and then imputed to the 1000 Genomes resource, before genome by transcriptome association analysis using the MatrixEQTL package. We identified eQTLs at both the whole gene and exon levels. We detected 1883 independent eQTL signals in putamen and 1072 in substantia nigra at the whole gene level and 3523, 1848 respectively at the exon level. We found strong evidence for region specific eQTLs both at the gene and exon level . We also report high overlap (73%,47%) with our previous eQTL study using microarray data. Finally, we compared our eQTL signals with signals obtained for common, consistent Allele Specific Expression (ASE) signals. We found evidence for (1) ASE signals that converted to eQTL signals in a Ã¢ÂÂchromosome independentÃ¢ÂÂ manner; (2) ASE signals that converted to eQTL signals but in a manner suggestive of chromosome dependence; (3) consistent ASE signals which did not convert into eQTL signals.

24190,"Genome wide association studies (GWAS) have linked many single nucleoti de polymorphisms (SNPs) to many phenotypes. Often, one SNP will show associations with multiple diseases, which may point to a shared genetic architecture, and thus common underlying etiological pathways. New me thods are needed to help formally detect and assess pleiotropy in a way that can be applied genome wide. We have developed an approach using Bayesi an inference and applied it to published data on the evidence of association at 107 SNPs, in 7 different auto immune diseases, published by Cotsapas et al. Our method makes use of readily available summary statistics of genetics association, and we use simulations to explore power to detect pleiotropic associations. As the approach is based on summary statistics we can easi ly obtain a probabilistic assessment of each of the possible 2^7 models of pleiotropy. The complete posterior probability distribution not only allows us to determine the Ã¢ÂÂbestÃ¢ÂÂ model, but also to see by how much it improves on the null model of no association with any phenotypes, as well as all other possible models.

24191,"By long read Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) sequencing we are developing workflow for detection of BCR ABL1 tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) resi stance mutations in patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). Our assay enables rapid sequencing of a ~1.6kb BCR ABL1 cDNA amplicon wit hout the need of a nested PCR. This results in a collection of highly accurate full length sequences that represent the diversity of BCR ABL1 molecules in a given sample. Mutations down to a level of 0.5% are clearly detected using this approach. Moreover, the long PacBio reads makes it possible to resolve the mutational composition of all different clones present in CML patient samples. Since compound mutations might confer cross resistance to mul tiple TKIs, the information provided by our assay can directly influence the choice of therapy. Our results also show the presence of multiple splice iso forms of BCR ABL1 in several of the samples. However, we have at present no indications that these splice isoforms play any role in the development of TKI resistance. To evaluate if our method is ready for introduction into clinical routine we are now conducting a pilot project, where CML patient samples screened by Sanger sequencing are analysed in parallel with the PacBio assay. A stream lined workflow has been developed both for the sample preparations and bioinformatic analyses. Also, a web based reporting system has been con structed to communicate mutation results to the clinicians.

24192,We present a novel approach to calling variants (SNPs and short indels) in DNA sequencing data from multiple individuals. The new algorithm is fun damentally different form the existing methods. It uses string matching and pattern recognition to discover and genotype variant alleles. The algorithm implementation (TidyVar) outperforms the current state of the art variant calling software (GATK) in accuracy and speed. In particular it excels in dis covery and genotyping of insertions and deletions. Moreover unlike GATK and other Bayesian variant callers TidyVar can call variants in small targe ted genome regions. We describe the basic principles of the new algorithm and compare the variant calls by TidyVar and GATK on an example dataset.,2015

The most important genetic factors are located in the HLA region, explaining the 40% of the genetic component. In addition, various genomic regions that could be related to the disease have been identified but these regions could vary among populations. With the aim of finding unknown genomic regions related to celiac disease, we designed a new approach based on the ancestry of subpopulations and used it to reanalyze the data from a case/control study of celiac disease ge notyped using the Immunochip platform. First, we defined blocks of haplo types to choose unrelated SNPs, in total 8537 blocks. Then, we analyzed the ancestry of individuals to define subpopulations and the optimal number of ancestries was 30. Finally, each subpopulation was analyzed using associa tion analyses. The results of association analysis in each subpopulation were slightly diffe rent. Although the HLA region was the most significant, the rest of genomic regions that could be related to the disease were mostly different in each subpopulation. 370 out 381 SNPs with a p value<10 4 were located in ge nomic regions that were not previously related to celiac disease. Thus, the approach we developed could be useful to detect genomic regions that were not previously known to be related to celiac disease and to determine new genomic components that modulate risk to celiac disease.",2015

Many SNPs influence common disease susceptibility, but explain only part of the heritability (<3% for BMI). We have shown that the rare variants, like the 16p11.2 rearrangement, can have substantial impact on BMI. To search for more such examples genome wide, we use CNV calls from genotyping arrays of very large number of cohorts in order to identify new rare CNVs associated with BMI. As genechip based CNV calling has high false positive rate, we first deve loped a novel quality score (QS) to estimate the probability of a CNV call being true. To derive this QS we called CNVs for five cohorts (N,6Ã¢ÂÂ628) using PennCNV, QuantiSNP and CNVpartition. A CNV is considered to be true if at least 70% of its length is detected by all software. To predict which PennCNV calls are true, we built a predictive model using different CNV and sample related quality metrics. We termed this continuous predictor of true CNV status as QS. We simulated traits associated with true CNV status and ran associations between these traits and PennCNV calls. Results showed that our QS based association can yield up to 5Ã¢ÂÂfold increase in power compared to classical filtering approaches, in particular for low frequency (<10%) and low quality CNV calls. Using our QS based association we performed a pilot CNV association for BMI (N,4Ã¢ÂÂ381). First results show trends of association for a CNV located 277kb upstream of SH2B1 (P value,0.00336).

24195,"AgilentÃ¢ÂÂs OneSeq is a revolutionary all in one SureSelect target enrichment assay with accompanying SureCall software that detects genome wide copy number changes (CNCs), copy neutral loss of heterozygosity (cnLOH), in dels, and point mutations. The assay comprises a set of backbone probes for CNV and cnLOH, plus user selectable mutation detection probes. Clinical researchers will benefit from the lower costs of a single OneSeq assay com pared to using different assays to detect each type of variation. In particular, low pass WGS cannot detect cnLOH; while focused target enrichment panels are not effective at measuring genome wide CNCs. OneSeq backbone probes are optimized to detect CNC and cnLOH by cap turing high minor allele frequency SNPs. Specificity is ensured via consi deration of Shannon Weiner sequence complexity, DUST score, GC content and mappability. A novel algorithm has been developed and implemented in SureCall to best analyze OneSeq data. The algorithm streams sample and reference data to generate log ratios of sequencing counts. Chromosomal break points are detected from the log ratios using an un decimated wa velet transform. False discovery rate (FDR) is controlled; the breakpoints passing the FDR control are scored for statistical significance. The aberrant intervals are then assigned copy numbers by examining the median values at different wavelet scales. In parallel, SNPs are called using the SNPPET al gorithm, which facilitates calling of cnLOH.

To contribute to this goal, Orphanet maintains a database of genes, loci and non coding RNA of clinical significance in rare diseases (RD). Gene disease relationships are described as: causative mutation (germinal/somatic, loss of function/gain of function), modifier gene, major susceptibility gene, gene playing a major role in the phenotype of a chromosomal anomaly. Candidate genes tested in the clinical setting are included. Genes are linked to a clinical, poly hierarchical classification of RD, and aligned with OMIM, HGNC, UniProtKB, Genatlas, ensembl, Reactome and IUPHAR, allowing for interoperability with mutation databases.

In or der to further characterize this dosage imbalance, we investigated the tran scriptional changes occurring in tranchromosomic mouse ES cells carrying an additional human chromosome 21 (HSA21) (Hernandez et al. 1999). By adding a whole freely segregating human chromosome, this model properly recapitulates the trisomy 21 conditions and offers a way to examine the ex pression of human genes in a mouse genomic context. We used mRNA sequencing to determine the transcriptome profile of these transchromosomic cells, using the parental wild type mES cells as controls. Four replicates of each group were sequenced on the Illumina HiSeq. Reads were mapped with TopHat against a hybrid reference containing both the mouse genome and the HSA21 sequences. A preliminary differential expression analysis (EdgeR) revealed 8Ã¢ÂÂ101 protein coding genes dysregulated in the transchromosomic cells (Bonferroni<0.01), suggesting that the presence of a HSA21 can extensively disturb the mouse transcriptome. Additionally, we compared the expression level (RPKM) of each HSA21 gene (present in 1 copy) and its corresponding ortholog in the mouse genome (2 copies). Interestingly, very few genes showed the expected 1:2 expres sion ratio between the 2 species. Whereas some genes were exclusively expressed from HSA21, others were on the contrary completely silenced.

Existing tools for browsing these SNPs are often time intensive and difficult to use. This issue is further complica ted by the fact that data scientists and researchers looking for statistically significant relationships between eQTLs, genes and disorders often lack disease centric knowledge that would be needed to identify the potentially important single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). To this end, we have implemented a software tool that gives easy and unified access to eQTLs described in published studies and quickly arrive at a list of SNPs that could be relevant for a disease or gene. We have currently included results from four studies that have identified eQTLs in human cells: 1 based on blood , 1 on intestine , and 2 on liver cells. By distributing the software as an IPython notebook, scientists can examine and extend the existing code to include data from other sources as well.

24205,"Exome sequencing is being used by increasing numbers of research and clinical laboratories. However, simple, user friendly exome analytical pipe lines are not readily available.

It is essential for research and clinical disease genetics that indels are robustly detected because of the prevalence of this variant class as a pathogenic mutational mechanism. To enable rapid, automated and robust analysis of exome sequencing data optimised for indel detection, we created the OpEx pipeline. OpEx uses Stampy for alignment, Platypus for variant calling, CAVA for variant anno tation and provides useful additional information such as coverage metrics. OpEx is easy to use, requiring a single command and input FASTQ files to return a tab separated file containing clinically annotated substitution and indel variants in an individual. We evaluated OpEx performance with a set of orthogonal validation data, including 730 Sanger sequencing evaluations. Importantly, OpEx is both sensitive and specific for indels, with ~95% of po sitive and negative sites correctly identified, and a low false positive rate of 3%. OpEx is run independently at the sample level, providing similar perfor mance for any number of samples and thus allowing analysis to keep pace with sequencing output. Due to its excellent performance and suitability for the clinical and lab settings, OpEx is our standard exome analysis pipeline, used to analyse over 12,000 exomes to date.

24207,"De novo genome assemblies using purely short sequence reads are general ly fragmented due to complexities such as repeats found in most genomes. These characteristics can hinder short read assemblies and alignments, and that limits our ability to study genomes. The BioNano Genomics Irys System linearizes long DNA molecules, thus yiel ding single molecules containing long range information. These hundreds of kilobases molecules can capture structural information that may be missed by other sequencing platforms. The assembled genome maps from these molecules can scaffold sequencing contigs to validate the accuracy of the sequences, and to anchor the adjacent sequences into the proper order and orientation. The long range hybrid scaffolds can identify novel chromo somal rearrangements recalcitrant to short read alignment or reference guided assembly approaches. We present a comprehensive analysis of a human genome by combining single molecule genome mapping with one of the most annotated sequence assemblies, the HuRef assembly. Overall, we found that the assemblies of two technologies correspond well, and the resulting hybrid scaffolds are highly contiguous, with a N50 of >35Mb, a value typically unachievable by short read sequencing. In addition, we compared the structural variation with calls previously detected in the HuRef assembly, and found multiple novel variants spanning over hundreds of kilobases in size. Some of these variants reside in areas where the sequence assembly was poorly covered or was highly fragmented; yet these variants encompass numerous genes, and can be of functional importance. Finally, we identified genome maps that span over the remaining reference gaps, and maps that resolve and measure long tandem repeats.",2015
24208,"Structural variation analysis (SVA) of human genomes is usually a reference based process and therefore biased and incomplete. In order to have a com prehensive analysis of structural variation, a de novo approach is needed. As a result of limitations of DNA sequencing methods, it is not feasible to create high quality de novo assemblies for detecting and interpreting structural variation that are refractory to high throughput or short read technologies. Using a single molecule genome analysis system (IrysÃÂ®), we produced high resolution genome maps that were assembled de novo, these maps preserve long range structural information necessary for structural variation detec tion. Dozens of human genomes have been de novo assembled by Irys to date. Structural variation analysis reveals insertions, deletions, inversions and translocations. We have generated genome maps for two trios. From these genome maps, we detect hundreds of structural variants, including large deletions in genes in the mother and son from the AJ trio. We have also investigated the amylase locus in both trios as well as ~20 other individu als and have found at least 15 different structural variants. Human amylase genes have variable copy number and this variation is believed to have been evolved to adapt to increase starch intake. We were able to identify multip le copy neutral variants, i.e. inversions, for each for the same copy number variants. Each genome shows many megabases of variation within genomic regions not included in the hg19, underscoring the need for more de novo approaches to genome analysis.",2015

24210,"Genome wide Association (GWA) studies have discovered thousands of po lymorphisms affecting the risk of various complex traits. For most of these traits, exploration of the identified polymorphisms has revealed that the va riants tend to be clustered near genes involved in few biological pathways. It therefore appears naÃÂ¯ve to perform an unbiased GWA scan without taking pathway/network information into account. Post hoc enrichment analysis only helps in interpretation of already discovered variants; it does not im prove the power for novel discovery. It is now recognized that typical GWAS are under powered to detect all associated variants due to a huge multiple testing burden. This is particularly true for variants that are relatively less common and/or those with weaker effects that could have been missed in GWA studies conducted thus far. Pathway/network information, if properly harnessed, has the potential to improve the power of GWAS drastically. Here we propose a generic statistical procedure that can utilize pathway infor mation a priori while conducting a GWA scan. It automatically enhances the power to discover associated variants that are clustered in pathways. We de monstrate that, our procedure adapts to the data to maintain correct type 1 error (even if the pathway information is irrelevant). At the same time it can give huge power gains if the associated variants indeed cluster in pathways. Our method is fast and easy to implement even with summary level data (p values and odds ratios) from previous GWA studies.

We have validated this platform for common metabolic conditions compa red with standard tests, including amino acid, organic acid, fatty acid oxida tion, vitamin cofactor, pyrimidine biosynthesis, creatine biosynthesis, and urea cycle disorders. Materials & Methods: A state of the art mass spectrometry platform was utilized, and the resulting spectra were compared against a library of ~2,500 human metabolites. The analytes detected encompass numerous classes of important small molecule biomarkers, including fatty acids, amino acids, nucleotides, and other molecules sized 50 1500 Da. Validation samples and exome confirmatory samples were included. Results: For the majority of IEM samples, classic pathognomonic analytes were among the most significantly elevated analytes detected; however, to achieve similar diagnostic outcomes with standard methods, many dif ferent biochemical tests are traditionally required. We found biochemical perturbations in pathways with no available clinical analyte testing such as citrate transporter deficiency. We were able to diagnose aromatic l amino acid decarboxylase deficiency using plasma analytes (3 methoxytyrosine), which typically requires CSF neurotransmitter analysis. In a patient where exome revealed two VUS in the GABA transaminase deficiency gene (ABAT), metabolomic profiling was diagnostic revealing significantly elevated 2 pyr rolidinone, confirming the VUS as pathogenic. Conclusion: Global metabolomic profiling is a novel test able to: (1) screen for common metabolic conditions in undifferentiated phenotypes, (2) reve al biochemical perturbations in pathways with no available clinical analyte testing, (3) diagnose disorders using plasma analytes that were heretofore only detectable in CSF, and (4) aid in interpretation of exome data.",2015

Researchers can readily explore phenotypes and disease correlations, examine candidate genes, and evaluate experimentally defined mouse genotypes modeling a spectrum of clinically relevant phenotypes. The HMDC portal empowers users to search from a human or mouse stand point, using (1) genes or gene IDs for either species, (2) genome locations from either species, and (3) mouse phenotype or human disease (OMIM) terms. Alternatively, data can be uploaded from human or mouse VCF files.

We now expanded this possibility for cases where the locally available computer resources are not sufficient. This has been done by including the possibility to use a remote cloud, such as the amazon cloud, to speed up the alignment process. If requested by the user, remote computing instances are dynami cally created at the beginning of the alignment process and destroyed again once it ends, all transparently for the user. This gives the users the choice to align NGS data on his own computer, on all the computers in his local net work or using the resources of a remote cloud.

Next generation sequencing (NGS) offers unprecedented opportunities to expand clinical genomics but also presents challenges, particularly in the annotation of indels, a highly important variant class in clinical genomics. Annotation in relation to a reference genome sequence, gene transcripts on different DNA strands and potential alternative variant representations has not been well addressed. To address these challenges we developed CAVA (Clinical Annotation of VA riants) which is written in Python. CAVA is a fast, lightweight tool that can be easily incorporated into NGS pipelines. CAVA allows transcript specifica tion, appropriately accommodates the strand of a gene transcript, which is crucial for consistent indel annotation, and flags variants with alternative annotations to facilitate clinical interpretation. We evaluated CAVA in exome data and a clinical BRCA1/BRCA2 gene testing pipeline. CAVA annotated the ICR1000 exomes in 6.5 hours. Evaluation of 25,503 different indels revealed 79% had alternative representations in left aligned and right aligned data. Annotation of left aligned data, as per formed by many annotation tools would thus give clinically discrepant an notation for the 9,543 (37%) indels in genes transcribed from the forward DNA strand. By contrast, CAVA provided the correct clinical annotation for all indels. CAVA also flagged 9,177 indels with alternative representations of a different functional class, which may profoundly influence clinical in terpretation. Finally, annotation of 50 BRCA1/BRCA2 gene mutations from a clinical testing pipeline gave 100% concordance with Sanger data; only 8/25 BRCA2 mutations were correctly clinically annotated by other tools.

In order to contribute to biological characterization of circulating fetal cells (CFC) we performed bioinformatic analysis of published gene set expressed in CFS and obtained the results documenting striking relationship between circulating fetal cells and endothelial cells. The results are in good agree ment with the facts describing trophoblast deportation during pregnancy and its function as the fetal structure directly facing maternal blood. Although there is the evidence of molecular similarity between circulating fetal cells and endothelial cells, the biological behavior of adult vascular endothelium practically excludes the presence of maternal endothelial cells in circulation. The situation is complicated by the presence of endo thelial progenitor cells in circulation. Such incompletely described cells can undergo hematopoietic to endothelial transition and to regenerate vascular epithelium, therefore the spectrum of their molecular markers may over lap significantly with markers detected in blood cells, endothelial cells and circulating fetal cells.

24223,"Genome wide association studies (GWAS) have identified many single nu cleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) affecting complex traits.

The success of GWAS depends on strong linkage disequilibrium at the population level bet ween individual SNPs and trait variants. Regional heritability mapping takes into account the associations of causative variants with all SNPs in a region, allowing the identification of regions affecting the trait where individual SNP effects are small and would be missed by single SNP GWAS. Linkage analyses utilise associations between SNPs and trait variants within fami lies and not at the population level. Linkage analyses have been successful in identifying regions associated with monogenic traits, but less so when analysing polygenic traits in the GWAS age.

24228,"BackgroundRheumatoid Arthritis (RA) is a systemic chornic inflammatory disease of unknown etiology predominantly affecting the synovial joints. Although antibodies are now helpful in making early diagnosis of RA, novel diagno stic and prognostic markers are still needed to improve both diagnosis and treatment. Previous studies indicated the importance of metabolic profiling in uncovering details of pathomechanisms of RA. Untargeted metabolomics approach, together with metabolic networks, allows a deeper investigation of pathways associated with RA. Objectives Using an untargeted metabolomics approach, we investigate metabolic dys regulation in RA cases versus controls and in the sero positive and sero ne gative sub types versus controls. Metabolic networks are further construc ted using correlations between metabolites, to explore metabolic mechanis ms underlying RA. Materials and Methods Blood and serum samples from 236 subjects of Arab ancestry were collec ted. Metabolic profiles were identified using the untargeted approach by Metabolon Inc.. Regression models, that correct for covariates were used for identifying metabolites associated with RA, as well as those differentiating sero positive from sero negative cases. Metabolic networks are then con structed and overlaid on identified metabolites. ResultsSeveral steroids showed significant decrease in RA patients, among which DHEAS has been previously reported. Other steroids which were not re ported before in relation to RA were also identified and were found in the DHEAS metabolic subnetwork. Sero positive and sero negative RA cases further stratified the RA associated metabolites into two subsets. FundingThis study is funded by Biomedical Research funds at Qatar Foundation.",2015

24230,"Understanding biological heterogeneity at a single cell level requires new technologies that miniaturize and automate the isolation of thousands of individual cells and process these individual cells for downstream applicati ons such as NGS or qPCR. Microfluidic technologies have streamlined single cell genomics applications but can do at best 96 individual cells at a time and costs over $20/cell. Droplet based technologies have been shown to process thousands of cells but also hold several productizing challenges including handling emulsion oils and optimizing reaction efficiencies at picoliter vo lumes. In its first product version, WaferGen aims to increase throughput ~50 fold while simultaneously decrease cost at least 10 fold by engineering a simple device based on its proprietary, scalable, micro fabricated chip, SmartChip, which contains an array of 5184 individual polymer coated na noliter wells drilled into a metal alloy substrate. The SmartChip platform has been used successfully for qPCR, genotyping and targeted sequencing applications and is proven for its flexibility in processing multiple samples in a single chip using the MultiSample NanoDispenser (MSND), a microsole noid controlled reagent dispenser that can dispense volumes as low as 40 nl into the SmartChip wells.

24231,"We propose a novel approach for predicting whether single nucleotide va riants (SNVs) are functional in human disease. We use an integrative classi fier that weights component data types according to their relative informa tiveness, and assigns a confidence measure to each predicted class label. We evaluated our approach using pathogenic germ line SNVs from the Human Gene Mutation Database, and neutral SNVs from the 1,000 Genomes Project. The majority of disease associated sequence variants lie in non coding re gions, but currently only two other recently proposed predictors exist for these variants. Using a weighted combination of four data sources, our me thod significantly outperforms both competing methods, and is currently state of the art. The most highly weighted data source is sequence conser vation across species: a variant in a highly conserved region has a higher probability of disease association than variants in regions of high variability. If we focus on examples with a confidence measure above 90%, the classi fier achieves 96% test accuracy while making predictions on nearly 40% of examples; at a 95% confidence cutoff, accuracy increases to 98% with predictions for nearly 16% of examples. In coding regions, our model uses a weighted combination of 10 sources of data and is as accurate as the top competing algorithms. We have also devised disease specific predictors and provide a web browser for visualising the results from these studies.

24232,"Sanger sequencing using capillary electrophoresis (CE) has been considered gold standard for identifying disease causing mutations due to its robust ness, low error rate, ease of use, visual display of the electropherogram, and low cost per sample and target. Homozygous and heterozygous germline mutations are reliably detected using DNA sequencing analysis software such as the Applied Biosystems Variant ReporterÃ¢ÂÂ¢ software. However, soma tic variants with an allelic proportion of 25 % or less are often not Ã¢ÂÂcalledÃ¢ÂÂ by the software and thus escape awareness if not detected by careful visual inspection of the electropherogram. With the rapid adoption of next genera tion sequencing technology (NGS) and its use for characterization of specific and discrete mutations in tumor samples, a need has emerged to establish an orthogonal technology for reliable and sensitive detection of somatic mu tations which may occur at proportions of 10% or lower compared to the normal allele. To this end, we have developed innovative algorithms, soft ware, and a protocol that specialize in the detection of minor mutations by Sanger sequencing. Using panels of prepared mixtures of minor alleles in the range of 2.5%, 5%, 10% and 20 %, we have achieved 92% sensitivity and 98.5 % specificity for detection of mutations present at the 5 % level with high quality data. In conclusion, we have demonstrated that standard protocols for fluorescent dye terminator Sanger sequencing in conjunction with the new Variant Caller may enable identification of de novo somatic mutations to a level of 5% which will also be useful for the confirmation of minor variants identified by NGS platforms.",2015

A major difficulty concerning the spliceosomal functional ana lysis arises from the large number of proteins involved and their dynamic interactions within spliceosomal sub complexes. The aim of this study is the in silico reconstruction of the protein protein interaction (PPI) network of the human spliceosome. We identified the proteins that have been isolated as subunits of the human spliceosome and/or its subcomplexes, based on all the relevant publicati ons. Direct PPIs between spliceosomal components were retrieved from the human interactome knowledge base, PICKLE_DB augmented with PPIs for the D. melanogaster and C. elegans orthologous to human spliceosomal pro teins from the DroID and Worm Interactome Database. A thorough manual curation of the acquired data and the supporting publications ensured a fi nal set of confidently direct PPIs. The proteome of the human spliceosome comprises 630 proteins, 60% of which can be assigned to specific spliceosomal sub complexes. The recon structed spliceosomal PPI network, which follows the power law distribu tion, consists of 457 nodes and approximately 1600 edges. Approximate ly 25% of the proteins nodes have been associated with genetic diseases, making the reconstructed network a valuable platform for suggesting do cumented functional relationships between genes, diseases and the topolo gical structure of the interactome.ÃÂcknowledgments:Financial support: Ã¢ÂÂ Aristeia ÃÂÃÂÃ¢ÂÂ that is implemented under the NSRF Ã¢ÂÂOPERATIONAL PROGRAMME EDUCATION AND LIFELONG LEARNINGÃ¢ÂÂ and is co funded by the E.

24234,"It is almost impossible to store or analyze such large scale NGS data with a traditional method on a commodity server. Hadoop is an alternative to this requirement. We aim to address the issues involved in the large scale data analysis on the cloud in bioinformatics. Accordingly, we propose a Hadoop based algorithm HAVS for predicting genomic variations at least 1000 bp and related to diseases. Our algorithm consists of 3 steps in MapReduce workflow. The first step is to classify the sequences as normal sequences, of which the direction of pai red end reads is correct and in which the mapping distance belongs to the range of ÃÂ±2.7SD standard deviation of the mean fragment size of the reads, and the sequences that do not belong to the range as variation. The second analysis process is to compute the mean insert size of sequences by structu ral variation types for only the sequences regarded as structural variation. The third analysis step is to cluster the structural variation sequences on the basis of the information computed in the above analysis process, and to predict a breakpoint in which structural variation occurred. The algorithm covers the structural variation types such as segmental duplication, copy number variation, translocation, inversion, insertion, and deletion. The ex periments are performed on Hadoop clusters with the proposed algorithm and the YRI sequencing data provided by the 1000 Genome Project. The experimental results show that our proposed algorithm based on Hadoop is more accurate, efficient, and applicable to the prediction of genome struc tural variations.",2015
24235,"Structural variants (SVs), defined as the rearrangement or removal of ge nomic regions, are major sources of genetic diversity in human populations and directly responsible for the pathogenesis of numerous diseases. Many studies have been conducted in the past decade to discover and analyze SVs, however these have predominantly focused on unbalanced (copy number variant) events involving only one or two breakpoints. In contrast, more complex rearrangements resulting from multi step or overlapping events involving three or more breakpoints have received considerably less atten tion or have been incorrectly interpreted. We have developed an algorithm, SVelter, which accurately identifies and resolves both simple and complex rearrangements using whole genome, paired end sequencing data. This method first detects regions of the genome that are suspected to involve a structural variant by clustering sets of candidate breakpoints using aberrant read pair and split read mappings. The resulting segments are then itera tively rearranged in a randomized fashion and scored against null models of expectation based on library insert length, read orientation, sequence depth, and spanning coverage. We applied our algorithm to simulated ge nomes containing both simple and complex events and show a comparable accuracy for simple deletions, duplications and inversions, as compared to modern SV calling methods. However, SVelter outperforms these approa ches on more complex rearrangements, showing a higher sensitivity wit hout significant loss of specificity across different levels of sequence cove rage as assessed using individual haplotype structures. We have also reex amined well characterized genomes from the 1000 Genome Project (1KGP) that have been deeply sequenced and compared our results to the reported structural variants in these samples.",2015
24236,"Background: Sex differences in gene transcription levels have been studied in specific diseases and specific tissues. It is important to identify normal sex dependent differences in transcription levels, which can only be studied in population cohorts of large enough size. Methods: We studied differences in autosomal gene expression levels bet ween males and females in two Finnish population cohorts, the Young Finns Study (YFS, N,1255) and DILGOM (N,518), having genome wide transcrip tional coverage (>30,000 transcripts) from whole blood detected with Illu mina HumanHT 12 BeadChips. The cohorts were analyzed separately using linear regression and meta analyzed with random effects meta analysis. Covariates included age, BMI and smoking, and women using contraceptive pills or pregnant were excluded from the analyses. Results: After correction for multiple testing, 992 autosomal transcripts (3.5%) in 949 genes showed differential expression between sexes. Gene en richment analysis revealed significant enrichment of six Gene Ontology (GO) Terms including immune system process (p value,4.9e 25) and response to stress(p value,9.8e 6). Altogether 77 genes with GO terms related to li pids or lipoproteins showed differential expression in males and females. Interestingly, the Lipase A (LIPA) gene showed higher expression levels in males (0.54 increments in SD), with p value 5.34e 28. This gene encodes lysosomal acid lipase, an essential enzyme for the hydrolysis of triglycerides and cholesteryl esters in lysosomes. Conclusions: A high number of genes show different levels of expression between sexes when studied in a population cohort setting. These analyses can potentially pinpoint complex disease risk factor genes (e.g. LIPA) that may have a differential effect to the risk factor between males and females.",2015

However, the biological context in which these genetic risk factors exert their biological effect is often unknown. Here, the analysis of genetic variants that influence gene expression (eQTLs) has gained major impor tance. The aim of our present study was to systematically map eQTLs in human hair follicle that can be used to functionally annotate genetic risk factors for hair related traits. Genome wide genotyping of blood DNA and transcriptome profiling of hair follicle RNA was performed on IlluminaÃ¢ÂÂs OmniExpress and HT12v4 arrays. After imputation of genotypes and qua lity control, a total of 6,593,881 SNPs and 14,687 expression probes from 97 individuals remained for analysis. The genome wide eQTL analysis identified 2,883 independent cis and 224 trans eQTLs. A comparison with published eQTL data from peripheral blood and brain revealed hair folli cle specificity for about ~40% of the cis eQTLs (N,1,159). The strongest hair specific effects were observed for SNHG8, MRPL43 and XYLT1. IPA pathway based analysis revealed an enrichment for hair eQTL genes in several pathways. Among the top findings are the androgen and prolactin signaling pathway which have been implicated in hair growth (de)regulati on and the melanocyte development and pigmentation signaling. It is hoped that integration of the present data with GWAS findings will help to pinpoint novel candidate genes and pathways and to further elucidate the biological mechanisms that contribute to the development of hair loss disorders and hair related phenotypes.",2015
24240,"The hexanucleotide repeat expansions (REs) in the non coding region of C9orf72 are by far the most frequent cause of amyotrophic lateral sclero sis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia, accounting for a large proportion of both familial and sporadic cases. The basis for C9orf72 carriers clinical heterogeneity remains unknown. Recently the association between C9orf72 promoter methylation and histone trimethylation with its transcriptional si lencing and with decreased accumulation of RNA foci and dipeptide repeat protein aggregates suggested that epigenetic modification of C9orf72 could mitigate disease pathogenesis. To consolidate this hypothesis we studied C9orf72 promoter methylation in 44 C9orf72 positive and 22 C9orf72 negative ALS patients using bisulfite conversion coupled with next generation sequencing (NGS). When possible, we also performed quantitative PCR on RNA isolated from blood to determi ne C9orf72 expression. As a result from BS sequencing, 91% of C9orf72 negative patients were un methylated, while 32% of carriers had more than three methylated CpG si tes. Performing NGS, we estimated with accuracy the percentage of methyla tion at each CpG site; this allowed us to refine the previous classification, dividing the samples in five different classes and concluding that only 27% of carriers had medium or high degree of methylation. While methylation levels didnÃ¢ÂÂt correlate with age at onset, they were mild correlated with di sease duration and were inversely associated with repeats length. Quantita tive PCR confirmed the correlation between C9orf72 promoter methylation and lower levels of C9orf72 RNA. Hence our data support the hypothesis that epigenetic silencing of mutant C9orf72 and its subsequent diminished expression are associated with less aggressive disease.",2015

Loss of methylation at IC2 on the maternal chromosome is found in 50% of persons with BWS. Hypomethylation at IC1 on the paternal chromosome is identified in 35% 50% of individuals with RSS. Other causes of BWS and RSS are uniparental disomy (UPD) of chromosome 11p15.5 (BWS) and 7 (RSS), deletion/dupli cation, inversion and translocation of 11p15.5 and mutations in the CDKN1C gene.

Here, we have analyzed genomes of 188 children with intellectual disability, autism, epilepsy and/or congenital malformations using SNP/oligonucleotide molecular karyoty ping (Affymetrix) and an original bioinformatic technology for addressing phenotypic, cellular and molecular consequences of genomic/epigenomic variations. SLOH, specific to clinical manifestations in these children, were found in 6 cases (3.2%). It is to note that parental consanguinity was not initially reported in all these cases. In one child, Meier Gorlin syndrome was diagnosed. Other cases were also associated with hereditary diseases. Two cases of SLOH indirectly related to the phenotype were associated with mi crodeletions in 14q22.1 and 15q15.2, respectively.

The majority of the studies, working on biomar ker discovery, focused on chromosome 21 but the phenotypic characteri stics of Down syndrome (DS) suggest that can be related to genes located on other chromosomes as well.

Association studies of identified DEGs with Down syndrome phenotype were performed. Multiple trisomy 21 specific DEGs, 175 in num ber, were identified and found to be located across the whole genome. Nine of them were directly associated with the DS phenotype. Furthermore, many of the remaining DEGs were indirectly associated through pathological con ditions occurring in DS. Findings of this study strongly support the hypothe sis that DS phenotype is expressed from the disruption of the whole genome and not only chromosome 21 encoded genes. DEGs could eventually be used as fetal specific biomarkers for the identification of trisomy 21 from normal fetuses.

T lymphocytes from patients with CF are characterized by reduced expression of anti in flammatory cytokines, such as IL 10 and elevated level of pro inflammatory cytokines (e.g. IL 8). Epigenetic factors such as DNA methylation or histone modifications might contribute in cytokine dysregulation during CF. DNA methylation is catalyzed by DNA methyltransferase enzymes (DNMTs).In this study the correlations between levels of DNMT1, DNMT3a and IL 10 were investigated in T lymphocytes derived from CF patients and healthy subjects. T lymphocytes were isolated by ficoll gradient centrifugation with subsequent purification and cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 5% L glutamine and 10% FCS, with presence or absence of 5 azacyti dine (5 AzaC; Sigma Aldrich), a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor, for 24h. T cells were activated with ionomycin (250 ng/ml) and PMA (20ng/ml). Le vels of DNMT1 and DNMT3a were measured in nuclear extracts using DN MTs assay kits (Abcam, UK). IL 10 amount from supernatant of T cell culture was quantified by ELISA kit (Abcam, UK).We have found that T lymphocytes from CF patients express elevated level of DNMT3a (40%), while no significant changes was observed at levels of DNMT1 compared to healthy subjects. In presence of the high dose of 5 A zaC (6ÃÂ¼mol/L) the level of DNMT3a was decreased which was accompanied by an increased amount of IL 10.These findings show the immunomodulatory effect of 5 azaC in CF T lym phocytes. Since aberrant epigenetic modifications are potentially reversible epigenetic drugs might represent targets for Cystic Fibrosis therapy. Further work will involve evaluation of a promoter methylation status of cytokine genes in CF T cells .",2015

Its pathogenesis and progression are related with chronic oxidative stress an important mechanism for glucose toxicity. The aim of our study was to define the epigenetic alterations in DM2. First, we have determined mRNA expression levels of methyl CpG binding domain protein 2 (MBD2) in 16 patients and 12 controls. Then, we have analyzed DNA methylation status of 22 genes, connected to stress and toxicity, in four DNA pools of: 20 healthy controls; 20 initial DM2 patients; 20 patients with DM2 for less and 20 patients with DM2 for more than five years. The expres sion analysis and methylation status survey were performed by Real Time PCR, preceded by reverse transcription and restriction with methylation sensitive and methylation dependent enzymes, respectively. Our results show that MBD2 has increased expression in DM2 (more than 4 times). From the genes analyzed for promoter methylation, four show in creasing methylated fraction with the course of DM2: BRCA1 (0% in healthy controls; 5.9% in initial DM2; 0.5% in DM2 for less than 5 years and 47.8% in DM2 for more than 5 years), CCND1 (0%, 13.6%, 14.7% and 34.1%, re spectively), SCARA3 (3.5%, 8.1%, 20.2% and 23.3%, respectively) and Prdx2 (7.3%, 22.3%, 22.4% and 32%, respectively).ABSTRACTS POSTERS ESHG 2015 | GLASGOW, SCOTLAND, UK | WWW.

Studies in rodents and in humans revealed that it is an aggressive reproductive system toxicant. The possible impact of DEHP exposure during pregnancy in mice was as sessed on sperm count and on DNA methylation by MBD sequencing in the F1 male generation using two different genetic backgrounds, C57BL6 and FVB mice. DEHP exposure induced a C57BL6 strain dependent statistical ly significant reduction in sperm counts (p , 8.7x10 4) with no detectable impacts in the other strain tested (FVB mice, p, 0.9). In the sperm of DEHP exposed F1 mice, MBD sequencing analysis taking in account the strain and the DEHP exposure revealed statistically significant DNA methylation enrichments in promoters of four genes: Tmem125, Piwil2, Fkbp1a and Smim8. Among them, Piwil2 was previously shown to be hyper methylated in the testicular samples of human infertile males, whereas Fkbp1a stimu lates sperm motility. Piwil2 and piwil4 were the two most significant and recurrent candidates identified in the approach targeting genes involved in reproduction according to Go terms. Transcription level of a subset of tar gets was tested by RT qPCR on sperm RNA. Results showed that promoter methylation was globally inversely correlated with gene expression. Finally, functional genetic variations between both mice strains were localized on some of the targets identified by MBD sequencing. This study reveals an important strain dependent impact of DEHP exposure during pregnancy on the production of sperm cells. It was associated with epigenetic dysregulation occurring in genes involved in the reproduction process.",2015

Introduction: Familial Mediterranean Fever (FMF) mostly exhibiting auto somal recessive inheritance (1:1000 in Turkey) is the most common autoin flammatory disease. More than 200 FMF associated variations have been re ported in the MEFV gene. MEFV gene expression levels are generally low in FMF patients compared to healthy controls, and further decrease has been observed during attacks which appears to be associated with inflammation, Furthermore, methylation level of exon 2 of MEFV was found to be higher in FMF patients which reversely correlates with expression. In this study, in addition to the link between DNA and histone lysine methylation, we wan ted to explore heterochromatin and euchromatin modifications in FMF pati ents during the attack and attack free period in order to assess whether the modifications are related to inflammation. Materials and Methods: This study included 10 FMF patients during the attack and attack free period and 10 age gender matched healthy con trols. Modification specific antibodies (trimethylation(me) of H3K9 and H3K4) are used for chromatin immunoprecipitation(ChIP) experiments to enrich modified regions in Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells (PBMCs) isolated from peripheral blood.

24253,"Introduction: The coagulation factor fibrinogen is expressed and secreted by hepatocytes and its circulating concentration is associated with cardio vascular disease (CVD) risk. Three clustered genes (FGA, FGB and FGG) en code the three polypeptide components of fibrinogen. They are coordinately regulated and we previously identified two intergenic enhancer elements. Our aim is to uncover further regulatory elements and understand how local chromatin architecture influences fibrinogen expression. Materials and Methods: A luciferase reporter assay in fibrinogen expressing (HepG2) and non expressing (HEK 293T) cells and a transgenic zebrafish assay were used to demonstrate liver enhancer activity for predicted regu latory sequences near the fibrinogen locus. Chromatin interactions will be assessed by chromatin conformation capture and their role in the regulation of fibrinogen expression studied using CRISPR Cas9 editing. Results: We identified two enhancers flanking the fibrinogen locus. Each sequence enhances reporter gene activity in HepG2 cells irrespective of ori entation and position with respect to a fibrinogen promoter, and one drives liver transgene expression in zebrafish larvae. ENCODE chromatin immuno precipitation sequencing data demonstrate that each enhancer is bordered by CTCF and RAD21 interaction sites, suggesting that the extremities of the gene cluster may be looped together. We are investigating the functional im portance of these potential interactions. Conclusions: The fibrinogen locus is flanked by liver enhancers and may adopt a looped conformation. Demonstrating functional importance of this looping in the regulation of fibrinogen expression could link chromatin in teractions to circulating fibrinogen levels, and ultimately to CVD risk.

24254,"Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is caused by CGG expansion over 200 repeats at the 5Ã¢ÂÂ UTR of the FMR1 gene and subsequent DNA methylation of both the expanded sequence and the CpGs of the promoter region. This epigenetic change causes transcriptional silencing of the gene. We have previously demonstrated that 5 aza 2 deoxycytydine (5 azadC) treatment of FXS lym phoblastoid cells reactivates the silent gene, allowing CpG sites demethylati on, increased acetylation of histones H3 and H4 and methylation of lysine 4 on histone 3. Recently we observed that reactivation of FMR1 transcription is long lasting, up to a month after a 7 days treatment with 5 azadC, and that maximum level of transcription are reached 10 15 days after 5 azadC last administration. In order to check the specificity of the 5 azadC induced DNA demethylation, we performed bisulphite sequencing of the entire methyla tion boundary upstream the FMR1 promoter region, which is preserved in WT cells [Naumann et al., 2009]. We did not observe any modification of the methylation boundary after treatment. Furthermore, methylation ana lysis by MS MLPA of PWS/AS and BWS/SRS loci demonstrated that 5 azadC treatment has no demethylating effect on these regions. Methylation ana lysis through Infinium 450K (Illumina) revealed no significant changes in differentially methylated regions after treatment. Taken together these data show that 5 azadC has a long lasting reactivating effect on the mutant FMR1 gene and that its demethylating effect on genomic DNA is not random but rather restricted to specific regions.

FSHD (affecting ~1 in 20,000 individuals) is an autosomal dominant epige netically regulated disorder, with characteristic pattern of progressive mus cle involvement commencing in the face and shoulder girdle. Two clinically indistinguishable forms differ in molecular basis of epigenetic regulation, but are underpinned by hypomethylation of 4q35, causing aberrant DUX4 expression (toxic transcription factor). FSHD1 (OMIM158900) (95% cases) caused by contraction of D4Z4 repeats, results in allele specific hypom ethylation. FSHD2 (OMIM158901) (~3% of cases), contraction indepen dent, is caused by mutations in SMCHD1, encoding a chromatin modulating enzyme, resulting in global hypomethylation and chromatin relaxation of D4Z4 arrays. A permissive haplotype at 4q35 is required for clinical expres sion of FSHD1 and 2, necessitating digenic inheritance for FSHD2.BGL provides a UKGTN specialist diagnostic service for FSHD processing >500 UK/international referrals annually. Clinically typical (assessed by cli nical proforma) deletion negative patients (4.8% referrals) are tested for FSHD2 by 4q35 methylation quantification (pyrosequencing) followed by SMCHD1 sequencing of hypomethylated patients.

24256,"The human RB1 gene is imprinted, carrying a differential methylation mark at an intronic CpG island (CpG85) on the maternal chromosome and sho wing biased expression of full length RB1 in favor of the maternal allele. On the unmethylated paternal allele, CpG85 serves as promoter for an alterna tive RB1 transcript, which starts at a novel exon 2B and possibly interferes with expression of the RB1 gene from the main promoter. CpG85 is part of the PPP1R26P1 pseudogene, which integrated into intron 2 of the RB1 gene by retrotransposition. To study if integration of a pseudogene sequence per se is sufficient to induce differential methylation and imprinting, we genera ted a knock in mouse, carrying human PPP1R26P1 in intron 2 of the mouse Rb1 gene. Using next generation bisulfite amplicon sequencing, we analyzed acquisiti on of DNA methylation at CpG85 in several tissues in male and female hete rozygous mice after either maternal or paternal transmission of PPP1R26P1. We observed a tissue specific pattern of DNA methylation with high levels in neuroectodermal tissue, like brain and eye, but low levels in all other tissues tested. This pattern was observed independent of parental transmission, in dicating that CpG85 in the human pseudogene does not act as stable gametic DMR in the mouse. Preliminary analysis of CpG85 methylation in germ cells showed that it is unmethylated in sperm and in oocytes.

24257,"Genomic imprinting is an epigenetic gene marking phenomenon that occurs in the germline and results in monoallelic expression according to parental origin. Our hypothesis is that imprinted genes in humans can be predicted by the methylation level of CpG sites within that gene region. We also ex pect that the variability of beta values is smaller within imprinted genes as they have more semi methylated probes and therefore more medium beta values. For this study 17 tissues from 4 individuals were collected during autopsy. DNA methylation analysis was performed with the Illumina Infinium Hu manMethylation450 BeadChip in Estonian Genome Centre. As a result, all imprinted genes (n,77) demonstrated less variability in the methylation level (p < 0.01) across all 17 tissues when compared to non imprinted genes. We visualized the CpG patterns of known imprinted genes across all tissues. The visualized CpG patterns confirmed tissue specific na ture of imprinted genes. We found a tissue specific switch of imprinted sta tus across somatic tissues for two genes MKRN3 and KCNQ1DN. CpG pat terns also showed expression specific patterns of genes, such as bi allelic, monoallelic or combined expression. We also found that methylation pat tern remains stable not depending on a gene being expressed or not.

The cause of IDs is an aberrant expression of imprinted genes due to genetic or epigenetic abnormalities. At present, there are eight clinically well recognized IDs. Be cause of high variability of clinical phenotype and molecular alterations, the exact prevalence of IDs is not known. Methods: In this study we retrospectively reviewed records of all Estonian patients with molecularly confirmed ID diagnosis during the period 1998 2014.Results: A total of 52 individuals with IDs were identified. 46% (24) of them had Prader Willi syndrome (PWS), 23% (12) Angelman syndrome (AS), 13%(7) Beckwith Wiedemann syndrome (BWS), 12% (6) Silver Russell syndrome (SRS), 2% (1) Temple syndrome (TS), 2% (1) pseudohypopa rathyroidism Ib (PHP Ib) and 2% (1) transient neonatal diabetes mellitus (TNDM). No cases of Kagami Ogata syndrome have been found. The age of diagnosis varied between 0.03 and 83 years. All cases of TS, PHP Ib, TNDM and the most cases of SRS and BWS were diagnosed in the last 4 years due to new diagnostic tests.

We report here methods to correct KDM5C fault by testing epi drugs and RNA based technology to target KDM5C H3K4me3 axis. To this end, we used neuronally differentiated Arx KO/Kdm5c depleted ES cells, which show GA BAergic abnormalities in association with a global increase of H3K4me3 signal. We have undertaken an in vitro analysis of a number chromatin com pounds aiming of modifying the accessibility of the KDM5C transcription machinery.

We selec ted subtype specific LMRs using whole bisulfitome data available at TCGA. Differentially methylated regions (DMRs) within the BC subtype specific LMRs were selected by comparing tumors and normal tissues in a larger TCGA cohort assessed by Illumina 450K arrays. Finally, we performed TF en richment analyses in the identified DMRs and calculated PearsonÃ¢ÂÂs correla tions between the methylation levels of the loci presenting subtype specific TF motifs and the expression of the nearest genes.

Here, we hypothesized the MPB risk variant rs3856551 causes an allele specific difference in the bin ding affinity of EBF1 to its target site at 2q35 that result in the observed differences in WNT10A mRNA expression.

BackgroundDNA epigenetic modifications, such as methylation, are important regu lators of tissue differentiation, contributing to processes of both develop ment and cancer. Profiling the tissue specific DNA methylome patterns will provide novel insights into normal and pathogenic mechanisms, as well as help in future epigenetic therapies. In this study, 17 somatic tissues from four autopsied humans were subjected to functional genome analysis using IlluminaÃ¢ÂÂs Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChips that cover above 486,000 CpG sites. ResultsOnly 2% of the CpGs analyzed are hypermethylated in all 17 tissue speci mens; these permanently methylated CpG sites are located predominantly in gene body regions. In contrast, 15% of the CpGs are hypomethylated in all specimens and are primarily located in regions proximal to transcription start sites. A vast number of tissue specific differentially methylated regions are identified and considered likely mediators of tissue specific gene regu latory mechanisms since the hypomethylated regions are closely related to known functions of the corresponding tissue. Finally, a clear inverse corre lation is observed between promoter methylation within CpG islands and gene expression data obtained from publicly available databases. ConclusionsThis genome wide methylation profiling study identified tissue specific differentially methylated regions in 17 human somatic tissues. Many of the genes corresponding to these differentially methylated regions contribute to tissue specific functions. Future studies may use these data as a reference to identify markers of perturbed differentiation and disease related patho genic mechanisms.

We identified 29 deregulated microRNAs in more than 50% of patients (15 overexpressed, 14 underexpressed) with different deregulation profiles depending on their age and passage in vitro. We iden tified 4 interesting potential targeted pathways linked to aging/Progeria: cell cycle and proliferation, senescence, inflammation and autophagy for which 3 microRNAs target central actors of this pathway. No significant dif ference between patients and controls was detected for 3 autophagy makers on western blotting. However, using flow cytometry, allowing quantification of autophagy level cell by cell, we observed in a 14 yo patient exhibiting the most miRNA deregulated profile, a majority of cells having no autopha gy. Our hypothesis is that the overexpression of the 3 autophagy inhibitor miRNAs act as a Ã¢ÂÂbrakeÃ¢ÂÂ on autophagy, leading to a decrease of progerin degradation, and finally to a pathophysiological vicious cycle.

Materials and Methods: Methylome analysis using the 450K array was per formed using leukocyte DNA of 10 myelomeningocele (MMC) patients and 6 controls. A case control validation study with the Sequenom Epityper ana lyzed selected candidate loci with altered methylation in larger cohorts (83 MMC and 30 controls). Gene overexpression studies and phenotype analysis in a zebrafish model of neural tube formation are ongoing. Results: First, analysis of methylome data using a candidate pathway ap proach identified HOXB7 as risk factor for NTDs. Interestingly, HOXB7 hy pomethylation was confirmed in the validation study and HOXB7 overex pression in zebrafish resulted in NTDs. Secondly, genome wide analysis of the methylome data showed significant hypomethylation of 7 candidate loci that could also be validated with the EpiTYPER. Third, gene prioritization analysis based on functional protein associations, discovered interesting candidate loci. Conclusions: Our data implicate DNA hypomethylation as risk factor for NTDs with at least 8 novel candidate genes underlying NTDs.",2015
24267,"Background: Epigenetic mechanisms such as DNA methylation at the 5 car bon of cytosine (5 mC) were shown to have tissue specific patterns and play a role in post transcriptional regulation of gene expression. While 5 mC is well studied, the discovery of a stable intermediate during DNA de methyla tion (5 hydroxymethylcytosin (5 hmC)) raises questions about its function and distribution. The aim of this study was to test whether 5 hmC exists in human subcutaneous (SAT) and visceral adipose tissue (VAT) and correlates with anthropometric and metabolic parameters. ABSTRACTS POSTERS ESHG 2015 | GLASGOW, SCOTLAND, UK | WWW. ESHG. ORG 327Back to inde x Materials and methods: We used a sample set of 81 subjects (42 women and 39 men) to measure the % 5 hmC content in both SAT and VAT by using ELI SA technology. To test for associations with anthropometric and metabolic parameters we used paired students t tests, bivariate correlation analyses and linear regression models. Results: We observed an average 5 hmC content of 0.47 % ÃÂ± 0.093 in SAT , while VAT (0.51% ÃÂ± 0.122) is significantly higher hydroxymethylated (P , 0.005). In the total cohort we observed a positive association of % 5 hmC in VAT with age (P , 0.034). Furthermore, we identified a significantly negati ve relationship between % 5 hmC in VAT and LDL cholesterol levels which withstands adjustment for covariates and remains significant after correc tion for multiple testing (P , 0.008). Conclusion: Our data suggest adipose tissue depot specific 5 hmC levels with significantly higher levels in VAT .Grant References: DDG; DDS; IFB AdiposityDiseases; EFSD; BMBF; Compe tence network for Obesity; SFB1052/1",2015
24268,"Rho kinase (ROCK) has been well documented to play a key role in RhoA in duced actin remodeling. ROCK activation results in Myosin light chain (MLC) phosphorylation either by direct action on MLC kinase (MLCK) or by inhi bition of MLC phosphatase (MLCP), modulating actin myosin contraction. We found that inhibition of the ROCK pathway in induced pluripotent stem cells, leads to nuclear export of HDAC7 and transcriptional activation of the orphan nuclear receptor NR4A1 while in cells with constitutive ROCK hy peractivity due to loss of function of the RhoGTPase activating protein Oligo phrenin 1 (OPHN1), the orphan nuclear receptor NR4A1 is downregulated.

24269,"Platelet Endothelial Aggregation Receptor 1 (PEAR1) is a cell cell contact protein mainly expressed in platelets and endothelial cells. A common ge netic variant in PEAR1 (rs12041331) influenced platelet aggregation in aspirin treated high risk CVD patients. Reduced PEAR1 expression and de creased blood platelet function have been associated with the minor A allele of this SNP (G>A) that is located in intron 1 of PEAR1. We aimed to unravel the mechanism by which this non coding SNP leads to changes in PEAR1 expression. Luciferase assays in HEK293 cells transfected with the pGL3 promoter vec tor showed that the intronic region containing the G allele possesses signi ficantly higher transcriptional activity compared to the A allele (p<0.05). The G allele induces a potential CpG unit in this intronic region that can be methylated. Bisulfite sequencing of rs12041331 in leukocyte DNA samples from 10 G/G healthy individuals showed that the cytosine at this position is indeed fully methylated. EMSA experiments showed that the rs12041331 region (chr1:156869698 156869731) containing the methylated G allele strongly interacts with EAHY926 endothelial cells nuclear proteins compa red to the presence of the non methylated G allele or the A allele. ChIP experiments using DNA from EAHY926 endothelial cells and CHRF megakaryocytic (platelet progenitor) cells showed a significant enrichment of the active enhancer specific histone mark H3K4me1 for the rs12041331 region. In conclusion, we have found evidence that the rs12041331 SNP containing intronic PEAR1 region functions as transcriptional enhancer. Moreover, the methylated G allele is associated with increased enhancer activity, which could explain the association of this SNP with changes in platelet reactivity important for CVD.",2015
24270,Transcriptome analysis by next generation sequencing (RNA seq) allows a deep investigation of RNA expression and could be a powerful approach to identify networks of genes that play a role in disease. We investigate the transcriptome using HiSeq 2500 platform (Illumina) followed by differen tial gene expression analysis of samples derived from two patients affected by BloomÃ¢ÂÂs syndrome and three unaffected controls. The raw data were pro cessed and analyzed using two different methodologies: Bowtie2 and EdgeR programs with filtering and the Rsubread and DESeq2 programs without filtering. The genes found differentially expressed underwent a functional enrichment analysis by DAVID. The analysis showed a highly complex tran scriptional setting with upregulated differentially expressed genes asso ciated to activation and regulation of immune pathways. Our results suggest that immune responses can be most active in these patients in order to com pensate for a probable post transcriptional imbalance leading to genomic instability in patients with BloomÃ¢ÂÂs Syndrome.

Systemic Sclerosis (SSc) is a complex autoimmune disease of unknown etio logy. The SSc is characterized by vascular dysfunction and excessive accu mulation of extracellular matrix, resulting in progressive fibrosis leading to the failure of the affected organs. Previous studies identified specific dere gulation of miRNAs involved in autoimmune, vascular or fibrotic processes in skin samples from patients with SSc. Moreover, a specific miRNA profile is expected to be found also in blood samples from SSc patients that might be useful as biomarkers for diagnosis prognosis or disease severity. We obtained the transcriptional profiling of 17 PBMC from SS patients and 10 control samples using the methodology of massive sequencing of miRNAs by the small RNA Seq Illumina technology. Illumina sequencing unaligned reads data were aligned to the human subset of miRBase21 with novoalign (novocraftv3). Known miRNAs had a broad range of expression level. There were aprox. 330 mature miRNAs with more than 10 sequence reads and 32 miRNAs with more than 10.000 sequence reads. Differential expression ana lysis revealed 17 miRNAs significantly different between peripheral blood samples from SSc patients comparing to controls. 12 of them were found downregulated in SSc samples. Among these miRNAs, we detected miR 29a, miR 29b, miR 150, let 7g, miR 145, and miR 31 which were also found de regulated in the skin of patients with SSc. Other miRNAs not yet associated with the disease were also found. Analysis of blood cells miRNA expression may be useful to characterize the differential expression affecting immune cells, and to identify novel differentially expressed miRNAs associated with SSc.

ESHG. ORG 328Back to inde x genes. Approximately 10 % of known genes code for TFs, and with the FAN TOM5 project TF expression profiles have been firmly linked to gene expres sion profiles in multiple tissues and cell types. Studies indicate that common variants have low likelihood of falling within transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs), indicating purifying selection. Though tools like FunSeq2 have been developed that can predict breaking or conserving effects of variants on TFBSs, the genome wide impact of known variants on TFBS activity re main largely unexplored. Materials and Methods: A high quality catalogue of human variation obtai ned by sequencing, including more than 80 million variants, from 2504 in dividuals and 26 populations, available from the 1000genomes project were used for the analysis. Characteristics of genetic variants and their effects of TF binding scores, calculated using position weight matrices, were annota ted using a custom script interacting with the ENSEMBL database. Results: We defined different classes of genetic variants, based on their im pact on binding scores, and identify the most functionally relevant category, by performing enrichment analyses with variant sets from genome wide association studies and different categories of diseases. Discussion: Our work provides a more comprehensive genome wide picture of the impact of genetic variation on TFBSs. The identification of rare vari ants, more likely to play a role in different pathologies, through the activity of TFs, will help better annotation and understanding of the results of future sequencing studies.",2015

We studied the effects of UVB on the whole blood transcrip tome at different time points after exposure. Material and Methods: Nine Caucasian males with skin type II and mean age 25 years were exposed to sub erythemal UVB [whole body exposure of 2.5 standard erythema doses (SED)]. Blood samples were collected in PAXGe ne tubes before exposure (0h) and after 6h, 24h and 48h of exposure. RNA was extracted and mRNA libraries were prepared with the Illumina TruSeq mRNA Sample Preparation kit and sequenced in a HiSeq2000 equipment (100 nt, single reads).Results: An average of 17.3 M reads per sample (SD: 4.6, min: 9.8M, max: 28.7M) were mapped on the human genome and approximately 22% of them represented globin genes. At 6h post exposure, 9 downregulated and 1 upregulated gene were detected at a False Discovery Rate (FDR) of 5%. The most relevant genes are: FLT3, a class III tyrosine kinase regulating hemato poiesis and involved in acute myeloid and lymphoblastic leukemia; CPM, a carboxypeptidase that participates in monocyte and macrophage differen tiation; and FKBP5, a member of the immunophilin family, which plays a role in immunoregulation. No significant changes were identified at 24h or 48h, indicating a short lived acute effect. Conclusions: Exposure to UVB decreases expression of genes involved in im munoregulation in blood at 6h post exposure.",2015
24274,"Background: We conducted admixture analyses of metabolic syndrome in the Baependi family study from the state of Minas Gerais, Brazil to better un derstand the basis of ethnic differences in the metabolic syndrome. Methods: The Baependi family study consists of 80 families and 1,109 subjects with complete clinical information and genotype data from Affymetrix 6.0 SNP chip. Genome wide admixture analysis was performed to test whether local ancestry in this data was associated with any of the phenotypes in the me tabolic syndrome using a mixed linear model adjusted for age, sex, principal components 1 and 2 and taking into account the family structure. Results: Admixture analysis was performed using PCAdmix, a principal components based algorithm for determining ancestry along each chromosome from a high density genome wide set of phased single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotypes of admixed individuals. It returns a local ancestry estimate for haplotypes for each reference population. We used HapMap Phase 3 CEU and YRI samples and the HGDP Native American (NA) samples as the refe rence for PCAdmix. We observed an average local ancestry to be 0.69/ 0.13/ 0.18 across the genome for CEU/ YRI/ NA, respectively. We observed a peak on chr2p due to African ancestry for systolic blood pressure, on chr3 due to Native American ancestry for diastolic blood pressure, and on chrs 2q an d5q due to African ancestry for truncal obesity. Conclusions: In summary, by performing association analysis using local ancestry help to understand the ethnic differences in phenotypes related to the metabolic syndrome better than the standard association analysis.",2015

To further expand our knowledge of the genetic ar chitecture of the disease, we pursued a candidate gene approach assessing 25 genes and a total of 109 variants. Of these, synonymous single nucleoti de polymorphism (SNP) rs17810398 located in DAPL1 (death associated protein like 1) was found to be associated with AMD in a joint analysis of 3,229 cases and 2,835 controls from five studies (combined P , 1.15ÃÂ10 6, OR,1.332 [1.187 1.496]). This association was characterised by a highly significant sex difference (Pdiff , 0.0032) in that it was clearly confined to females with genome wide significance (PADJ , 2.62ÃÂ10 8, OR , 1.541 [1.324 1.796]; males: PADJ , 0.382, OR , 1.084 [0.905 1.298]). By targeted resequencing of risk and non risk associated haplotypes in the DAPL1 locus, we identified additional potentially functional risk variants, namely a com mon 897bp deletion and a SNP predicted to affect a putative binding site of an exonic splicing enhancer. We show that the risk haplotype correlates with a reduced retinal transcript level of two, less frequent, non canoncical DAPL1 isoforms. DAPL1 plays a role in epithelial differentiation and may be involved in apoptotic processes thereby suggesting a possible novel pa thway in AMD pathogenesis.",2015
24276,"The human amylase gene cluster is a highly copy number variable re gion. Salivary amylase (AMY1) copy number variation (CNV) has been correlated with the protein level, and high AMY1 copy number appears to result from adaptation to a high starch diet[1]. Additionally, AMY1 CNV has also recently been associated with body mass index (BMI)[2]. In the present study, we developed two PCR ratio assays to explore the pancreatic amylase (AMY2) variation, and a paralogue ratio test (PRT) for measuring AMY1 copy number. Combining our results with pre vious PRTs and read depth analysis, we observed variation in the AMY2 genes in the form of deletion or duplication of AMY2A and duplication of AMY2A/AMY2B. The frequency of these variations was different bet ween the studied populations, in most of which AMY2 CNV showed as sociations with AMY1 copy number. The AMY2 genes exhibit less exten sive variation than the salivary amylase genes; most individuals have two copies of AMY2A and AMY2B. However, segregation analysis in Afri can family trios revealed new arrangements of the pancreatic amylase genes. Some haplotypes harbour higher order duplication of AMY2A/ AMY2B, extending to quintuplication of AMY2A/AMY2B. Furthermore, our results suggest that the PRT we developed is a simple, accurate and high throughput method for measuring AMY1 copy number in a large set of samples. References: 1.Perry, G.

Many genes contributing to asthma heritability remain undiscovered be sides the firm susceptibility genes exposed to date. Most genome wide association studies (GWAS) for the trait have been performed in northern European populations and have analyzed the genetic variation provided by HapMap. As genetic risks varies among populations, here we have perfor med a three stage GWAS with unrelated Spanish subjects, which harbors 4 20% North African admixture. By leveraging the information provided by The 1000 Genomes Project, we analyzed ~6.5 million common variants (MAF>5%, Rsq>0.3) in 380 asthma cases and 552 population based con trols, using the Axiom Genome Wide CEU array (Affymetrix). We performed a prioritization of 18 loci associated at suggestive significance (pÃ¢ÂÂ¤5x10 5) that were followed up in a second sample of 482 cases and 1209 controls and a third sample of 346 cases and 137 controls, genotyped using iPLEX Gold assays (Sequenom). Two loci (2q33.2, 3p14.1) were nominally associated in the second sample, while only 3p14.1 achieved nominal significance in the third sample as well. A fixed effects meta analysis of the 3,106 individuals confirmed the association of 3p14.1 with asthma (OR,0.49, 95% CI,0.38 0.64, p,1.28x10 7).

The mutational dearth in ASD genes was particularly eminent when considering only SNVs with functional consequences, a possible effect of negative selection. Inte restingly, ASD genes also showed signs of positive selection, but these were less evident (P<0.09). We used these genomic characteristics to generate a multivariate model that classified ASD from non ASD genes with 72% ac curacy. These finding suggest that ASD genes have a unique evolutionary signature that could be used to identify new candidate genes for this con dition.",2015
24279,"Identifying susceptibility variants for multifactorial human traits can be complicated depending on the understanding of the genetic background on which it arises. This is especially difficult in small, under studied populations without readily available control cohorts.

We pre sent an investigation of biliary atresia (BA), a usually sporadic malformation of the biliary tree.

In this paper we explore the genetic association for case control design that draw the inference of the equality of the genotype frequencies in case and control and thus introducing an enhanced version of Cochran Armitage trend test. Materials and Methods: simulation studies have been applied to demon strate the validity of the proposed methods for the inference of trend test.

The proposed methods are simultaneously based on the same simulated data in order to provide a meaningful comparison of various algorithms. The simulations are done based on the 5000 iterations. In order to make a comparative evaluation of the procedures, we seek the certain desirable features such as the actual significance level. Results: Both simulation studies and real data studies have been used to validate the theoretical results. The QQplot of the p value of the proposed tests shows that the p value using the introduced method fits more with the uniform distribution that admits this method can be nominated to draw the inference.

The initial genome wide dataset provided information for only 36 SNPs from the 17q21 locus. We substantially increased the number of genotyped (n,68) and analyzed (n,156, 88 imputed) polymorphisms for their relati on with asthma. Eighty five of them showed disease associations (58 with p<10 5). The major signals derive from five distinct tagging bins comprising GSDMB GSDMA region, with rs8079416 being the top hit (p,6.08*10 8). Association data was also available for variants of the recently validated LRRC3C . Polymorphisms (rs12603332, rs4795405 and rs8079416) located in a cluster, representing three highest association peaks, influence ORMDL3 and GSDMA levels in PBMC [non stimulated and cells, stimulated with aller gens (PHA, Derp1, LpA and Ppg)] in an allele specific manner. Multiple 17q21 childhood asthma signals exist. The major peaks originate from the GSDMB ORMDL3 LRRC3C GSDMA region, suggesting that these ge nes could functionally underlie those associations.",2015
24285,"Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a major problem worldwide, leading to end stage renal disease (ESRD), with associated cardiovascular disease and pre mature mortality. UMOD encodes uromodulin (Tamm Horsfall glycoprotein) which is protective against kidney disease and is associated with Mendelian and multi factorial CKD. Using www.ampliseq.com we designed a next generation sequencing panel to comprehensively sequence 23,928 bp extending ~2 kb up and down stream of UMOD on chromosome 16p12.3. There is 96.4% coverage of the entire region with 100% coverage of exons using 89 amplicons (125 375 bp) sequenced on an Ion Torrent Personal Genome Machine (PGM TM) gene rating >900M aligned bases per 318 chip. Linkage disequilibrium was esta blished for identified SNPs and common tag SNPs genotyped in 2,000 indivi duals using a case control approach. A comprehensive literature review was conducted for UMOD to facilitate meta analysis for SNPs that were present in more than three studies with similar kidney phenotypes. Quantitative methylation data was available for 255 cases with CKD com pared to 152 controls without kidney disease from three independent studies. Following stringent quality control, and adjustment for multiple testing, five CpG sites were associated in UMOD, with subgroup analysis for diabetic nephropathy revealing cg03140788 as the most significant with P,0.00000000037. We also considered UMODL1 and overlapping UM ODL1 AS1 , revealing twenty four associated CpG sites, with P max,2.9x10 32 (cg16624482) for non diabetic ESRD. We have developed a cost effective approach for genotyping individuals or larger population based cohorts using 20 ng of input DNA. Genes were cha racterised for SNPs and CpG sites.

Introduction: Chronic periodontitis (CP) is a multifactorial disease. The TGFb, IL6 and SELL gene polymorphisms may be involved in the aetiology of CP . The aim of this study was to analyze the association between chronic periodontitis and TGFb C 509T , IL6 G 174C and SELL C605T genetic poly morphisms in the Romanian population. Materials and Methods: A total of 330 unrelated individuals, with at least 20 teeth in the oral cavity, were enrolled in the study. One hundred sixty five chronic periodontitis patients and 165 healthy controls were selected. The subjects were 44ÃÂ±3.8 (34 60) years old. Control subjects had no evi dence of clinical attachment loss and they were age and gender matched with patients. The diagnosis of CP was made on the basis of standardized cli nical criteria. The polymorphisms were genotyped using polymerase chain reaction based methods. Results: The distribution of the investigated polymorphisms in both groups was in Hardy Weinberg equilibrium. When the polymorphisms were con sidered independently, only the TGFb C 509T was associated with CP (p<0.05). Additional factors seem to influence this association. The risk for CP was also increases by the association between TGFb and gender (risk was higher in women) or SELL 605T variant (p,0.001) and by the presence of IL6 174C variant in smokers (p,0.05).Conclusion: TGFb considered individually, or in association with gender and SELL 605T or IL6 174C variants in smokers, was associated with CP in the Romanian population.

24288,"Island Southeast Asia (ISEA) is still one of the less genetically characterized region in the world, and it is often absent from ancestry studies of the Pacific even though it is a key location for understanding the population history of that region. Recent genetic studies suggest that the simplistic and most widely accepted model of an Australo Melanesian first settlement ~60 ka followed by an Austronesian expansion around 4.5 ka does not fully captu re the complexity of ISEA demographic history. To clarify the main disper sal routes and their impact in ISEA population prehistory, we performed a comprehensive study with a total of 114 newly complete mtDNA genomes affiliated in haplogroups previously associated with several demographic events in SEA. The most parsimonious phylogenetic trees were reconstruc ted including all published data. The statistical analyses included ÃÂ stati stics and maximum likelihood (ML) to estimate the coalescence times of clades, and Bayesian methods to evaluate changes in effective population size through time. Our results show two main demographic events contri buting to the gene pool of ISEA populations. One was the result of climatic changes and subsequent landscape alterations which lead to the postglacial dispersal of mtDNA lineages N9a6a, R9ab1a1a, B4c1b2a2, B5b1c, F3b1 and possibly R9c1a from both Mainland and ISEA, representing the major signal in ISEA.

24289,"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a relatively common lung disease in Sweden with severe impact on health and quality of life. Smoking is an important risk factor. Not all smokers develop COPD and non smokers can be in elevated risk for COPD, suggesting genetic factors modulating life time risk. Today, little is known about the impact of genetic variation on COPD susceptibility, progress and severity. Our aim is to investigate candidate genes, with emphasis on those important for lung development, for single nucleotide variants (SNVs) predisposing to COPD. We captured and sequenced 22 genes implicated in lung development and 71 genes and regions previously associated with COPD. Subjects with COPD and controls without COPD were retrieved from the Swedish Obstructive Lung Disease in Norrbotten (OLIN) sample. Both groups were matched for age, gender, weight and height, and contain the same number of smokers. We found 75 SNVs in significant association with COPD and all showed a strong effect size as either low or high odds ratios (0.2 8.1). These variants are mainly in genes that cluster in pathways associated with cell proliferati on, which includes genes in branching morphogenesis of the lung pathways involved in lung development and damage repair. Our results confirm previous findings but with higher effect sizes of asso ciated variants compared to similar studies, most likely attributable to the genetic background in our study population. These findings support the idea that genetic variants affecting lung developmental genes are important determinants of adult lung function.",2015

However, the functional contribution of CNVs to human health is still not well understood. The variability of gene ex pression is not explained by genetic diversity alone, therefore integration of systems level information, omics data, will provide a better understanding of human biology and disease etiology. To assess cis effects of common CNVs on gene expression and on complex phenotypes in the Finnish population based cohort DILGOM (N,510), we performed association analyses of CNVs to both the peripheral blood leu cocyte transcriptome and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy measured serum metabolome . We used linear regression to estimate the associations between 685 CNVs and expression levels of 37, 022 transcripts. A similar model was used for the serum metabolome, consisting of 31 lipid and lipoprotein related metabolite measures. After correction for multiple testing, 38 CNVs showed associations (p<2.28e 06) with gene expression levels and 14 of these CNVs showed further asso ciation (p<0.05) with metabolite levels. As an interesting example, a CNV in region 17q12 associated with SLFN13 and the ratio between apolipopro teins apoB and apoA1 in women (p,2.12e 04).

In recent years, several genomic regions have been robustly associated with CAD in different genome wide association studies mainly conducted on people of European descent. These kinds of data are lacking in African populations even though heart diseases are currently an important cause of premature death and disability. In this study, 384 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) located in four genomic regions associated with CAD (1p13, 1q41, 9p21 and 10q11) were analysed in a novel set of 274 case control samples from Morocco and Tu nisia with the aim of analyse for the first time if the associations found in European populations could be transferable also to North Africa. The results indicated that the variation in these four genetic regions had an important role for CAD predisposition also in North Africa. However, the in dividual SNPs associated with CAD in Africa were different from those iden tified in Europe in most cases (1p13, 1q41, and 9p21). In addition, signi ficant differences in the haplotype blocks and in the linkage disequilibrium patterns among North Africa and Europe were detected. The disparity in markers associated to CAD susceptibility between North Africa and Europe is probably due to the significant population differences found in the chromosomal architecture of these 4 CAD risk regions.

24293,"Depression is a prevalent psychiatric disorder with a strong genetic com ponent (40 50%). Efforts to uncover common genetic variation underlying depression have so far failed. Here we explored whether relatively large effect rare variants influence the risk of depression. To investigate high risk genetic variants associated with depression, we adopted a step wise approach. Within the Erasmus Rucphen Family (ERF) study, we identified families and individuals informative for the segregation of large effect rare variants using linkage and haplotype analyses with a sparse genome wide genotyping array. We then used exome sequence data of these individuals and the filtering approach to identify potentially high risk variants. Next we associated the identified variants with depressive symptomsin the ERF study (N,1,327). Finally, we replicated the findings in the po pulation based Rotterdam study (RS, N,2,356). We identified a missense C>T variant on chromosome 9p24 shared by affected haplotype carriers in the family. The variant was conserved and characterized as a damaging variant. The frequency of this variant was increased ~10 times (1.4%) in ERF compared to the general population (1000Genomes,0.16%). Carriers (N,51) were distributed across 5 generations. Significant association was observed with depressive symptoms (p value,9*10 04) giving an increase of depressive symptoms by 2.47 per allele. The variant explained ~5% of the genetic variance of depressive symptoms in ERF. Significant association (p value,0.032) and a large effect (effect,3.60) was observed on depressive symptoms in RS (N(carriers),23). The gene harboring the C>T variant is a novel gene for depression.

In the present study we assessed the role of 30 such DNA polymor phisms in the onset of diabetes induced retinopathy (DR) development in Pakistani type 2 diabetic subjects. Materials and Methods: A total of 570 age and gender matched individuals that included diabetic retinopathy (177,99 non proliferative DR+78 proli ferative DR), diabetic non retinopathy (DNR; 193) and controls (200) were genetically screened for polymorphisms in ACE, PAI 1 , SDH , eNOS, PON1, GSTT1, GSTM1, GSTP, VEGF, RAGE, TNF ÃÂ±, ATF6, HSP70 , MTHFR and MMP9. The genotyping techniques included allele specific PCR, RFLP and Sanger sequencing. Statistical comparisons were carried out by gender and sub clinical class adjusted logistic regression analysis. Results: Out of thirty SNPs studied, significant associations (p<0.05) were observed for HSP70 with diabetes, DNR, DR and non proliferative DR; MTH FR (rs1801133) with DNR; SDH (rs2055858) with DR and proliferative DR, SDH rs3759890 and rs2055858 were also found to have synergistic role in disease development; VEGF (rs1570360) with proliferative DR; TNF ÃÂ± and GSTT1M0 with proliferative and non proliferative DR; ACE with non proli ferative DR.

24295,"Background: Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a serious public health concern re sulting in a number of macrovascular and microvascular complications. Dia betic retinopathy (DR) is an important microvascular complication and a leading cause of blindness worldwide. DR is a complex trait, dependant on number of factors (e.g. glycaemic exposure, blood pressure), and increasing evidence suggests that genetic variation may also influence the susceptibi lity to DR. Previously published genome wide association studies (GWAS) have identified loci underlying DR within the regions of 1q13 42, 2q31 47, 6q22 27 and 13q14 32. However, these loci have not been replicated yet and studies used different grading schemes which confound interpretation of results. We aimed to explore the data from the Edinburgh Type 2 Diabetes Study (ET2DS) to identify potential association of genetic variants with DR in T2D patients. Methods: A case control association study was performed in 299 diabetic cases with DR and 640 diabetic controls. Cases were characterised accor ding to Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) classification. Genotype data obtained by the Illumina MetaboChipÃÂ® array was used for association analysis using PLINK. We used logistic regression analysis adju sted for sex, duration of diabetes, systolic and diastolic blood pressure and glycosylated haemoglobin. Results: Despite being one the largest study of its kind to date in Caucasians, no significant associations between genetic variants and DR were found. Conclusions: Further studies with an increased sample size are needed to identify loci associated with DR. The identification of new loci will reveal a better understanding of the aetiology of DR and could help to identify envi ronmental factors contributing to the disease development.

The study population consisted of 42 cases of EVC identified between January 1990 and December 2012 in 34 European registries. The mean prevalence of EVC was 0.53 per 100 000 births. There were 25 (59.5%) terminations of pregnancy after prenatal diagnosis, 2 (4.7%) fetal deaths, and 15 (35.7%) live births. The most common anomaly was polydactyly (27; 87.1%). Congenital heart anomalies, mostly septal defects, were present in 20 (64.5%) cases. Most cases (85.7%) are suspected prenatally at 18.8ÃÂ±4.2 (range 12 33) gestational weeks.

We sought to evaluate SNPs and CpG sites in ELMO1, performing a meta analysis of independent studies and exploring relevant methylation quantitative trait loci (meQTLs).A comprehensive literature review conducted for ELMO1 facilitated meta analysis for SNPs that were present in greater than three studies with simi lar kidney phenotypes. The InfiniumÃÂ® methylation 450K BeadChip array (Illumina, Inc, USA) was used to analyse DNA methylation across the methy lome in 255 CKD cases and 152 controls without kidney disease.

Methods: Cases and controls were recruited through tertiary referral clinics at University Hospital Southampton. For all exomed patients, genomic DNA was extracted using the salting out method and the samples were exome sequenced at the Wellcome Trust Centre in Oxford. Data were aligned and tested for quality control by using the in house pipeline and customised scripts. Association testing was conducted between disease status and po pulation control using the SKAT O test. Results: 10 genes within the NOD2 pathway have been previously implica ted in IBD by GWAS. We observed mutations in 39 of 40 genes comprising this pathway. Despite the small sample size (143 cases and 88 controls), SKAT O test identified four genes associated with disease status (p<0.05). The evidence contributing to the association signal for these genes is prima rily driven by rare variants that would not have been assessed in GWAS. Conclusion: Within our small cohort SKAT O showed a significant excess of burden of mutation in 4 genes: association was significant for two known IBD genes (NOD2 and IL6) and for two previously unreported genes (BIRC2 and BIRC3). Burden of mutations suggests the possible implication of BIRC2 and BIRC3 in PIBD.",2015

Our registry in Porto (Portugal) has data on 2754 patients (678 families). Although mean AO is 35.3, an impor tant group of late onset cases (AOÃ¢ÂÂ¥50) has been diagnosed in more recent years. Our aim now was to study this group and its differences with early onset cases. Methods: Our analysis of 326 late onset cases (133 families) comprised gen der and also their transmitting parent. Descriptive analysis and StudentÃ¢ÂÂs t test were used. Results: Age at onset was 60.03 for men and 59.25 for women (NS), as op posed to the general sample where women had a later onset (37.6) than men (33.4). Familial aggregation of late onset cases is apparent, with some families having up to 11 late onset cases.

Familial amyloid polyneuropathy (FAP ATTRV30M) is an autosomal do minant systemic amyloidosis, due to a point mutation in the transthyretin (TTR) gene. Among Portuguese families, FAP shows a wide variation in age at onset (AO) [19 82 yrs] and is characterized by extracellular amyloid deposits of fibrillary TTR and degeneration of peripheral nerves. Extracel lular signal regulated kinases 1/2 (ERK1/2) increase activation in salivary glands and nerves. ERK1/2 kinases (MEK1/2) activation was also up regu lated in peripheral nerves, with phosphorylation of ERK1/2. Therefore, this may represent an early signalling cascade leading to cytotoxic effects of TTR aggregates, resulting in earlier onset. Our aim was to study four candidate genes in this pathway as genetic modi fiers of AO in Portuguese FAP ATTRV30M families. We collected a sample of 106 FAP families with 316 patients. We selected 37 tagging SNPs, genotyped by SNaPshot, sequencing and RFLP . Results were analyzed with the GeneMapperÃ¢ÂÂ¢ v.4.0 software.

ABSTRACTINTRODUCTION: GaucherÃÂ¼s Disease (GD) is caused by a ÃÂ² glucocerebrosidase (GCase) deficiency leading to the accumulation of glucocerebroside in the reticuloendothelial system. The prevalence of GD in Tabuleiro do Norte (TN) (1:4,000) is the highest in Brazil. The purpose of this study was to pre sent evidence of consanguinity and founder effect for the G377S mutation (c.1246G>A) among GD patients in TN based on enzyme, molecular and ge nealogical studies. METHODS: Between March 2009 and December 2010, 131 subjects at risk for GD (GC in dried blood Ã¢ÂÂ¤2.19 nmol/h/mL) and 5 con firmed GD patients from the same community were submitted to molecu lar analysis to characterize the genetic profile of the population. RESUL TS: Based on the enzymatic and molecular analysis, the subjects were classified into 3 categories: affected (n,5), carrier (n,20), and non carrier (n,111). All carriers were (G377S/wt). Affected subjects were homozygous (G377S/G377S).CONCLUSION: The identification of a single type of mutation in carriers and homozygotes from different generations, the history of the community and the genealogy study suggest that the high prevalence of GD in this populati on may be due to a combination of consanguinity and founder effect for the G377S mutation.

To compare these observed incidences to estimated worldwide incidences of FXS. METHOD:A retrospective clinical and lab database review of positive FXS cases, born between years 2000 2009 inclusive, in both ROI and in NI. Inclusion criteria: i) Birth place: ROI/NI, ii) Birth year: 2000 2009, iii) FXS confirmed on clinical examination, iv) Full mutation allele (>200 CGG re peats), v) molecular test performed 2000 2014.RESULTS:The observed incidence of FXS in males and females, in both the ROI and NI, is ~1:11,000 and ~1:40,000 50,000 respectively. The analysis rate of FXS in ROI and NI is 0.8% and 1.3% of live births respectively however the male: female analysis rate ratio in both ROI and NI was determined to be ~4: 1.CONCLUSIONS:The all Ireland study does not support the commonly held view that FXS is the most common single gene cause of inherited intellectual disability. This first report of the observed incidence of FXS in ROI/NI is approximately 2.5 3 times less than the estimated worldwide incidence in males and less for females. The low incidence in males is not due to under testing as the analy sis rates are comparable to international standards. The very low incidence in females is probably exaggerated by lower than expected female analysis rates in both ROI and NI which indicates a need for sex specific criteria to guide clinicians when testing for FXS.",2015
24306,"Glucose 6 phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) is the most common inherited human enzyme deficiency and estimated to affect more than 400 million people worldwide. G6PD deficiency is an X linked recessive hereditary con dition that causes destruction of red blood cells. Males are more affected than females and the condition is common in African, Mediterranean, and Asiatic populations (i.e. malaria endemic regions). In the Middle East, the prevalence estimate of G6PD deficiency is the second highest in the world at 6%, the first being Sub Saharan Africa. Saudi Arabia is one of the most affected countries where G6PD deficiency is considered an endemic and all previous studies have been conducted using biochemical analysis.

24307,"General cognitive ability is substantially heritable and is predictive of both social and health outcomes. Molecular genetic studies estimate that com mon SNPs tag around 30% of the phenotypic variation. Here, using 594,756 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) genotyped in a sample of 6,610 unrelated individuals, the genome wide heritability estimate was decom posed into biologically informative groups with the aim of showing where in the genome the greatest proportion of the polygenic signal lies. The results indicate that the amount of phenotypic variance captured by a chromosome is proportional to its length and that SNPs within genes explain a greater proportion of phenotypic variance than SNPs found outside of genes. A chromosome by chromosome analysis is also provided and for the first time the contribution of common SNPs found on the X chromosome is quantified. Together these results provide further evidence that general cognitive abi lity is a highly polygenic trait with significant contributions arising in both genic and intergenic regions but with a greater proportion of variation being tagged by SNPs in genes. This unequal distribution of the polygenic signal justifies the use of gene set analysis methodology to genome wide associa tion study data sets as well as indicates that methods aimed at exploring re gions between genes can also identify regions harbouring variants making significant contributions to general cognitive ability.

Using a new quantitative approach, we examined the association between the ACTN3 R577X and the ACE ID variants with a total of 527 best personal 100 , 200 , and 400 m times of 349 elite pure sprinters from Australia, Bra zil, Greece, Jamaica, Italy, Poland, Russia, Lithuania, Spain, and US. Genoty ping of the sprinters was performed using various methods of PCR. On average, male Caucasian sprinters with the ACTN3 577RR or the ACE DD genotype had faster best 200 m sprint time than their 577XX (21.19ÃÂ±0.53 vs. 21.86ÃÂ±0.54 sec, p,0.016) and ACE II (21.33ÃÂ±0.56 vs. 21.93ÃÂ±0.67 sec, p,0.004) counterparts, respectively. A trend towards a faster best 200 m was noted in the 577RR African sprinters compared to their 577RX coun terparts (20.44ÃÂ±0.63 vs. 21.05ÃÂ±0.73, p,0.07). Furthermore, both ACTN3 577RR and ACE DD sprintersÃ¢ÂÂ best personal times were closer to the world record than their 577XX and ACE II counterparts. In conclusion, the ACTN3 R577X polymorphism individually and in combination with the ACE ID po lymorphism influence 200 m performance time of elite sprinters, and it is unlikely that athletes with either ACTN3 577XX or ACE II genotypes will achieve the speeds required for victory in Olympic sprint events.",2015

Variants were called together with the SISU project and annotated using Essembl Variant Effect Predictor. We identified a total of 6978 LoF variants in the current sample. Nonsense SNPs were the most frequent variant category (n,3997). Splice site variants (n,2115), initiator codon variants (n, 483), and variants affecting the stop codon (n,383) were also observed. Homozygous or compound heterozygous LoF variants were detected in different 509 transcripts in 259 different autosomal genes. The variants were reviewed using various databases e.g., Ensembl, OMIM, GWAS catalog, Genecard, NCBI, the 1000 Genomes Project and GEUVADIS to identify potential causative variants that have impact on cardiovascular disorders and their risk factorsNext, our aim is to analyze the effects of the homozygous and compound heterozygous LoF variants on gene expression using RNA sequencing data from the +500 cohort and validate the positive signals in larger FINRISK co horts (n~40 000).",2015

The rationale of this study is to identify regulatory genetic polymorphisms that induce high levels of inflammatory molecules in PCs. Methods: Supernatant from non leukodepleted PCs was sampled from 150 PCs prepared for transfusion purpose. LuminexÃÂ® technique was performed for measuring levels of sCD62P , RANTES, sCD40L, IL8, IL1ÃÂ² and TNFÃÂ± (MIL LIPLEXÃÂ® MAP Kit Millipore). In parallel, Genomic DNA was extracted from every blood donor, after written consent, using FlexiGeneÃÂ® DNA kit (Qiagen, Paris, France).Candidate polymorphisms were chosen from the HGMDÃÂ® professional data base (http://www.hgmd.org/) and genotyped using Tetra primer ARMS PCR and RFLP PCR. All of them were involved in transcription regulation. Studied polymorphisms were as follow: rs6127 and rs6136 for SELP (CD62P gene); rs3092952 for CD40L; rs1126647 and rs4073 for IL 8; rs2280788 for RANTES; rs1799964 for TNFÃÂ± and rs1143627 for IL 1ÃÂ². Results: We studied the evolution of the amount accumulated during the storage of each inflammatory molecule, depending on the genotype. Levels of sCD62P and IL 1ÃÂ² were genotype associated (p,0.04 and p,0.015, re spectively). The G allele of rs6136 for SELP upregulated the concentration of sCD62P and the C allele of rs1143627 of IL 1ÃÂ² gene upregulated the con centration of IL 1ÃÂ². Conclusion: If confirmed in a larger study, we suggest using these polymor phisms to prioritize distribution of PCs in order to give products with lower concentration of inflammatory molecules. Exploring these polymorphisms could prevent adverse reactions for patients who previously developed transfusion inflammatory reactions. Grant references: EFS, Erasmus Mundus Al Idrisi",2015
24311,"Next generation sequencing has revolutionized the identification of genetic variants. To be useful in a clinical setting, we need to distinguish causal from genuine variants. One can easily collect convincing but statistically poor evi dence that supports the link between a variant and a disease, even if the variant has no true effect on the disease at all. The effect is even worse if a genetic diagnosis is independent of a current phenotype, as it is the case for the so called incidental findings. The genetic background has an influence on the pathogenicity of variants. Hence, we aim to assess the population specific patterns for disease causing variants and the clinical relevance of variants that differ between popula tions. We compared the distribution of reported disease causing variants in the publicly available 1000 Genomes dataset. Principal component analysis on all variants listed in HGMD, ClinVar and based on the ACMG guidelines demonstrates strong population structure. We find variants that are causal across all populations; presumably only disease causing in one population; and likely to be false positive. Our work highlights several aspects. To assess the functional impact of a va riant, we need to carefully match the ethnicity of the patient with the popu lation in which the variant is reported. This is, however, difficult in admixed populations. We need to carefully evaluate each variant even if reported as causal. How reliable is the pathogenicity flag of a rare variant that is com mon in another population? How can we assess the causality if no functional data is available?",2015

Hemophilia B, X linked recessive bleeding disorder, is caused by a wide ran ge of mutations in the F9 gene. It is characterized by deficiency in factor IX clotting activity. The disease is classified as severe, moderate or mild, and the phenotype severity is related to the type and position of the mutation in the F9 gene. During molecular characterization of hemophilia B in Macedonia six unique and unreported changes in the F9 gene were revealed, confirming the high heterogeneity of molecular defects leading to disease.

24317,"Introduction: In a recently published work, Bulik Sullivan et al. (Nature Ge netics, 2015) provide a methodological approach to differentiate between an inflation of test statistics in genome wide association studies resulting from a polygenic architecture and from cryptic relatedness. This makes it also possible to estimate the heritability from summary statistics without requiring genotype data. The approach of Bulik Sullivan et al. estimates LD Scores from a reference panel and utilizes these quantities as covariates in a weighted linear regres sion of the squared test statistics. Since the test statistics are not indepen dent of each other, a bootstrap method is applied to obtain robust standard errors. Material and Methods: Building on the same mean model, our objective is to incorporate more useful extern information into the estimation in order to improve the efficiency of the estimation. In particular, we divide the ge nomic region into blocks of moderate size. For these blocks, the correlation structure between test statistics can be approximated by LD information from reference panels. Our estimation procedure is based on generalized estimating equations (GEE). We use the LD information to set up the wor king correlation matrices for each block, whereas we do not require that nearby blocks are independent. Results: We show that the GEE related asymptotic results are still valid un der reasonable assumptions. It is important to note that the working corre lation matrices are not required to be exactly the true correlation matrices in order to obtain consistent estimates and correct standard errors. Conclusion: These results imply that our approach improves the heritability estimation framework.",2015

Historical records suggest that the Sherpa migrated from Eastern Tibet to the Solu Khumbu region of Nepal approximately 500 years ago. We set out to shed further light on the history of the Sherpa and other indigenous high altitude populations of the Himalayas through analysis of dense genomic data. Methods: We had access to dense genotype data for 115 Sherpa from eight Sherpa villages in the Khumbu region of Eastern Nepal. We also included 76 Nepalese individuals of seven different ethnicities and 91 individuals from two regions of Tibet; Lhasa and Yunnan. We complemented this dataset with 701 samples from neighbouring populations of the greater Himalayan regi on including individuals along the Silk Road; Kazakistan, Kirgykistan, Taji kistan and Uzbekistan, India, Pakistan and China. We conducted principal component, admixture and homozygosity analysis on this dataset. Discussion and Conclusion: Our results suggest the Sherpa are a remar kably isolated, homogenous high altitude population. We confirmed the presence of an ancestral component that appears specific to high altitude populations of the Himalayas and is enriched in the Nepalese Sherpa, with particularly high proportions identified in individuals from a specific Sher pa village in the Khumbu valley of Nepal. Other indigenous populations of Nepal show varying degrees of admixture between southern (Indian), nort hern (Han) and Himalayan ancestry.

24319,"Essential hypertension refers to hypertension with no known cause accoun ting for 90 95% of all hypertensive subjects and is a major risk factor for stroke, heart disease, and end stage renal disease. Hypertension is a polyge nic disease and as such is supposed to harbour several genetic defects as the causative agents, but so far only a few potential genes have been identified. The major reasons for this modest progress are the unresolved physiologi cally heterogeneity of the disease and the prevailing monogenic approach to identify genes of importance. The physiologically heterogeneity was resol ved by partition of the study population by combined latent class analysis and structural equation modelling into an ensemble of physiological more homogeneous subpopulations. Two gene interactions were evaluated by variance decomposition and a new weighted mutual information score. The latter analytical approach considerably reduced the number of significant interactions detected by variance decomposition.

24320,"Isolated populations have population genetic characteristics that can boost power in genetic association studies of complex traits. Leveraging these advantageous characteristics requires an understanding of their po pulation genetic parameters, such as effective population size, population split time and migration rate, which have shaped their sequence variation.

We find that all isolates are genetically close to their nearest general population, but have lower genetic diversity, longer LD blocks and a higher proportion of haploty pe matching within individuals (runs of homozygosity), as expected because of genetic drift. We investigate the contribution of different population ge netic parameters to these characteristics and construct an Ã¢ÂÂisolation indexÃ¢ÂÂ, which we show can also be calculated reliably from SNP genotype data. Po pulations with the highest isolation index scores have the greatest overall depletion of rare functional variants, but enrichment of relatively common ones; they also provide examples of positive selection with potential biologi cal relevance. On this basis, candidate isolated populations can be evaluated for their informativeness in association studies.",2015
24321,"Introduction: Hypertension is a major risk factor for cardiovascular di seases, stroke, and end stage renal disease. Hypertension has been ranked at the top ten leading causes of death in Matsu. The genetic contribution to blood pressure variation is estimated ranging from 30 50%. The KLOTHO gene was identified as an aging suppressor gene and can regulate oxidative stress as well as protect vascular endothelial function, thus attenuate the progression of hypertension. To investigate the role of KLOTHO gene poly morphisms on hypertension, we conducted a community based follow up study in the Matsu islands of Taiwan. Methods: From 2002 to 2009, 3707 subjects had participated in the Matsu Community Based Integrated Health Screening project. We included 1955 Chinese subjects with DNA sample available and selected 6 SNPs on the KLOTHO gene (rs1207568, rs571118, rs577912, rs3752472, rs564481 and rs650439) for genotyping. Results: We found the CT genotype carriers of rs564481 had a significantly higher risk of hypertension than CC carriers (OR , 1.40, 95% CI , 1.02 1.91) and the GGACTA carriers had a higher risk of hypertension than non car riers (OR , 1.68, 95% CI , 1.16 2.43). We also found that the TT genotype carriers of rs564481 will significantly increase both SBP and DBP than the CC carriers over the study period. Besides, the SBP of the GGACTA haplotype carriers were significantly increased by 1.85 mmHg compared with their counterparts (p , 0.022) during the follow up period. Conclusion: Our findings provide evidence that the KLOTHO gene may play an important role on hypertension in Chinese population resident in Mat su.",2015
24322,"Homozygous Loss of Function (HLOF) variants provide a valuable window on gene function in humans, as well as an inventory of the human genes that are not essential for survival and reproduction. All humans carry at least a few HLOF variants, but the exact number of inactivated genes that can be tolerated is currently unknown as are the phenotypic effects of losing func tion for most human genes. Here, we make use of 1,432 whole exome se quences from five European populations to expand the catalogue of known human HLOF mutations; after stringent filtering of variants in our dataset, we identify a total of 173 HLOF mutations, 76 (44%) of which have not been observed previously. We find that population isolates are particularly well suited to surveys of novel HLOF genes because individuals in such popu lations carry extensive runs of homozygosity, which we show are enriched for novel, rare HLOF variants. Further, we make use of extensive phenotypic data to show that most HLOFs, ascertained in population based samples, appear to have little detectable effect on the phenotype. On the contrary, we document several genes directly implicated in disease that seem to tolerate HLOF variants. Overall HLOF genes are enriched for olfactory receptor func tion and are expressed in testes more often than expected, consistent with reduced purifying selection and incipient pseudogenisation.",2015
24323,"The aim of this study is to screen, for the first time, the variation of the LIN28B gene in the whole Mediterranean region, through the analysis of the allele distribution of three single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), namely rs7759938, rs314277 and rs221639, in 24 populations. These SNPs have been recently related to the age at menarche, pubertal height growth, peri pubertal body mass index, levels of prenatal testosterone exposure and can cer survival. 1197 DNA samples were genotyped. The allele and haplotype frequencies were used to determine the relationships between populations, using also data from the 1000 Genomes Project for external comparisons. The genotype distributions and the population structure between popula tions and groups of populations were determined. The population results indicate a significant degree of variation (F ST,0.043, p<0.0001). Allele and haplotype frequencies show significant differences among populations. A hierarchical variance analysis is consistent with a main differentiation bet ween the populations on the two North and South coasts of the Mediterra nean. This difference is especially evident in the unexpected distribution of the SNP rs221639, which shows one of the highest F ST (11.5%, p<0.0001) values described so far in the Mediterranean region. The population diffe rentiation and the structuring of the genetic variance, in agreement with other previous studies, indicate that the SNPs studied are good tools for the study of human populations, even at a microgeographic level.

Polymorphisms in the LPL gene have been previously demonstrated in association with several lipid phenotypes; however, the findings have been inconsistent. Given that post prandial assessment of lipoprotein metabolism may provide a more physio logical perspective of disturbances in lipoprotein homeostasis compared to assessment in the fasting state, we have investigated the influence of three LPL polymorphisms (rs268, 291S; rs320, HindIII; rs328, S447) on postpran dial TAG, non esterified fatty acid (NEFA), glucose and insulin in 261 parti cipants using a sequential meal challenge consisting of a mixed breakfast (0 min; 49g fat) and lunch (330 min; 29g fat). Blood samples were taken at 60 min intervals until 480 min after the test breakfast. At baseline, LPL S477 allele carriers had higher TAG (P,0.05) and lower HDL C (P,0.02). Follo wing the sequential meal challenge, there was an association of LPL S447 polymorphism with postprandial TAG and glucose, where S477 allele carri ers had 12% and 8.4% higher TAG area under the curve (AUC) (P,0.04) and glucose AUC (P,0.006), respectively. In addition, a borderline association was observed between S477 and postprandial NEFA levels (P,0.05). With LPL 291N polymorphism, those who were homozygous for N allele had hig her fasting NEFA (P,0.038) and postprandial NEFA response (P,0.003). In conclusion, our data suggest that carriers of 291S and S447 polymorphisms have an abnormal postprandial response to sequential meal challenge and provide further in vivo evidence as to the functional nature of LPL polymor phisms.",2015

Purpose: This study aimed to characterise the mutation profile of MLH1 and MSH2 in Moroccan colorectal cancer cohort. This is the first study in Mo rocco screening the population of our colorectal cancer patients in order to identify the prevalence of the disease. Methods: From January 2010, 214 newly diagnosed colorectal cancer tu mors received immunohistochemical staining for MLH1 and MSH2. If any stain was absent, the medical genetics service were alerted for a genetic consultation, and a Sequencing of corresponding MMR genes (mlh1 and msh2) was performed using the sanger method. Results: There were 21 (9.8%) cases with abnormal immunohistochemical results. Genetics was able to contact 19 (90.4%) of these patients, only 16 (76.1%) of them made an appointment. All the cases underwent the gene tic testing of mlh1 and msh2 genes, wich was informative in four (25%) of the patients. The diagnosis of lynch syndrome were confirmed among two (0.9%) patients harbouring deleterious mutations, however, the other two cases were found to have mutations with uncertain significance. Conclusion: This study attempted to define the frequency of lynch syndrome among Moroccan population. The preliminary results of the study showed that 0.9% were found to carry germline mutations of the mlh1 msh2 genes.

Single nucleotide variants (SNVs) and small inser tions and deletions (Indels) were called using the Genome Analysis ToolkitÃ¢ÂÂs (GATK) HaplotypeCaller and after QC and filtering a final dataset of 2,628 individuals was created. We detected 258,702 SNVs and 15,230 Indels with >2 alleles. Approximately 70% of SNVs and 50% of Indels were found re ported in the ESP6500 database, with high concordance in minor allele fre quency (MAF) (correlation of 0.97 and 0.91, respectively). 475 novel SNVs with MAF>20% were identified, which have not been described in any pu blic database (1000G, ESP , GoNL & UK10K). Pathway analysis of these novel common SNVs showed significant enrichment for olfactory (p,1.4E 05) and taste transduction pathways (p,1.6E 03). As compared to the mean vari ant density of the genome (1 SNV in 448 nucleotides of coding sequence), we observed 18 enriched pathways among the 500 genes with the lowest SNV density, most of which were signaling or cancer pathways. Noticeably, MAPK1 (1 SNV in 1,400), PIK3CB (1 SNV in 1,305) and PIK3R1 (1 in 1,761) were involved in many pathways, suggesting key regulatory functions for these genes.

INTRODUCTION The medullary cystic kidney disease type II (MCKD2) is an autosomal do minant disorder characterized by early onset of hyperuricemia, decreased fractional renal urate excretion and progressive interstitial nephropathy lea ding to end stage renal disease. MCKD2 is caused by mutations in the UMOD gene, which encodes Uromodulin, a glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchored protein that is expressed in the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle and excreted in the urine. Over 90% of UMOD mutations are missense, and 62% alter a cysteine residue, implicating a role for protein misfolding in the di sease. In this study we investigated the presence of mutations in UMOD gene in four members of Italian family showing the phenotype of MCKD2.METHODS: Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood leukocytes by using the Wizard Genomic DNA Purification kit following the manufacturerÃ¢ÂÂs instructions. Mutation analysis of the UMOD gene was performed by poly merase chain reaction and direct sequencing. A mutant UMOD construct, containing the identify mutation was created by in vitro mutagenesis. Tran sient transfection studies were performed in human embryonic kidney cells. Expression was evaluated by reverse transcription polymerase chain reac tion (RT PCR), western blot and immunofluorescence. RESUL TS: Sequence analysis revealed a heterozygous missense variation (c.187T>C; p. Cys63Arg) in exon 3 that altered an evolutionary conserved residue in the UMOD. Functional studies showed that the mutant protein was retained in the endoplasmic reticulum and was not excreted to the cell medium, as opposed to the wild type protein. CONCLUSIONS: Collectively, our results suggested that the variant may be the causative mutation in this family.",2015

The common insertion/deletion polymorphism (I/D) in the gene for angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) was previously associated with obe sity, both in preschoolers, adolescents and adults. ACE I/D polymorphism might play a role in the development of the obesity and the hypertension, which are closely linked to cardiovascular risk factorsThe aim of this study was to investigate the associations of obesity and ACE polymorphisms in patients with overweight and obesity. We enrolled 80 consecutive patients and 100 healthy subjects in the study. Both the obe se cases and the normal weight controls underwent the identical subset of standardized examinations. ACE insertion (I)/deletion (D) genotype was determined by PCR. The most common genotype in the obesity group was ID, with a lower percentage of DD and II (46%, 38.9% and 15.10% respec tively). We did not find any difference between gender and genotypes in obese and control group. We found that 40% of children with moderate obe sity have ID genotypes, while II genotype was most frequent (34%) in the severe obese subgroup. Children carrying I allele had a higher risk of obesity than those with allele D compared with the control group (p<0.05). These data suggest that ACE gene polymorphisms may influence the development of weight gain.

Introduction: Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is an immune mediated, inflammato ry, demyelinating and neurodegenerative disease of the central nervous sy stem with a proven, yet not fully established heritability. The objective of this study is to investigate the genetic basis of familial MS in Turkish po pulation using a genome wide linkage analysis in 10 multiply affected MS families from Turkey. Materials and methods: Here we investigated linkage with MS across the genome using single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotyping on the Illumina CytoSNP 300K array in 35 individuals from 10 MS families. Non parametric linkage (NPL) scores were calculated for each of 3118 SNP mar kers spaced at an average of 1 cM intervals using SimWalk multipoint NPL analysis. Subsequent fine mapping of regions showing higher NPL scores was performed. Results: The 10 families in which one or more individuals had MS showed suggestive evidence of linkage (NPL scores above 1.7) to chromosomal re gions of 13q12.2 14.11 and 21q22.12 22.3. Fine mapping of these regions revealed that the most promising loci for linkage were mapped to 13q13.3 and 21q22.2, with NPL scores of 1.82 and 1.85, respectively. Inflammation or neurodegeneration associated genes some of which previously implica ted in MS including HMGB1, POSTN, OLIG1, IFNAR1, IFNAR2 genes and also promising novel genes yet to be identified like N4BP2L2 and TRPC4 were found within the suggestive regions. Conclusions: Although there was no significant evidence for linkage, our suggestive linkage results provide a framework for deep sequencing to iden tify new susceptibility genes and novel variants associated with risk of MS.",2015
24332,"The Armenians are a culturally isolated population who historically inhabi ted a region in the Near East bounded by the Mediterranean and Black seas and the Caucasus, but remain underrepresented in genetic studies and have a complex history including a major geographic displacement during World War One. Here, we analyse genome wide variation in 173 Armenians and compare them to 78 other worldwide populations. We find that Armenians form a distinctive cluster linking the Near East, Europe, and the Caucasus. We show that Armenian diversity can be explained by several mixtures of Eurasian populations that occurred between ~3,000 and ~2,000 BCE, a pe riod characterized by major population migrations after the domestication of the horse, appearance of chariots, and the rise of advanced civilizations in the Near East. However, genetic signals of population mixture cease after ~1,200 BCE when Bronze Age civilizations in the Eastern Mediterranean world suddenly and violently collapsed. Armenians have since remained isolated and genetic structure within the population developed ~500 years ago when Armenia was divided between the Ottomans and the Safavid Em pire in Iran. Finally, we show that Armenians have higher genetic affinity to Neolithic Europeans than other present day Near Easterners, and that 29% of the Armenian ancestry may originate from an ancestral population best represented by Neolithic Europeans.

Nitric oxide (NO) is an impor tant physiological messenger synthesized by the three NOS isozymes, the neuronal NOS (NOS1), the inducible NOS (NOS2) and the endothelial NOS (NOS3). Potential genetic associations were assessed for different polymor phisms: 67 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP), 10 short tandem repeat polymorphisms (STRP) and 6 haplotypes on areas that showed high linka ge disequilibrium, on all three NOS genes. These analyses were performed in a total of 903 samples: 408 heart disease patients and 495 non affected, coming from two different sample designs, nuclear families (trios) and case control. The association analysis was implemented by using the LAMP soft ware which carries out the analysis combining case control and trio familiy samples. No haplotype significant association was found. The SNP results showed some significant associations, however when multiple testing correction (Bonferroni) was applied, all these associations became non significant. The STRP results showed 7 out the 10 polymorphisms analysed significantly as sociated to heart disease. After multiple testing corrections 5 of them still showed significant associations. Most significantly associated polymorphis ms were located on regulatory regions on the NOS1 and NOS2.In conclusion only the variability in NOS1 and NOS2 genes appears to be significantly associated to heart disease in the Spanish population.

We have developed an approach to discover and genotype these numts using paired end, next generation sequencing data and have previously described its application to human populations. Here, we extend our analysis to the whole genomes of 77 non human prima tes consisting of chimpanzees, bonobos, gorillas and orang utans.

We charac terized and where possible have assembled their underlying sequences, and further examined these variants for biases in sequence context at insertion sites and their potential for functional effects. In addition, we also examined the patterns and origin of these insertions and have estimated their age. We investigated whether there are species specific preferences for both poly morphic and fixed numt insertions and whether these are associated with the difference in the mutational load of numts observed between chimpan zees and the other species, including humans. To our knowledge, this is the first study to look at polymorphic numt insertions in non human primates and we believe this research will help clarify to what extent that numts play a role in hominoid diversification and phenotypic variability.",2015

Methods: The selected cohort for genotyping consisted of 64 subjects, 44 obese and 20 controls (33 adults, 23 children, 8 Prader Willi syndrome patients). The results were tested in correlation with obe sity parameters and associated disorders. Results: This is a first approach of genotyping in a Romanian cohort comprising adults and children for two genes related both to energy accumulation and expenditure. The FTO allele A was more associated with obesity in adults than in children (statistical for both). The FTO rs9939609 polymorphism is a common SNP in our stu dy group, its mutant A allele showing higher frequencies than worldwide. The ADRB3 polymorphism is a rare variant: its C allele proved correlations, some statistical, with obesity susceptibility, although no homozygous mu tant subjects were reported. The rs4994 frequency was higher in our groups than worldwide. ADRB3 indicated higher associations with obesity predis position in children.

While there is substantial variation in birth prevalence across populations, oral clefts demonstrate strong familial aggregation and relatives of affected indi viduals are at significantly increased risk compared to the general popula tion. Genome wide association studies have shown numerous genes (inclu ding IRF6, ABCA4 and MAF) and even regions with few or no known genes (such as 8q24) play an important role in the etiology of oral clefts. However, much of the observed familial aggregation and heritability of oral clefts re mains unexplained. Large scale sequencing in extended multiplex families can help to define the relationship between disease and genetic variants too rare in the population to be detected through tests of association in conventional study designs.

To identify rare variants in longitudinal family studies, we extend the powerful pedigree based burden and kernel association tests for genetic longitudinal studies. The proposed methods model phenotypes following a distribution in the exponential fa mily. Confounding factors as fixed effects can be adjusted for. These tests account for the complex correlations between repeated measures from the same phenotype (the serial correlation) and between individuals within the same family (the familial correlation). We use generalized estimating equa tion (GEE) approaches to generalize the pedigree based burden and kernel tests to multiple correlated phenotypes under generalized linear model fra mework. Comprehensive simulation studies were conducted to compare the proposed tests with marginal models using GEE and mixed effects models under a variety of configurations. The proposed tests are applied to the Dia betes Heart Study (DHS). Significant exome variants of POMGNT1 and JAK1 genes associated with type 2 diabetes are identified.",2015
24342,"When analyzing a case groups of patients with ultra rare disorders the eth nicities are often diverse and the data quality might vary. The population substructure in the case group as well as the heterogeneous data quality can cause substantial inflation of test statistics and result in spurious associati ons in case control studies if not properly adjusted for. Existing techniques to correct for confounding effects were especially developed for common variants and are not applicable to rare variants. We therefore analyzed dif ferent strategies to select suitable controls for cases that originate from dif ferent populations and differ in data quality. We developed an approach to build up a control group that is most similar to the individuals in the case group with respect to ethnicity and data quality by means of a metric that puts more weight on rare variants. We simulated different disease entities on real exome data and show that a similarity based selection schemes can help to reduce false positive associations and to optimize the performance of the statistical tests. We reanalyzed collections of unrelated patients with Kabuki make up syndrome, Hyperphosphatasia with Mental Retardation syndrome and Catel Manzke syndrome for which the disease genes were recently described. We show that rare variant association tests are more sensitive and specific in identifying the disease gene than intersection filters and should thus be considered as an favorable approach in analyzing even small patient cohorts.

24343,"Indroduction: Inflammatory cytokine cascades have been implicated in the pathogenesis of pregnancy loss. Polymorphisms in cytokine genes may af fect the risk of recurrent spontaneous abortions (RSA) but genetic associa tion studies have often contradictory results among different populations. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether polymorphisms in the interleukin genes IL 6 and IL 1 are implicated in pregnancy outcome. Methods: A total of 220 Greek women were examined for the IL 6 174 T/C and IL 1 Ra polymorphisms. The patient group consisted of 120 women with at least three unexplained recurrent spontaneous abortions before 20 weeks of gestation while 100 women with at least two live births and wit hout history of abortions served as controls. All individuals were genotyped by the PCR RFLP method, for the first polymorphism, and by PCR method for the second polymorphism. Results: The data between the two groups were analyzed by chi square test or FisherÃ¢ÂÂs exact test. Our results indicated that for both studied polymor phisms there are no significant differences in genotype or in allele frequen cies between the patient and the control group. Conclusion: Conversely to some other populations, in our Caucasian popu lation the polymorphisms IL 6 174 T/C and IL 1 Ra are not associated with the risk for RSA.",2015
24344,"Bone mineral density (BMD) is a highly heritable trait used both for the dia gnosis of osteoporosis in adults and to assess bone health in children. Ethnic differences in BMD have been documented, with markedly higher levels in individuals of African descent, which partially explain disparity in osteopo rosis risk across populations. To date, 63 independent genetic variants have been associated with BMD in adults of Northern European ancestry. Here, we demonstrate that 61 of these variants are predictive of BMD early in life by studying their compound effect within two multiethnic pediatric cohorts. Furthermore, we show that within these cohorts and across populations worldwide the frequency of those alleles associated with increased BMD is systematically elevated in individuals of Sub Saharan African ancestry. The amount of differentiation in the BMD genetic scores among Sub Saharan and non Sub Saharan populations and together with neutrality tests, sug gest that these allelic differences are compatible with the hypothesis of selective pressures acting on the genetic determinants of BMD, providing a new example of polygenic adaptation in a human trait.",2015
24345,"Introduction: The Slovenian territory, which is geographically positioned in central Europe between the Alps, the Adriatic Sea, Pannonian basin and Dinaric Mountains, has experienced turbulent historic events, which are reflected in different archaeological cultures found in the area. Turbulent historic events and diverse geography of the region have produced a diverse contemporary population whose genetic analysis could provide insight into past demographic events. Materials and Methods: In order to characterise the Slovenian mitochondrial gene pool at the micro geographic level and to compare it with surrounding populations we analyzed a total of 402 individuals from five Slovenian regi ons, by typing HVR I, HVR II and coding region polymorphisms of mtDNA. Results: Analysis revealed 47 haplogroups and subhaplogroups, the most common of which were H*, H1, J1c, T2 and U5a. The intra population com parison revealed a sharp gradient of J1c haplogroup between different Slovenian populations, with the peak frequency of 24.5 % in the population of Littoral Region. The high frequency of J1c haplogroup among the popu lation of Littoral Region could represent the genetic trace of the early Neo lithic expansion along the East Adriatic coastal region, which is in line with the archaeological horizon known as an Impressed Ware culture, whose fin dings are characteristic for Slovenian Littoral Region. Conclusion: These results outline not only the impact of early Neolithic ge netic input on a modern Slovenian genetic structure, but also an importance of regional sampling strategy for the understanding of historical demogra phic events which define the history of East Adriatic and Central European populations.",2015

After excluding cases with unspe cified NTD location, unknown maternal folic acid supplementation status, or a probable syndromal or chromosomal cause for the NTD, we had 173 cases in our study population. Methods: Chi square testing was used to assess differences in NTD subtype distribution between two groups: correct folic acid supplementation and incorrect or no folic acid supplementation. We then assessed whether ex posure to the main risk factors for NTD influenced the NTD subtype distri bution. Main Outcome Measures: The proportion of anencephaly, cervical/thoracic spina bifida, lumbar/sacral spina bifida, and encephalocele per folic acid group. Results: Proportionally fewer cervical/thoracic cases and more lumbar/sac ral spina bifida cases were present in the correct folic acid supplementation group than in the group with incorrect or no folic acid supplementation, and this was irrespective of the presence of the main NTD risk factors. The effect on NTD subtype distribution was only seen when folic acid supplementation was started before conception. Conclusions: Folic acid not only prevents the occurrence of a significant pro portion of NTDs, but might also decrease the severity of NTDs, as long as supplementation is started before conception.",2015
24347,"Structural Variants(SVs) are key elements in evolution and complex diseases. Their detection from high throughput sequencing(HTS) data has evolved substantially increasing its sensitivity to smaller events and breakpoints resolution. However the fraction of false positive predictions remains non negligible and few efforts have been directed toward problematic regions such as low mappability or repeat enriched genomic regions, known to be rich in SVs but generally excluded from analyses. After revealing important complex technical bias in HTS, we propose to use a large set of experiments and a population based approach to robustly identify of abnormal regions genome wide. Comparing read coverage across hundreds of samples requires an appro priate normalization step. We show that a general normalization is not suf ficient to correct systematic sample specific variation and develop a flexible and targeted approach. The statistical test for each bin uses a Z test like score adjusted by a robust multiple testing correction. We test our approach on more than 100 normal and tumor whole genome paired datasets from three different cancer resequencing projects. We show that more concor dant germline events and tumor specific ones are detected, compared to other approaches. Very few regions of the genome were excluded and a number of SVs were detected in low mappability region. The comprehen siveness and extended genomic coverage of the approach will benefit the characterization of variation in low mappability regions as well as cancer and disease related studies where complex SVs play an important role.",2015
24348,"It has been suggested that association of common variants with complex diseases can be created by multiple rarer variants. While the hypothetical properties of such synthetic associations have been elaborated, so far no method has been provided for the systematic retrieval of genetic variant sets that create a synthetic association. Variants giving rise to synthesis might be located several Mb away from the major association signal. Testing all pos sible combination of n nearby variants results in an exponential number of tests, 2^n 1. In view of this, the need for an efficient search strategy is ob vious. In this work, we define filter criteria based on linkage disequilibrium measures and allele frequencies which reflect expected properties of syn thesizing variant sets. From those we obtain potentially synthesizing sets and, by using the identified variants as covariate parameters in a regression model, subsequently evaluate whether they actually explain the main asso ciation signal.

Minor allele of CAPN10 SNP 43, 19 polymorphisms provide risk towards T2D in Brahmin and Jat Sikh groups; SNP 63 in Bania and Jat Sikh groups. G allele of PGC 1ÃÂ± Gly482Ser polymorphism was found to play protective role against T2D in Jat Sikh group (p,0.002). Intriguingly, it provided 1.48 fold increased risk towards T2D predisposition in Bania group (p,0.009) sugge sting population specific risk towards T2D.

Differential pattern of genetic association and haplotypes of stu died genes emphasized the role of ethnic heterogeneity in T2D. The inconsi stency of genetic effects of studied polymorphisms across populations from different ethnicities was investigated through meta analysis indicating the role of population stratification.

24350,"Introduction: Mean leukocyte telomere length (LTL) exhibits considerable interindividual variability and has high heritability estimated at 0.70 (95% CI 0.64 0.76). Both shorter and longer LTL have been shown to associate with age related diseases, including coronary artery disease (CAD) and some cancers. We previously reported seven loci associated with LTL. Using these in a genetic risk score analysis implies a causal link between shorter LTL and increased CAD risk. However, the extent to which the association of shorter LTL with other age related disorders is causal in nature remains unclear. Identifying additional genetic variants that affect LTL and testing their association with disease through mendelian randomisation approa ches could clarify any causal role. Materials and methods: We report preliminary results from a genome wide meta analysis of LTL in up to 44,708 individuals, from 21 cohorts, after im putation using the 1000 genomes reference panel. Results: We have redefined the lead signal for many of the known loci. Using an FDR of 1% in an additive model we identify ten novel loci affecting LTL. We also performed a recessive analysis which identified an additional 13 loci using an FDR of 5%. The novel loci includes both genes involved in telo mere biology (ATM, DCAF4, POT1) as well as genes with no known involve ment (MPHOSPH6, DCC).Conclusions: Imputation to a large reference panel and assessing both addi tive and recessive modes of inheritance has brought the total number of loci associated with telomere length to 30.Grants & fellowship: The ENGAGE Consortium was funded by the European Union.",2015
24351,"ESHG. ORG 347Back to inde x University of Cyprus, Nicosia, Cyprus. Familial glomerular hematuria(s) comprise a genetically heterogeneous group of conditions which include Alport Syndrome (AS) and thin basement membrane nephropathy (TBMN). Here we investigated 57 Greek Cypriot families presenting glomerular microscopic hematuria (GMH), with or without proteinuria or chronic kidney function decline, but excluded clas sical AS. We specifically searched the COL4A3/A4 genes and identified 8 heterozygous mutations in 16 families (28,1%). Eight non related families featured the founder mutation COL4A3 p.(G1334E). Renal biopsies from 8 patients showed TBMN and focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS). Ten patients (11.5%) reached end stage kidney disease (ESKD) at ages ranging from 37 69 yo (mean 50,1 yo). Next generation sequencing of the patients who progressed to ESKD failed to reveal a second mutation in any of the COL4A3/A4/A5 genes, supporting that true heterozygosity for COL4A3/ A4 mutations predisposes to CRF/ESKD. Although this could be viewed as a milder and late onset form of autosomal dominant AS, we had no evidence of ultrastructural features or extrarenal manifestations that would justify this diagnosis. Functional studies in cultured podocytes transfected with wild type or mutant COL4A3 chains showed retention of mutant collagens and differential activation of the unfolded protein response (UPR) cascade.

Genome wide association studies (GWASs) have identified several single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) influencing the risk of thyroid cancer (TC). Most cancer predisposition genes identified through GWASs function in a co dominant manner, and studies have not found evidence for recessive ly functioning disease loci in TC. Our study examines whether homozygosity is associated with an increased risk of TC and searches for novel recessively acting disease loci. Data from a previously conducted GWAS were used for the estimation of heritability, the detection of runs of homozygosity (ROH) and the determination of inbreeding to unravel the influence on TC. Asso ciation on a SNP by SNP basis reached genome wide significance at a level of P<10 8, with eight SNPs representing true differences in homozygosity between cases and controls. The rate of ROHs per person was significantly higher in cases than in controls. The average ROH size and length of ROHs per person was also higher for cases than controls. A total of 16 recurrent ROHs of rather short length were identified although their association was not significant at a genome wide level. Several recurrent ROHs harbor genes associated with risk of TC. All of the ROHs showed significant evidence for natural selection (iHS, Fst, Fay WuÃ¢ÂÂs H). The higher inbreeding among cases support the existence of recessive alleles that cause TC. Although regions of homozygosity were rather small, it might be possible that variants within these ROHs affect susceptibility to TC and may function in a recessive man ner.",2015

Such small communities can reflect large demographic processes that hap pened in human prehistory and history and give us insight into the ancient migratory paths and forming of the Croatian and Southeast European gene pool. The aim of this study was to evaluate the level of isolation of insular populations based on the observed haplogroup distribution and frequen cies of 720 samples from 12 Croatian subpopulations and to define the main processes that have shaped present Y chromosome variation of Eastern Adriatic islands and Croatia in general. A high level of haplogroup and ha plotype diversity has been detected in the overall sample and the observed haplogroup frequency distributions correspond to an average European po pulation, suggesting a dynamic gene flow in this region throughout history. The PCA plots show that the position of different Croatian subpopulations mostly corresponds to their actual geographic location.

24355,"Recently, a high number of Y chromosome SNPs has been discovered through next generation sequencing studies, but the geographic distributi on for most of these variants remains largely unexplored. Haplogroup E is the most common human Y chromosome clade within Afri ca and its internal branches have been linked to a wide range of human mo vements. To increase the level of resolution of haplogroup E, we disclosed the phylogenetic relationships among 729 mutations found in 33 haplo group DE Y chromosomes sequenced at high coverage in previous studies and further dissected the E M35 subclade by genotyping 62 informative markers in about 5000 samples from 118 worldwide populations. The phylogeny of haplogroup E showed novel features compared to the previous topology, including a new basal clade. Within haplogroup E M35, we resolved basal polytomies and assigned all the E M35* chromosomes to different new monophyletic clades. Through a Bayesian phylogeographic analysis, we associated each node of the tree to specific geographic areas. By this analysis, we identified a new E M35 sub Saharan clade, which origi nated about 11 kya in the northern part of the Horn of Africa. SNP based da ting, phylogenetic structuring and geographic distribution of this clade (and its sub clades) are consistent with a multi step dispersal of herders within eastern Africa and its subsequent diffusion to sub equatorial areas.

Using this dataset we created the world spatial distribution maps of 230 haplogroups. This World Atlas of Y chromosomal variation was created by GeneGeo software, which we developed for digital map analysis in gene geo graphy. The zones of sharp changes in frequencies were interpreted as ge netic boundaries; the main boundary crosses Eurasia and includes not only mountain (Himalayas and Caucasus) but also steppe segments. The question arises to which degree patterns of Y chromosomal variation agree with data on other genetic systems. To answer, we characterized all extant ethnic groups speaking Balto Slavic languages by mitochondrial DNA (N,6,876), Y chromosome (N,6,079) and genome wide SNPs (N,296). We found that genetic distances, based on autosomal and Y chromosomal loci, show a high correlation (0.9) both with each other and with geography but slightly lower correlation (0.7) with the mitochondrial DNA and linguistic affiliation. The high throughput sequencing of the Y chromosome reveals thousands phylogenetically informative SNPs. Population screening for these markers subdivides old haplogroups with subcontinental zones of spread into mul tiple young haplogroups with restricted areas thus providing excellent tools for reconstructing population history.

24357,"The scarcity of human remains in Corsica leads to uncertainties of its first peopling. First modern human might have arrived during Paleolithic, as great glaciations had form bridges between Toscana and Corso Sardinian Island, allowing humans to cross at different time in Pleistocene. Conflicting results have been published concerning the genetics of the Cor sican populations and their relationship with Sardinian, French and Tuscans populations. It appears obvious that Corsican populations display high he terogeneity, exacerbated between North and South; this is confirmed by anthropological, archeological and linguistic data. Moreover, continental hi storical genetic input could be modest, despite many historical campaigns. Thus, the genetic characteristics of the Corsican population could be the result of Neolithic or Paleolithic migrations. The objective of the present study is to get an insight of the Corsica peopling by the analysis of the Y chromosome. This study comprises data from po pulations from the Mediterranean zone, totaling 890 individuals. Samples were collected from 18 populations from Corsica, 1 from Provence and 3 from Toscana. All samples were type for the 19 main haplogroups and according to each sample genotype, further analyses were performed: 84 binary markers were genotyped and 53 were informative. Haplogroups profile in Corsica showed some signature from both France and Toscana, but mostly display its own specificity. The strongest genetic structure was encountered when the populations were considered into four main geographical groups: northwest, south and east, northern peninsula, and western region.

Following these interventions, referral and genetic counselling uptake rates were examined for all SOC cases at PM between 2010 and 2013. Of 430 SOC cases, 59% (253/430) were referred for genetic counselling and 54% (233/430) attended an appointment. Of those who received genetic coun seling, 94% (220/233) proceeded with genetic testing and 23% (50/220) harboured a BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation. Notably, 34% (17/50) of women with a mutation had no family history of breast or ovarian cancer. Despite changes to increase uptake of genetic counselling, a significant number of eligible women are still not receiving genetic testing. Considering the high mutation rate in this population and the value of such results in determining treatment and identifying high risk families, it is imperative that all women diagnosed with SOC are offered genetic testing, irrespective of family history or age at diagnosis.",2015

Breast cancer (BC) is the most common invasive cancer worldwide in women and it is also the leading cause of death from cancer amongst women. BC in young women is rare and only 5 7% occurs in women under 40 years. Nearly 5 10% of patients suffering from BC have genetic predisposition. Most of hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndromes are caused by a germline mutation in the BRCA genes. Genetic counseling allows to find sub jects with hereditary genetic predisposition to cancer, to implement preven tive measures reducing the incidence of these tumors and early diagnosis to improve survival. The aim of this study was to review the inclusion criteria of women with BC below 40. From the unit of genetic counseling of Castilla y Leon between 2003 2013, 206 women diagnosed with BC under 40 were included in this study. Genomic DNA was isolated from peripheral blood and BRCA1/2 co ding regions and intron exon boundaries were amplified by PCR and analy zed by Sanger sequencing. The prevalence of a BRCA1/2 germline pathogenic mutation was 22 (10,7%). From these patients 18,1% did not have familial history of breast/ovarian cancer. 72% of these mutations were found in BRCA1 where 75% of these carriers have familial history of breast/ovarian cancer. In relation to 184 non carriers patients, 81 women had positive familial history. Our results suggest that women below 40 without familial history should not be included for BRCA1/2 genetic studies although it is necessary to per form an economical analysis before take the definitive decision.

24366,"Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia type 1 (MEN1) and type 2 (MEN2) are auto somal dominant cancer syndromes that are associated with significant mor bidity and mortality. Early genetic testing and diagnosis of MEN1 and MEN2 can allow for medical care to improve cancer related outcomes. There is litt le research on communication with children about genetic testing for child hood cancers. This study explored parentsÃ¢ÂÂ experiences and perceptions of childrenÃ¢ÂÂs information needs for genetic testing for MEN1 and MEN2. Semi structured qualitative interviews were conducted with seventeen parents whose children had been tested for either of these cancer syndromes in the twelve months preceding the time of recruitment. The findings show that parents found it difficult to broach the subject of predictive genetic testing for cancer with their children, and many would have valued support to do so from healthcare professionals (HCPs). Parents also believed their child was over burdened with information from the HCPs, and would have valued a pre consultation meeting with the HCP only to ensure the information was tailored to the childÃ¢ÂÂs needs and temperament. Parents had differing views about the use of the word Ã¢ÂÂcancerÃ¢ÂÂ in consultations with their child. While some believed it should be avoided because of its perceived association with imminent death, others explained that the familial nature of the condition meant that their child could associate cancer with living a Ã¢ÂÂnormalÃ¢ÂÂ life. The se findings have implications for the way in which HCPs communicate with parents and children about genetic testing for MEN1 and MEN2 to improve efficacy of consultations.",2015

This blended learning program consists of 6.5 hours of in person content, monthly communications, and access to online resour ces. The program addresses learning objectives that help providers learn about and practice: collecting a targeted family history; identifying red flags and patterns of inheritance; assessing the clinical utility of testing; facilita ting patient decision making; communicating the benefits and limitations of testing; and using guidelines to manage care. The program was piloted with 21 PCPs in the U. S. in November 2014. Participants completed knowledge, attitudes, and confidence assessments pre and post, which were analyzed by paired t tests. Participants demonstrated improved confidence in their ability to assess hereditary cancer risk, determine appropriate referrals, and discuss the benefits, risks, and limitations of genetic testing with patients (all p<0.001), increased agreement with attitudes related to genomic risk assessment (p<0.05), and improved knowledge related to risk assessment, genetic testing, and clinical management (p , 0.01). These early results sug gest that this innovative program can build PCP skills in the assessment and management of hereditary cancer, supporting improved patient care.

This research aimed to explore how women experience undergoing carrier screening for three common inherited conditions; cystic fibrosis (CF), spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) and fragile X syndrome (FXS), through the Victorian Clinical Genetics Services (VCGS) Reproductive Genetic Carrier Screening (RGCS) program. This study adopted a qualitative approach based on phenomenology. Ten female participants were recruited and in depth semi structured interviews undertaken. Two received a pre mutation carrier result for FXS, three recei ved a carrier result for CF and five for SMA. Coded transcripts were analysed using thematic analysis to identify emerging themes. The majority of participants were pregnant during screening and described the decision to have the test as straight forward. ParticipantsÃ¢ÂÂ experienced emotional responses (anxiety and stress) whilst waiting for their partnerÃ¢ÂÂs test result and completed online research to discover more about the rele vant condition during this time. Participants were in favour of population carrier screening, preferably offered prior to conception. The findings of this study elucidated that genetic counsellors (GCs) play an essential role within this program, supporting couples after they recei ve a carrier result given the varying consent processes undertaken prior to screening. The implementation of Internet resources and GC facilitated guidance to access reliable online information is crucial to help empower couples and assist the coping process. Improving awareness of the availa bility of population carrier screening within the community will also help improve knowledge levels and facilitate preconception screening.",2015

Cascade screening is a new public health intervention that promotes systematic familial testing among relatives of individuals with known mutations. In an effort to assess the feasibility of statewide cascade screening, we examined the willingness of young breast cancer survivors (YBCS) invite their high risk relatives to participate in such a program. A randomized trial aiming to increase awareness of cancer genetics, identi fied a random sample of 3000 YBCS, diagnosed 25 45 years old, and strati fied by race (Black/Other), through the Michigan Cancer Surveillance Pro gram.

An Enhanced Genetic Service was developed in BwD in 2012, to provide genetic services to affected ethnic minority families. Whilst contributing significantly to the genetic management of these families, lack of aware ness of genetic issues in the community was apparent; amongst health care practitioners as well as the general public. It was clear that there were also barriers to accessing genetic services for families where culture, language and lack of information reduced opportunities for obtaining appropriate support. The current, genetic counsellor led initiative embraces a multi tiered ap proach, aiming to improve knowledge of genetic issues affecting the ethnic minority population in the community, to encourage engagement with gene tic services and to co ordinate a package of medical and social support.

24374,"Objective: Carrier testing enables relatives of cystic fibrosis (CF) patients to know their status regarding the CFTR mutation that segregates within their family. This test allows prevention in families and thus detection of new 1/4 risk couples. This study assessed the impact of carrier testing and searched for the predictors of uptake to testing. Methods: Forty patients born in FinistÃÂ¨re (Brittany, France) between 1980 and 2004 were enrolled. Family trees were faced with the CFTR gene studies performed in the regional laboratories. Results: Among the 462 non parent relatives eligible for testing, 185 had te sting, corresponding to an adjusted percentage of uptake of 40.4% (95% CI: [33.8%; 46.9%]). Carrier testing enables detection of 5 new 1/4 risk coup les, leading to 8 prenatal diagnoses and 5 terminations. Testing also allows to reassure many relatives (as non carrier by testing or deduction, n,247), plus 60 couples (in whom mates of carrier relatives were negative). Finally, logistic regression adjusted for clustering revealed that the main predictors of being tested were female gender (OR,1.6, p,0.007), having a high a priori risk (OR1/2 vs 1/4,3.5, p,0.006; OR2/3 vs 1/4,31.5, p<0.001) and being over 18 y. at time of diagnosis (OR,2.5, p,0.008). Over 1/3 of the tested relatives had parental project or ongoing pregnancy. Conclusion: Our study assesses, for the first time in Europe, uptake of CF carrier testing, a critical tool to reassure non carriers and to detect new at risk couples.

Methods: Notes from the newborn screening (NBS) laboratory and the me dical genetics service were used to identify children with positive screening tests and those whose families had accessed the medical genetics service. Parents of children identified as CF carriers through NBS between 1996 and 2001 were invited to participate in this study if they had disclosed their childÃ¢ÂÂs carrier status. Six families were interviewed about their experiences of finding out their child was a CF carrier and communicating this to their child and wider family. Results: Parents emphasised the need for a short period between positive screening result and the sweat test distinguishing those affected from car riers. Although some parents had worried about disclosing carrier status to their child, this caused no lasting distress. Parents would have liked to receive advice about discussing carrier status with their children but little was available. No family knew how to seek a genetics referral. Some parents were unclear about the risks of their other children being carriers. Uptake of genetic services by the parentsÃ¢ÂÂ sibs was lower than in families with an af fected child: their wider families often appeared uninterested when parents discussed carrier status. Conclusion: Professional support for effective communication around the time of a positive screening test is important. Parents may also appreciate support in communicating the implications of carrier status to their child ren.",2015

The literature to date while incomplete has profound implications for our understanding of aetiology, family burden and disease associated stigma, demonstrating the need for a psychiatric genetic counselling (PGC) intervention. Research into the expe riences of affected families can help to surmount these barriers and improve patient experience, providing a foundation from which genetic counsellors can develop confidence in the value of their services, even in the face of un certainty. This paper explores family experiences and the potential for the develop ment of a PGC service in the UK. Methods: Using a qualitative approach; relatives of individuals with schizo phrenia or a related diagnosis were asked a series of open ended questions about their experiences, their beliefs about cause, and their views about ge netic testing and PGC. The interviews were recorded, transcribed and the matic analysis was applied to the dataset. Results: The majority of participants reported no interest in genetic testing but most of them thought that GC would be invaluable to understanding ae tiology and the psychosocial aspects of CPCs.

ORG 356Back to inde x interviews and 3 focus groups with urban and rural participants. Key infor mants for the interviews included a purposefully selected sample of family physicians, nurse practitioners, and health administrators. Volunteer family physicians participated in focus groups. Thematic analysis was used; data was interpreted using constructivist grounded theory. Use of a distanced in terviewer, standardized protocol, and member checking assured consisten cy and trustworthiness of the dataResults: PCPs recognized the value of genetics, but issues around the extent to which genetics should or could be incorporated into daily practice were expressed. PCPs, particularly in rural areas, described being judicious in re ferring patients for consults and stated their role included an assessment of which patients could be managed locally. To support their decision making, a need for resources was identified. Preferred approaches across all PCPs included informal learning opportunities such as Ã¢ÂÂvirtualÃ¢ÂÂ hallway consults, web based cases and Telehealth consults. Participants became interested in supporting further genetics education opportunities locally. Conclusion: PCPs see value in genetics but identify challenges integrating genetics into practice. Identifying opportunities for informal learning has the potential to improve primary care genetics CME and to optimize PCPs involvement in genetic risk assessment, diagnosis and management. Suc cess in incorporating genetics into daily medical practice has the potential to reduce the interval from presentation to intervention, resulting in impro ved health outcomes.

24386,"The increasingly wide range of available genetic tests (GTs), understood as the analysis of hereditary characteristics using the techniques of molecular biology, biochemistry or cytogenetics, is used for the diagnosis of many ge netic pathologies. These techniques, of growing sophistication and detail, allow a more accurate clarification of unclear medical conditions, but fre quently produce Ã¢ÂÂunexpected resultsÃ¢ÂÂ (UR) or Ã¢ÂÂvariants of unknown clinical significanceÃ¢ÂÂ. The diverse ethical problems that relate to GTs, their results, and deciding who may/should be informed of findings constitute a serious challenge to health professionals. Integrated MSc Medical Students (74) from the Faculty of Medicine, Uni versity of Porto, Portugal, volunteered to answer the 13 questions of a que stionnaire about the above mentioned problems. The statistical analysis of results was done using SPSS, version 20. The social characterization of samp les revealed that mean age of students was 21,44, mostly females (70,3%). Main results showed: 1 genetic counselling before/after GT was considered very important (69%/73%.); main concern as Ã¢ÂÂprofessionalÃ¢ÂÂ dealing with UR is userÃ¢ÂÂs anxiety (82,4%); UR should importantly be transmitted in case of mendelian disease (36,5%) and affected carriers (35,1%); it was very im portant (18,9%)/important (45,9%) to further investigate UR; only someti mes (63,5%) a more precise genetic diagnosis may be beneficial, although it would help to understand the disease (74,3%); the user, if competent adult, should decide if/when do genetic tests (68,9%).With this preliminary investigation, the authors highlight the importance of bioethics studies as useful tools for medical training.",2015

In order to improve genomic litera cy in Japan, we are developing an educational program of human genetics.[Methods and Results] (1)International comparison of human genetics edu cation at school: We analyze the national curriculums of science in Japan and other countries, with particular attention to the genetics and human ge netics in order to establish human genetics education program. (2) Exhibiti on of human genetics as a program of an entertainment for kids: More than 3000 kids and their families participated in the two day event, and more than 500 come to our exhibition. Families studied DNA, gene and chromo some. (3) Lectures in a high school biology class: We conducted three 50 minute lectures on human genetics. We discussed several genetic subjects, including genetic tests and prenatal diagnosis. (4) Seminars on human gene tics for primary schoolchildren: We hold eight seminars in a year for about 100 schoolchildren in total each time. Each four hour seminar is composed of lectures, experiments and discussions.[Conclusions] Our project is unique in that students in the postgraduate course of genetic counseling and certified genetic counsellors are leading this project. The main purpose of our project is to familiarize children and parents with human genetics. We have just started the program, and it will take time to evaluate our project.

24388,"Introduction:A high proportion of postgraduate students now use Apple (iOS), Android or Windows smartphones. Mobile internet access is, however, often inter mittent or slow (eg on public transport). Moreover, online information is often unhelpful, particularly in relation to complex topics (such as clinical genomics terminology). Smartphone apps (applications) can provide user friendly alternative information sources. An app was created to provide easily accessible, comprehensible and illu strated explanations of commonly used (but often confusing) clinical geno mics acronyms, terms and processes (eg Ã¢ÂÂFASTQÃ¢ÂÂ, Ã¢ÂÂBVCFÃ¢ÂÂ, Ã¢ÂÂGVCFÃ¢ÂÂ, Ã¢ÂÂIGVÃ¢ÂÂ and Ã¢ÂÂBowtie2Ã¢ÂÂ), for students and professionals. An interactive quiz app based on the same material was also created, permitting self assessment. Materials and Methods: A cross platform application programming language was used, with Apple iOS and Android software development kits (SDKs), to build device specific apps. Creating iOS apps also required an Apple iOS Developer Program Li cence and the latest Apple Xcode software. Results: An illustrated, indexed, searchable and advertisement free, educational app plus an accompanying self assessment quiz app were created and tested on Android, iOS and Windows. Using the same programs and licences, the au thors recently also created several medical genetics self assessment apps (that have already been used by 273 undergraduate medical students with 978 total downloads). Anonymous feedback collected from the students has been 100% positive. Conclusions: It is hoped that these clinical genomics apps will be found useful by gene tics students (and perhaps even by professionals). Although their creation is complex, smartphone apps represent a convenient and quick means of obtaining information and of enhancing learning.",2015

24390,"Over 30 million Europeans are rare disease (RD) patients. RD are defined as affecting no more than 5 per 10000 persons and there are approximately 6000 recognised rare conditions, many with a genetic basis. Diseases are often life threatening or chronically debilitating and present a significant burden to patients, carers and service providers. Access to best care across the European Union (EU) is inconsistent and limited by proximity to disease experts, insufficient evidence for decision making and clinicianÃ¢ÂÂs lack of ex perience of low prevalence conditions. RARE Bestpractices is a four year project delivering an online platform to improve care management through the sharing, appraisal and development of RD best practice, knowledge and information. The project focus is to coll ect, evaluate and disseminate existing RD guidance, to cultivate a robust methodology and suite of tools appropriate to RD guideline development, and to facilitate collaboration, knowledge exchange and research in the area of RD. Collection development is underway to populate new RD guidelines and research recommendation databases. The guideline database will facilita te appraisal of new and existing guidance using AGREE II methodology to support easy identification of best quality clinical guidance for clinicians, patients and their carers. RDs affect a large number of the population.

This has required multidisciplinary working between Genetics and Haematology and a comprehensive service is now being delivered to these patients. Pa thways were devised for four areas; antenatal, non urgent, possible Alpha Thalassaemia carriers and affected individuals. Antenatal: Patients with abnormal/unusual haemoglobin screening results were referred to Medical Genetics via the antenatal clinic. Partner testing was arranged where requested and high risk couples offered prenatal dia gnosis or neonatal testing. Non urgent: All carriers of clinically significant Haemoglobinopathies were seen routinely by Specialist Genetic Counsellors in the genetics clinic. Those who required further testing to confirm the carrier state were not seen until molecular testing had been carried out. This allowed the results to be explai ned in full without the need for further appointments. Possible Alpha Thalassaemia Carriers:Due to the high carrier frequency of possible Alpha Thalassaemia, with up to around 17% of the world population being carriers, it is neither necessary nor possible to confirm all carriers.

First degree relatives of individuals with these mutations are at a 50% risk of being a carrier, disclosing genetic information to family members can be complex. This study explored how families living in Ireland communicate genetic information about ICCs and looked at the challenges of communicating information, factors that may af fect communication and what influence this had on family relationships. Face to face interviews were conducted with nine participants using an ap proved topic guide and results analysed using Thematic Analyses. The par ticipants disclosed that responsibility to future generations, gender, lack of contact and proximity, all played a role in family communication. The media was cited as sources of information and knowledge of genetic information tended to have a positive effect on families. Results from this study indica te that individuals are willing to inform family members, particularly when there are children and grandchildren at risk, and different strategies are uti lised. Furthermore, people do not live in vacuums and their understanding of genetics is partially regulated, not only by their families but by the way society handles information. Therefore, genetic health professionals should take into account the familial influence on individuals and their decision to attend genetic services, and also that of the media.",2015

Sultanate of Oman is one of the Isla mic countries that follow regulations against termination of fetus unless for maternal indications. Preimplantation genetic diagnosis is allowed under regulations but not available within the country. Considering the fact that fa mily intermarriage is favored, providing premarital genetic counseling and testing for individuals at risk of familial disease should aid risk reduction. A highly inbred family with autosomal recessive Lamellar Ichthyosis has had a known familial mutation in the TGM1 gene since 2008. Despite the availa bility of the test the number of individuals considering carrier status testing was unremarkable for four years. The main barrier of premarital testing is the geographic distance to the testing center, where the family have to tra vel thousands of miles for counseling and testing.

24396,"After the first regional initiatives to screen newborns for PKU in the United Kingdom and United States in the 1960s, several European countries set up screening programmes. Though the number of disorders screened for gra dually increased, European countries differed in their choices for specific screening strategies and the number of disorders screened for: from 1 to 29 (Loeber et al., 2012). For instance, in case of Congenital Hypthyroidism, the Netherlands followed Canada and several US states in the strategy used to detect both primary and central forms of CH, while most European coun tries concentrated on the primary forms. The Netherlands was one of the first countries to introduce screening for Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia (in 2000). The reasons for this variety may range from health care priori ties and budgets to practical considerations, organisational constraints or, perhaps, chance. Pollitt (2006) has suggested that the differences may be related to the professional background of individuals involved in policy making. For the US the influence of patient organisations and commercial parties has been mentioned (Paul & Brosco, 2013) . For the Netherlands we did not find evidence that these latter forces have played a major role. In our (poster) presentation we will highlight our research on the expansion of the Dutch programme after its beginning in 1974 (Loeber & Van El 2014).

24397,"Neurofibromatosis Type I is one of the most common autosomal dominant disorders. It is caused by mutations of the NF1 gene. Disease penetrance is about 100%, while patients present mutational, allelic or phenotypic he terogeneity. Clinical features include cafÃÂ© au lait spots, skinfold freckling, cutaneous or plexiform neurofibromas, optic gliomas and Lisch nodules of the iris. Molecular diagnosis includes multi step PCR, sequencing of all exons of NF1 and multiplex ligation dependent probe amplification. The protocol was va lidated in a cohort of 80 NF1 patients and their relatives, identifying the germline mutations in the most of the cases. The effects of these mutations were assessed in combination with the clinical phenotype and using in silico analysis. Our results include 28 known and 23 novel variants in coding and non coding regions. The majority of novel mutations included stop codon mu tations and small insertions or deletions. We also found whole NF1 gene deletion at two unrelated patients with severe clinical manifestations.

Our vision is to develop core videos on topics such as pedigree drawing, genetic cascade and predictive testing, exome/genome sequencing, incidental findings and ethics, relevant to practises in Ireland. Outside of the core, we have specialist topic videos relevant to genetics, created by colleagues from diverse disciplines. Our tar get audience are health care professionals from all aspects of mainstream medicine. Much of our content, such as our six animated videos, are freely available on YouTube. These videos already have ~20,000 views. Families can view them prior to an appointment. We found that short videos (~5 minutes) are more popular; the viewer stays with the video through its entirety in contrast to long videos. As viewers post thumbs up and thumbs down as well as comments, this is a useful way of gaining prompt feedback. Our two recent chromosome translocation videos have already had 6,000 views and are being linked in with Unique, the rare chromosome support group.

Methods: Men completed a questionnaire prior to each annual screening vi sit. The questionnaires included sociodemographic data and the following measures: HADS, IES, SF36, MAX PC, Cancer Worry Scale, self reported risk perception and a knowledge questionnaire (understanding of BRCA1/2 and PrCa). The results of the baseline questionnaires are presented. Results: In total 484 men enrolled in the QoL study and uptake was 82 100% at participating sites. Mean scores for HADS and SF36 were within reported population norms and mean IES scores were within normal range. No statistically significant differences were observed between groups. Ave rage knowledge score was 77%, demonstrating a good understanding. Mean MAX PC scores were low suggesting a low level of prostate cancer specific worry. Cancer worry levels were low and BRCA2 carriers in particular per ceived their risk of PrCa to be higher than average. Conclusions: Uptake of the QoL study is high in participating centres.

Advances in medicine mean that a greater number of tests are being carried out that have a predictive component. With greater awareness of genetic status from screening programmes and genomic testing we can no longer advocate that genetic testing should only be undertaken in exceptional circumstances. The lack of a robust evidence base for the long term psychosocial outcomes leaves the decision to test at the discretion of the geneticist. The concept of best interest is unclear and there may be a conflict of interest between parents and child. When should testing be carried out at the request of the parents, how and when should testing be discussed with a child and how and when should results be communicated subsequently. We have reviewed all cases in our department where predictive or pre sym ptomatic genetic testing has been carried out in childhood and examined the factors influencing the decision to test. For predictive testing in all cases the parent requesting was the mother even when the affected parent was the father. Testing was more likely to be reque sted and undertaken where there were traumatic family circumstances and often in an attempt to end the impact of the condition on the family. Testing was often carried out ultimately because of fear of harm to the patient pro fessional relationship.

Existing findings suggest that while some families have difficulty adapting to the ongoing challenges associated with raising an individual with DS, others adapt successfully and some even thrive. Stigma experiences may play a critical role in how well a family ad apts. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to explore experiences with stigma among families of individuals with DS living in Ireland, Korea, Portu gal, Thailand, United Kingdom, and USA. Method: Over 1200 parents of individuals with DS completed an online sur vey which included a variety of self report measures plus open ended que stions concerning how parents were informed of the DS diagnosis. A sub set of parents were also interviewed. Results: Many parents reported experiencing stigma when they were first informed of the diagnosis of DS.

Although carrier screening has tradi tionally been performed for a small number of common disorders, recent advances in genetics led to the emergence of expanded carrier screening (ECS) panels, which screen for an increasing number of recessive disorders at little or no additional cost. However, expansion of screening panels adds a new layer of complexity to carrier screening, making large scale implemen tation of ECS controversial. In depth interviews were conducted with 16 geneticists from 8 EEA coun tries in order to explore participantsÃ¢ÂÂ views on ECS. While they acknowledge the important potential benefits of ECS, most participants were reluctant to start actively offering screening to the general population. They raised concerns regarding limited understanding of genetics among laypersons, which may result in misinterpretation or confusion over complex issues of ECS and preclude informed reproductive decision making. Furthermore, the absence of suitable infrastructure, limited public resources, and lack of expertise in genetic testing among healthcare providers were all identified as important challenges to ECS in the general population. However, most participants believed ECS should be made available to the couples who re quest it. In addition, some geneticists favored routinely offering ECS to pati ents undergoing artificial reproduction (AR). It was argued that providers of AR have an obligation to utilize state of the art technologies such as ECS to avoid conception of a fetus with a severe disorder.",2015

The findings highlight very different patterns of practices depending on the genetic diseases concerned, and on the profes sionalsÃ¢ÂÂ competencies in genetics. 26% of respondents declare having no competency in genetics. It is equally crucial to sharpen a number of points, such as the nature of genetic testing, their possible prescription by non geneticist clinicians, the scope of genetic counselling and its role in the disclosure process, the nature of information to deliver to patients and their relatives.

Introduction of a sign language in special schools for deaf people led to growth of assortative marriages between them and contributed to increase of genetic fitness of deaf people. Combined effect of assortative mating and relaxed selection probably has doubled the GJB2 gene associated deafness in the US over the past 200 years (Nance et al., 2004; Arnos et al., 2008). High prevalence of the GJB2 deafness and relatively recent (~ 60 years ago) introduction of sign language among deaf people were recorded in Yaku tia (Eastern Siberia).

Our ratio nale was that the translation of these technologies into practice could be facilitated by addressing these ethical, legal and social challenges prospec tively rather than on an ad hoc basis as they arise. Five iterative stakeholder workshops were held on the following topics: the experiences of empirical researchers as NGS technologies are implemented in clinical settings; the impact of these technologies on the interface between research and clinical care in genomics; the influence of these technologies on the clinical pati ent pathway; using targeted approaches based on gene lists as a precursor to opening the genome and effect on consent, technical aspects, reanalysis and recontact; and finally the infrastructural prerequisites of evidence base development and mandated data sharing. Focusing on ethical challenges obtaining a valid and informed consent, ensuring effective data sharing, developing managed systems for gene list construction, proportionate sy stems for reporting incidental findings, and the potential for reanalysis and recontact within a publicly funded but resource limited health system has fostered a comprehensive framework for action, that has been welcomed by stakeholders and will build public trust.

Personalised medicine thus is still a term subject to negotiation among stakeholders, including the ge neral public. Additionally, technical, cost and data protection issues are up for debate. Since patients and citizens in general are called upon to make their biological tissue and genetic data available for personalised medicine related research purposes, public participation is considered necessary to realise the vision of personalised medicine in socially robust ways on the EU and national level. The paper presents the results of a deliberative project with experts and citizens on personalised medicine in the Austrian context throughout the year 2014. It analyses how experts from a variety of backgrounds (mole cular biology, medicine, industry, ethics, and regulation) discussed the cur rent framework conditions, expectations and challenges for personalised medicine in three stakeholder workshops, and compares these results with how members of the general public debated the term personalised medici ne, prevention, cost, and data contribution issues in four citizen dialogue events. The paper focuses specifically on the central social, ethical and legal issues that were raised in these dialogue processes and reflects on the im plications of these findings for communication activities directed towards the general public.

24428,"PGD technology can increasingly detect genetic disorders and traits. Ethic committees are involved in understanding which usage for PGD is ethical ly justified. There has been considerable debate about the different uses of PGD and especially about the regulation of selecting embryos with non let hal, treatable or late onset conditions. Almost all guidelines worldwide ban PGD to less severe conditions or highly regulate it. Exploring attitudes toward ethical and sociological aspects of PGD among 35 Israeli PGD users (carriers of autosomal recessive, dominant and X lin ked disorders; HLA matching) reveal totally different notions rather than these strict guidelines. High overall approval of PGD to any medical conditi on including non lethal conditions, treatable conditions (e.g. deafness) and late onset conditions (e.g. cancer predisposition) was mentioned and the onset age of condition did not play a role in the arguments for preventing any kind of abnormality. As to the controversial issue of social sex selec tion, the majority of surveyed subjects thought it would be appropriate to allow it for purposes of family balancing or cultural preferences. Yet, most of those in favor of this use thought performing PGD for this use only is an extreme step. In conclusion, our sample of Israeli subjects shows permissi ve attitudes to different application of PGD. These liberal attitudes of PGD users are not reflected in the guidelines made by the many ethic committees discussed these issues. The isolation between medical bioethics expertsÃ¢ÂÂ decisions and PGD consu mersÃ¢ÂÂ perspectives should not be ignored in the professional discussion and the design of policy making.",2015
24429,"Genetic testing allow the identification of individuals who are carriers of some mutations in their genes, these mutations being the cause of some ge netic disorders. Presently, three types of genetic testing are known: diagno stic, carrier and predictable. Predictive tests identify whether an individual is carrier of a genetic mutation and if there is the possibility to develop ge netic disorders at a late on set. It is known that the first autosomal dominant genetic disease for which a predictive test was developed is HuntingtonÃ¢ÂÂs disease. Unfortunately, if in the diagnostic and carrier tests we have the technical possibilities and they are correlated with the norms of the Romanian Me dical System, when we talk about the predictive genetic tests, the situati on is different because this type of diagnostic test isnÃ¢ÂÂt implemented yet in Romania. In Romania, we have some limitations regarding this type of pre dictive tests, because we donÃ¢ÂÂt have interdisciplinary teams in the hospitals to coordinate the management of these cases. Another limitation regards the ethical problems of information and patient consent. The lack of policy decisions, education campaigns, misinformation and lack of understanding regarding genetic diseases, leads to discriminatory practices. All these problems need to be urgently solved and implemented in Roma nia, due to the special aspects belonging to them, especially in patients with Huntington disease.",2015

Background: Tumor screening in hereditary paraganglioma allows early surgery. PGL EVA is a 3 year French national protocol of tumor screening in SDHx mutation carriers. Methods: Depression (BDI 13), state and trait anxiety (STAI) and stress due to genetic test result (IES R) were assessed at baseline in 197 subjects. Depression and state anxiety were assessed again after tumor screening and then once a year. Results: At baseline, depression and stress were higher in index cases (p,0.023) than in rela tives (p,0.013). After tumor screening, depression (p,0.003) and anxiety decreased (p,0.006). Final score of depression at 36 months (73 patients) was significantly associated with baseline score (p<0.001), without any sig nificant change. Higher depression scores were observed in index cases vs relatives and in women vs men. Final anxiety scores were significantly as sociated with baseline scores (p<0.001), without any significant change. In women, anxiety scores decreased between baseline and 36 months (p,0.03). The evolution of depression and anxiety scores was neither asso ciated with the screening of new tumors, nor with the status of index cases vs relatives. Anxiety score evolution was negatively associated with baseline trait anxie ty and stress. Conclusions: Tumor screening in genetically predisposed sub jects does not lead to worsening emotional disturbances after three years of follow up.

The data on a value of metalloproteinases genes allele variants in early embryogenesis disturbances are poor and con troversial. The purpose of current study was to investigate the association between MMP genes polymorphism and pregnancy loss. DNA samples were isolated from blood leukocytes of 134 women with early pregnancy loss and 144 women with normal pregnancy. 1607insG MMP 1 gene, A 8202G MMP 9 gene and C536T TIMP 1 gene polymorphisms were analyzed with allele specific PCR. The distribution of genotype and allele frequencies of 1697insG MMP 1 gene polymorphism in women with early pregnancy loss was equal to control group. While percentage of homozy gous genotypes of A 8202 allele of MMP 9 gene was increased compared to control group.

24436,"Introduction The causes of infertility are very complex, cytogenetic anoma lies being one of the possible causes. In the last years was taken in consi deration the hypothesis that not only somatic chromosomal anomalies but also germ cells chromosomal aberrations could lead to reproductive failure. The difficulties related to chromosomal evaluation in germ cells were over come by the development of molecular cytogenetic techniques use. Aim. We have study the hypothesis of a possible correlation between sperm parameters and the incidence of aneuploidy. Materials and method In this study we used multicolor FISH probes for chromosome 13, 18, 21, X and Y and strict scoring criteria, in order to evalu ate 35 patients with oligoasthenoteratozoospermia (OAT) and 20 individual with normal fertility. Results The overall incidence of disomy in the OAT group showed a weak to moderate correlation with the semen parameters. In this study we found a moderate negative correlation between the disomy incidence and the sperm concentration (r, 0.49). By comparing the disomy incidence and the pro gressive motility and the normal morphology we found a weak negative cor relation, the correlation coefficients were r, 0.39 and r, 0.36 respectively. Previous studies have reported negative correlation between the rate of chromosome aneuploidy and semen parameters. Conclusions The molecular cytogenetic analysis allows the identification of patients with an increased risk for reproduction failure and facilitate an ap propriate counseling in order to inform the patients about their reproduc tive options, the genetic preimplantation testing and the prenatal genetic tests that are available.",2015

CASE RAPORT: Female newborn had all characteristics typical for Down syndrome: facial dysmorphia, muscle hypotonia, a single flexion fur row of the fifth finger on the right hand, short fingers and a heart anomaly. Derivative chromosome 21, was detected in all 30 studied metaphase cells. G banding technique showed translocation between two chromosomes 21, joined with terminal ends of the long arm. C banding technique showed a single centromere. QF Ã¢ÂÂ PCR analysis of newbornÃ¢ÂÂs DNA, showed six mar kers on the chromosome 21 with trisomic dialelic patterns (D21S1442, D21S1414, D21S1435, D21S1446, D21S1809, D21S1412), one marker with trialelic trisomic (D21S1437) and one normal heterozygous marker (D21S1411). Parents had normal karyotypes. After QF Ã¢ÂÂ PCR analysis from parentsÃ¢ÂÂ DNA, normal markers ratios were found in fatherÃ¢ÂÂs DNA, but one marker (D21S1437) in motherÃ¢ÂÂs was in trialelic state . Mother had muscle hypotonia, a flat nasal bridge and a single flexion furrow of the fifth finger on the left hand, but she was a person of average intelligence and without other specific clinical characteristics.

Genetic fac tors were found to have important roles in the etiology of idiopathic azoo spermia and severe oligospermia patients, affecting sperm production or sperm transport. Materials and Methods: Since 2006, samples of 62 azoospermia patients were analyzed using cytogenetic, molecular cytogenetic and molecular ge netic methods. Cytogenetic analysis were performed on cultured PHA sti mulated blood lymphocites using GTG banding. Fluorescence in situ hybri dization (FISH) was performed using a Y chromosome specific DYZ3 locus. Presence of microdeletions in AZF region on Y chromosome was analyzed using multiplex PCR reactions for amplification of ZFX/ZFY, SRY, AZFa, AZFb and AZFc regions. Results: Cytogenetic analysis showed presence of aberrant karyotype in 9 patients. Structural chromosomal aberrations were detected in four pati ents (one with dicentric Y chromosome, two with deletion of long arm of Y chromosome, delYq11.22 and one patient with balanced translocation). Numerical chromosomal aberrations were detected in five patients (four of them with 47,XXY karyotype and one patient with two Y chromosomes 47 ,XYY). Results of molecular genetic testing showed that five patiens had AZF deletions (two with AZFc deletion and three with AZFbc deletion). All pati ents were offered genetic counseling service in our hospital. Conclusion: The results of this study have determinated the cause of azoo spermia in 19.35% of all analysed patients. Given that our results showed high prevalence of genetic aberrations in infertile men, application of gene tic testing in such cases is fully justified.",2015

In the absence of the bloodstaining the allele ratios were inconclusive showing two different profiles. After QF PCR of mother blood sample was performed, we found out that this result was consistent with motherÃ¢ÂÂs profile.

Introduction: Only one out of eight congenital heart defects (CHD) is as sociated with chromosomal disorders, yet non invasive prenatal diagno stics focuses majorly on screening for trisomies instead of cardiac malfor mations. Assumed to modify up to 60 percent of human protein encoding genes, microRNAs play an important role in cardiogenesis and present an intriguing marker for standalone CHD screening. The aim of this study was to investigate the role and the maternal plasma expression of fetal hsa miR 99a in pregnancies affected by CHD. Materials and methods: Peripheral blood samples were collected from 39 pregnant women: 22 pregnancies were affected by CHD and 17 pregnan cies were CHD free controls. MiRNA was isolated from maternal serum and quantitative real time PCR was carried out to determine the expression of total miRNA, u6 snRNA and hsa miR 99a. Results: While there was no significant difference between the miRNA concentrations among CHD affected and control group (5.54 ng/ÃÂµl vs. 6.40 ng/ÃÂµl), we found significantly up regulated hsa miR 99a levels in the CHD affected group (1.78 ÃÂ 10 2 ng/ÃÂµl ÃÂ± 3.53 ÃÂ 10 2 vs. 1.09 ÃÂ 10 2 ÃÂ± 3.55 ÃÂ 10 3 ng/ÃÂµl, p , 0.038).Conclusions: According to our study, hsa miR 99a is overexpressed in preg nancies affected by a variety of CHD, could be used to monitor fetal cardioge nesis during early pregnancy and to non invasively screen for CHD indepen dent of chromosomal disorders.",2015

Primary ovarian insufficiency (POI) is defined as irregular menses and elevated gonadotrophin levels before or at the age of 40 years. The FMR1 intermediate (35 54 CGGs) and premutation (55 200 CGGs) alleles have been related with the development of this condition. A group of 68 women with ovarian dysfunction of unknown aetiology and 47 control women from the Basque Country was analyzed. The length of the repeat and the AGG in terspersion pattern were evaluated. In relation to the number of CGG re peats, the frequency of alleles with 35 200 CGG repeats was statistically hig her in the patient group (12.50% vs. 0%). This group was divided into three categories: group 1, irregular cycles, reduced fecundity and FSH levels <10 IU/l; group 2, irregular cycles reduced fecundity and FSH levels Ã¢ÂÂ¥10 IU/l and group 3, amenorrhea for at least 4 consecutive months and FSH levels Ã¢ÂÂ¥10 IU/l. In the three subgroups the frequency of alleles with 35 200 CGG was statistically higher than in controls. Regarding the AGG interspersion pattern, many of the intermediate and premutation alleles among patients appeared to have two interruptions (70%), the first AGG located in the 10 th position (75%) and more than 15 CGG at the 3Ã¢ÂÂ end (83.3%). Interestingly, among these alleles the predominant structure was 9+9+n, indicating a loss of AGG interruptions at the 3Ã¢ÂÂ end. Therefore, the data showed that among patients the alleles were more unstable and that this instability influencing the FMR1 expansion might be related with the development of an ovarian dysfunction.",2015

The 1T QUAD has significantly higher success than PAPP A and fbhCG only as reliability for aneuploidy and PE risk calculation. Trisomy 21 risk 1:50000 1:100000 was in 56% in 1T QUAD compared to Ã¢ÂÂdualÃ¢ÂÂ strategy with 2.1%. It provides optimal NIPT indication according selected risk criteria. Same PE screening success is guaranteed by decreased PlGF levels in IInd trimester as in Ist one, in intermediate and late PE detection even in negative Ist trime ster PlGF screening. PlGF 5th percentile levels were created for 9 38th week for improvement of all PE types prediction. PlGF levels higher than 270 pg/ml in IInd and IIIrd trimester eliminate in 100% PE risk. The 1T QUAD strategy significantly improves aneuploidy and PE detection in Ist trimester. Decreased PlGF levels in IInd trimester within 14 20th and 20 29th weeks significantly improve detection of not only aneuploidy and all types of PE but also severe disorders of prenatal development.

24447,"Introduction: The defect of matrix remodeling and the imbalance of ECMÃ¢ÂÂs construction and destruction are important in male infertility. It is not enough to explain idiopatic cases because there are lots of unknown sub jects in studyings which make clear spermatogenesis process. The development of molecular methods is needed because it lets us to un derstand the fertilization steps and will be used in these patients. Lately there are lots of studies in literature about metalloproteinases which have different physiological functions in human metabolism and play a crucial role in construction and destruction of ECM. But there are very few studies about male infertilityÃÂ°n this study, our aim is to investigate the role of ADAMTS5 proteases which is responsible for degrafdation of ECM in spermatogenesis. Material method: In this study, we divided infertile mens into four groups. We isolated protein from semen samples taken from 10 control, 10 oligo spermia, 10 idiopatic infertile and 5 azoospermia groups. We analysed pro tein levels with western blot. Results : According to results, we determined that the protein levels of ADAMTS5 decreased 2,68 and 1,66 fold in azospermia and oligospermia groups respectively than control groups. And we didnÃ¢ÂÂt find any differences between control groups and idiopatic infertile groups. ABSTRACTS PUBLISHED ABSTRACTS ESHG 2015 | GLASGOW, SCOTLAND, UK | WWW. ESHG.

Introduction More than 4 million infants have been born after assisted reproductive tech niques (ART) around the world. There are contradictories data about neo natal outcomes and risk of major congenital malformations (MCM) in this population. Objective: to describe the prevalence of neonatal complications and MCM at the age of one year in a cohort of children born after ART com pared to spontaneous births, and to determine associated factors. Material and methods Prospective cohort study of children born from women undergoing IVF/ ICSI treatment between may 2012 february 2013, in Assisted Reproduction Service of Spanish tertiary Hospital. Cause of infertility, embryo transfer (ET) day (D), maternal age, neonatal outcome and presence of MCM were analysed. Results 107/121 live births were assessed (participation 88%). Mean maternal age: 32 years. 26% were multiple gestations (MG). Prematurity in 22/107 (20%) associated to MG (19/22). Mean birth weight: 2900 g (p40). 19/107 needed hospitalisation. At the age of one, 11 presented MCM (10%) according to ICD 10 classification: congenital malformation of cardiac septa (6), aortic valve (1), nervous system (2) and congenital hydronephrosis (1). It was as sociated significantly (p<0.05) to ET D5/D6 and feminine infertility was a protective factor. No association with maternal age or MG. Conclusions Neonatal hospitalisation and prematurity were higher than in spontaneous births, but it seems to be associated to MG. Prevalence of MCM was high er than expected and congenital heart disease was the most frequent. The association with late ET suggests that the culture might be a predisposing factor. Further studies will be necessary to assess these results.",2015

24451,"Introduction: Recurrent pregnancy losses (RPL) are affecting approximately 3% of women and are a significant clinical problem, in many cases asso ciated with thrombophilia. An increased risk of thrombophilic complicati ons occurs during pregnancy, owing to reorganization of the coagulation/anti coagulation and phibrinolitic organisms systems that are thought to be an evolution adaptation to reduce blood losses during delivery. The aim of this study was to screen the incidence of five thrombophilic mu tations and to determine if their presence is associated with RPL. Materials and Methods: using RFLP/PCR were screened the FII(G20210A), FV(G1691A), VKORC1(C1173T and G1639A) and PAI1(4G/5G) mutations in case/control groups. Case group contained 274 women with 2 or more abortions and control group 68 women with at least 2 normal pregnancies and no abortion. For data analysis was used Chi square test and Odds ratio (OR) calculations. Results: the incidence of homozygous and heterozygous mutations in FII (OR 2.18, 95% CI 0.26, 18.13, p>0.05), FV (OR 6.86, 95% CI 0.90, 52.48, p<0.05) genes was associated with RPL in the case group and represent a risk fac tors.

24454,"Reciprocal chromosomal rearrangements, de novo or inherited, often raise a concern about the fetal health and outcome in the affected pregnancies. The size and origin of the translocated chromosomes could be variable. Cryptic translocations often remain undetected and misdiagnosed. Several studies confirmed that there could be a loss of a certain amount of genomic material within breakpoints, which lead to uncertainties in predicting the pregnancy outcome. A 38 year pregnant woman approached our clinic for a genetic counseling. This was her first pregnancy, ultrasound follow up showed normal fetal growth; the amniocentesis was done due to the advanced maternal age. Con ventional cytogenetic report showed putative deletion of short arm of chro mosome 5. Additional cordocentesis has been done at 18 week of pregnancy. MLPA analysis showed that 5p critical region was present. FISH has been done, using 5p/q probe (Cytocell aquarius, Cat No LPU 013), which showed cryptic de novo translocation 46,XX, ish t(5p;17q). Reduced fetal growth was recorded after 20th week, and together with cytogetetic finding were decisive for the parents to terminate the pregnancy. Examination at autopsy showed dismorphism consistent with cri du chat syndrome micrognathia, hypertelorism, SGA, as well as underdeveloped brain for gestational period. Novel technologies in molecular cytogenetics and array techniques could help in detecting minor imbalances and decrease the risk of the birth of malformed fetus.

Female predominance among carriers of reciprocal translocations (rec) has been commonly explained by male sterility, though appropriate com parative studies had not been carried out. The objectives of this study were comparative analysis of rates of balanced CA carriers among patients with infertility and among patients with recurrent miscarriages and comparati ve analysis of male to female ratio (sex ratio, SR) in the carriers. Method: Meta analysis of data from 25 publications on prevalence of CA in couples with reproduction failures. Results: Among couples with infertility, rec car riers were found in 0.46% of males (63/13,573) and in 0.38% of females (51/13,595), SR,1.2, not different from population value of 1.06. Robert sonian translocation (rob) carriers were found in 0.52% of females and in 0.16% of males, SR,3.2, different from 1.06, p<0.001. Carriers of inversion (inv) were less frequent among males (0.15% vs 0.26%). Among couples with recurrent miscarriages, rec carriers were more frequent compared to those among infertile couples: 0.86% of males (113/13,192) and 1.54% of females (203/13,192), SR,0.56, p<0.001. Robs were found in 0.41% of ma les and in 0.74% of females, SR,0.55, p<0.001. Rate of inv was 0.14% in both males and females. Conclusion: The data obtained corroborate with the conception of female predominance among fertile carriers of rob due to male sterility. However female predominance among fertile carriers of rec can not be explained by the same reason. Firstly, there is no significant male prevalence among infertile carriers, secondly, the rate of rec carriers among infertile males is lower compared to that among fertile patients.",2015

24460,"The immotile short tail sperm (ISTS) defect, is a syndrome which causes male infertility. Patients with ISTS disorder have immotile short tailed sperms which can not fertilize oocyte. Numerous proteins are involved in sperm structure. One of these proteins is RAB Like 2B (RABL2B), which re cently its essential role in sperm tail assembly and fertility in male mouse has been demonstrated. So its gene, which called RAB Like 2B (RABL2B), is an appropriate candidate gene in human studies. RABL2B protein has 4 GTP binding domains. Exons 4 and 5 of this gene code two of these essential domains. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the genetic variations of exons 4 and 5 of RABL2B gene in infertile men with ISTS defect and controls. In this study, 30 infertile men with ISTS defect and 30 normozospermic men as controls were recruited. Remarkably, because of the rarity of this disorder, it took 2 years to collect patients samples. To study the genetic variations, DNA was extracted from peripheral blood, then PCR sequencing was done. Sequence analysis results did not identify any mutations or single nucleoti de polymorphisms (SNPs) in exons 4 and 5 of RABL2B gene in patients and controls. Considering the fact that RABL2B is evolutionarily so conserved and exons 4 and 5 have a very important role, therefore the absence of varia tions is fully justified. On the other hand, as RABL2B has a high expression in testis, evaluation of other parts of this gene is recommended. Reference:Anu sironen. TURUN YLIOPISTO. Turku 2009.

In the present study 50 azoosperm patients who had no deletions in the AZFb and AZFc region were studied for deletions in the AZFa region. 50 men who had at least one child were considered as the control group. Microdeletion frequencies were calculated using the Multiplex PCR for SY81, SY746, SY742, USP9Y, DDX3Y, SY86, SY84 STS markers. The results indicated the deletion of USP9Y, SY81, DDX3Y markers with the frequency of 4% for each one. However, no deleti on was observed for sY84 and sY86 markers. There was no deletion in the control group.

Background: Inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) through its product, nitric oxide (NO), contributes to the induction of germ cell apoptosis. This study was designed to investigat the effects of Aloe vera gel on male rat re productive organs and its relation with serum NO and expression of iNOS gene in testis cells. Methods: 36 adult male Wistar rats were designed into 3 equal groups. The rats received normal saline (control) or Aloe vera gel at doses of 150 and 300 mg/kg, orally for 60 days. Then they were mated with untreated female rats. Then reproductive organs of rat weights, semen quality, serum testo sterone concentrations in male rats and the rate of fertility in female rats were assessed. At the same time, the in vivo capacity to produced NO, was measured by Griess method and gene expression for iNOS was also studied by Real Time PCR. Results: A PCR product of the expected size amplified iNOS mRNA gene was expressed in testis cells and increased the serum NO level after 60 days in the treatment groups, in compared to control. Furthermore, the weights of the testes, seminal vesicle and the sperm count of male rats and serum te stosterone concentrations as well as the pregnancy rate were reduced in experimental groups compared to control.

24473,"Introduction: PGD is traditionally performed by biopsy of cleavage stage (Day 3) embryos, genetic testing of the biopsied material, and fresh embryo transfer. This approach provides limited time for analysis and interpretation of genetic testing, and for discussion of results with the couple; clinically there is also a risk of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) and high multiple pregnancy rate. Materials and Methods: 161 couples who were carriers of either monogenic diseases (n,127) or chromosomal rearrangements (n,34) underwent oocy te retrieval after controlled ovarian stimulation using a protocol optimised for reduction of OHSS. Trophectoderm biopsy of day 5 or 6 blastocysts was followed by vitrification. DNA analysis of biopsies was by whole genome amplification and Preimplantation Genetic Haplotyping for monogenic di seases or array CGH for chromosome rearrangements. Following diagnosis and patient counselling, single embryos were warmed and transferred. Results: 85 pregnancies were achieved (53% per couple) with no cases of mild or severe OHSS (0%), one monozygotic multiple pregnancy (1.1% per pregnancy, similar to the natural incidence of multiple pregnancy) and high patient satisfaction. These results compare favourably with those in the prior 12 months, when 11 patients (4%) developed OHSS (P<0.001) and the multiple pregnancy rate was 13% (P<0.001). Testing throughput has in creased from five to nine couples per week, delivering an 80% increase in productivity with no increase in staff numbers.

ICSI as a part of assisted reproductive technologies allows infertile men to father a child bypassing natural selection barriers. Sperm selection main ly relies on its morphological characteristics. Sure, the spermatozoa with normal morphology or with light pathology would be selected for fertili zation. But in case of severe teratozoospermia one should choose the most appropriate sperm from those with abnormal morphology. So, to know if the sperm morphology reflects its DNA fragmentation was the aim of this study since the sperm DNA fragmentation is associated with reduced embryo qua lity, implantation and live birth rates. Sperm samples from two men with normal somatic karyotypes and terato zoospermia were collected by masturbation. Shortly after ejaculate liquef action under the high magnification the spermatozoa with large nuclear va cuoles were selected. As a control the spermatozoa with normal morpholo gy were used. To analyze sperm DNA fragmentation TUNEL assay was used. Among sperm with large nuclear vacuoles DNA fragmentation rate was ex tremely higher compare to the control 14,29% vs. 1,12% (p , 0,0008).So, large nuclear vacuoles in sperm head may be a morphological marker of its DNA fragmentation.

Of the 271 prenatal samples received from 1/2014 to 1/2015, 6.3 % were an euploid by QF PCR testing and validated by karyotyping. In 9 female fetuses (46,XX) ZFY was found, which is normally present on the Y chromosome. This phenomenon will be further examined upon receiving parental DNA. In addition, we revealed a signal for marker Ã¢ÂÂD18S386Ã¢ÂÂ located at locus 18q22.1. Parental DNA analysis was normal in all tested cases and proved that the extra peak in Ã¢ÂÂD18S386Ã¢ÂÂ represents the missing paternal allele of marker Ã¢ÂÂD13S305Ã¢ÂÂ (13q13.3).

In the majority of patients, multiple congenital malformations are present. The etiology re mains unknown, but is likely to be heterogeneous with both environmen tal and genetic factors playing a role. The aim of this study was to test the association of ARM with two known polymorphisms in the developmental genes BMP4 and GLI2 in a large group of Caucasian patients, as well as the gene gene interaction. Material and methods: A case control study was performed in a Caucasian population of 431 nonsyndromic ARM patients and 661 population based controls. Patients and controls were derived from the AGORA (Aetiologic research on Genetic and Occupational/environmental Risk factors for Ano malies in children) data and biobank of the Radboudumc Nijmegen, The Netherlands. Genotyping was performed using Kompetitive Alleles Specific PCR assays. Results: The non synonymous SNP rs17563 in BMP4 was not associated with ARM, but we did find associations between ARM and the non synony mous SNP rs3738880 in GLI2, especially in ARM patients with multiple con genital malformations (homozygous GG genotype: OR,2.1; 95%CI: 1.2 3.7). A 4 fold increased risk was shown when homozygous variant genotypes of both genes were present (OR,4.1; 95%CI: 1.0 17.8).Conclusions: We showed independent associations between the variant in GLI2 and ARM in patients with multiple congenital malformations.

24480,"BackgroundHypospadias is a common congenital malformation of the penis with a dis location of the urethral opening. It has a multifactorial etiology. Folate is important during embryogenesis. Folate levels are reduced by the C677T polymorphism in the methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) gene, which is involved in the etiology of several birth defects, but was never studied for hypospadias. Maternal periconceptional use of folic acid sup plements may compensate for reduced folate levels and play a role in the prevention of birth defects. Although this was confirmed for some congeni tal malformations, results for hypospadias are inconsistent. Therefore, we investigated independent associations and interactions of maternal folic acid use and maternal and infant MTHFR C677T polymorphisms with risk of hypospadias. MethodsWe conducted a case control study among 697 nonsyndromic hypospadias cases and 711 controls from the AGORA data and biobank. Information about folic acid use was derived from maternal questionnaires and DNA samples from mother and child were used to genotype the MTHFR C677T polymorphism. In the analyses, we assumed a dominant effect of the poly morphism.

In the present study, G banding and FISH analysis were carried out on equal number of prenatal and abortus samples. The result was categorized in three age groups (ma ternal) as presented in the table below. FISH detected abnormalities were significantly lower in both prenatal and abortus samples, most likely due to its limitation on structural changes. Fetuses of mothers below 25 years sho wed maximum aberrations followed by the elderly mothers above 35 years of age. Early marriage and multiple conceptions at early age could be the underlying factor. In abortuses, similar trend was observed though frequen cy was high in all age groups.

Methods: In this case control association study, SSNHL cases (N,77) were included. Normal healthy subjects (N,100) were also recruited from the same region. Genotyping for MIF ( 173 G/C) polymorphism was carried out using polymerase chain reaction restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR RFLP) technique. Results: The association between MIF gene polymorphism in relation to hearing recovery after treatment with GC was investigated in patients with no improvement (N,38) in hearing loss compared with the group showing response to GC treatment (N,39).

24485,"C. T . Nicolau, Bucharest, Romania. Age related Macular Degeneration (AMD) is condition that usually affects older adults, finally leading to blindness. The risk factors for AMD include genetic background. TNF alpha polymorphisms were studied mostly in Asi an populations regarding their influence on susceptibility of AMD (1).We aimed to investigate two single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) of TNF ÃÂ± in AMD patients from Romania regarding their possible influence on their clinical characteristics. We assessed 275 subjects (67 AMD pati ents versus 208 healthy controls) for 308 G/A (rs1800629) and 857C/T (rs1799724) TNF alpha polymorphisms. These SPSs were genotyped using Real Time PCR technique (Taqman SNP Genotyping Assays C_2215707_10 and C_7514879_10 respectively, Applied Biosystems, USA). Statistical ana lyses, including Hardy Weinberg equilibrium (HWE), were performed by using the SNPStats web tool for the analysis of association studies; values Ã¢ÂÂ¤0.05 were considered significant. The distribution of both TNF ÃÂ± polymorphisms were in HWE in all studied groups. The frequencies of minor alleles 308A and 857T and were similar in AMD patients and controls (0.07/0.12 and 0.25/0.20, respectively). The investigated SNPs show no significant difference regarding the allele carria ge or genotype frequency between AMD and control subjects. Three main haplotypes were constructed ( 308G/ 857C, 308G/ 857T and 308A/ 857C). There was found no significant association between any of these haplotype and AMD (global interaction p value , 0.22). Conclusion: TNF alpha polymorphisms ( 857 C/T and 308 G/A) seems to not influence susceptibility of AMD. These results should be confirmed on larger patientsÃ¢ÂÂ cohort. Bibliography:1.

24486,"Medical and population genetic study of nonsyndromic hearing loss (NSHL) is done in Cherkessk, an urban settlement in the Republic of Karachay Cher kessia (Russia) (RKC). Connexins genes GJB2 and GJB6 are the most relevant in NSHL etiology. Up to date more than 200 pathogenic mutations asso ciated with NSHL and numerous polymorphisms with unclear clinical con sequences are detected in the GJB2 gene. In this study 87 RKC patients with NSHL have been examined for GJB2 coding region mutations and two GJB6 gene large deletions: DEL (GJB6 D13S1830) and DEL (GJB6 D13S1854).24 RKC patients are homozygous and 7 heterozygous for 35delG mutation in the GJB2 gene. The frequency of the 35delG mutation in total patients sample is 31.61%. The mutation 313del14 is revealed in NSHL patients from RKC (1.19%; n,2). Four sequencing variants noted as neutral poly morphisms are detected: c.79G>A (n,2), c.341G>A (n,1), c.186C > T (n,1) and c.457G>A (n,1). Pathogenic significance of the change c.457G>A is am biguous (Matos T .D., 2011). In one case the polymorphic variants c.341G>A and c.79G>A compose a known haplotype. Neither but the 35delG mutation in the GJB2 gene, nor two large deletions in the GJB6 gene are detected. 16 out of 87 NSHL patients are Karachays. Only one Karachay patient has the mutation 35delG in homozygousity (6.25%). Screening of 136 healthy Ka rachays from the urban settlement Cherkessk (272 chromosomes) reveals one heterozygous carrier of the 35delG mutation in the GJB2 gene. Low po pulation frequency of this mutation (0,368%) correspondes to low frequen cy among Karachay NSHL patients.

24487,"Introduction: Cataracts are one of the leading causes of blindness in humans. To date, there are 22 genes, mutations in which are responsible for conge nital cataract development. Mutations in the ÃÂ±A crystallin (CRYAA) gene are one of the most frequent causes of congenital cataract. Different mutations in these gene lead to the development of distinct cataract phenotypes. The aim of the study was to analyze the CRYAA gene in patients from Bashkorto stan Republic affected with congenital cataract. Objective: DNA samples of 40 unrelated patients with isolated form of here ditary congenital cataract from Bashkortostan Republic were analyzed. Methodology: The analysis was performed by direct sequencing of coding regions of the CRYAA gene. Results: In three unrelated families we identified two new mutations which hadnÃ¢ÂÂt been described previously c.253C>T (p. Leu85Phe) and c.291C>G (p. His97Gln). In a family with p. Leu85Phe mutation we found autosomal dominant congenital nuclear cataract associated with microphthalmia and microcornea, as well as strabismus and nystagmus developed later. Patients from two families with p. His97Gln mutation demonstrated isolated form of autosomal dominant congenital nuclear cataract. The total contribution of CRYAA gene mutations to the development of congenital hereditary cataract in the investigated region was 7.5 %.Conclusion: Thus, two previously undescribed structural changes in the gene CRYAA were detected in hereditary congenital cataract patients from Bashkortostan Republic. To determine their functional significance further investigations are required. The study was supported by RFBR grant (14 04 97007_r_povolgie_a).",2015

It is an uncommon condition affecting about 1/4,000 people in the USA and 1 5/10,000 in Italy. The term Ã¢ÂÂpigmentosaÃ¢ÂÂ deals with the characteristic appearance of abnormal areas of pigment into the retina. Degeneration induces a slow and progressive death in photoreceptors and retinal pigment epithelium, losing ability to transmit brain the visual infor mations. Today about 50 RP causative genes are known 1. We focused our attention on RP1, encoding a microtubule associated protein (MAP) needed for molecule trafficking between inner and outer segment of rods. We chose this gene due to its pathways correlations with congenital adrenal hyperpla sia (CAH) ones, pathology that affects the proband of a Sicilian RP affected family (9 members). We carried out a case control study regarding this family vs a control group of 200 healthy sicilian donors. The association of 5 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of RP1 exon 4 and its 3Ã¢ÂÂ UTR with RP family phenotype was investigated . Material and Methods: Genotyping was performed by PCR RFLP (Polyme rase Chain Reaction Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism) and di rect sequencing. Results and Conclusions: Data obtained highlight the fundamental role of a haplotype, inferred by all analyzed RP1 polymorphisms suggesting a pos sible genotype phenotype correlation between these SNPs coexistence and query disease. 1 Zhao L. et al, Next generation sequencing based molecular diagnosis of 82 retinitis pigmentosa probands from Northern Ireland, Hum Genet. 2015; 134 (2):217 30",2015
24489,"Hearing loss is one of the most common deficiencies at birth and is the most common disorder worldwide. One in about 500 newborns has permanent bilateral deafness. Epidemiological studies have shown that 50 60% of deaf ness cases have genetically causes and the mutations at the DFNB1 locus containing two genes GJB2 and GJB6 account for over half of non syn dromic hearing loss cases. Thus, our aim is to provide an updated spectrum of the GJB2 and GJB6 genes mutations in Romanian population in order to ensure an adequate approach. Our studies (350 normal hearing persons and 125 children with non syn dromic hearing loss) based on molecular techniques (ARMS PCR, PCR mul tiplex and DNA sequencing) found a carrier rate of 3.14 in Romanian popu lation for 35delG GJB2 gene mutation. Analysis of the GJB2 gene revealed that about 50% of hearing impaired children presented 35delG mutation. The second mutant allele in the GJB2 gene was c.71G>A found in homo or heterozygous forms as well, followed by c. 23+1G>A and c.380G>A mutati ons with lower frequencies. Also we found that the mutations in the GJB6 gene are not significant for Romanian population. Considering all these aspects, genetic counseling should be offered in case of marriages between individuals with GJB2 mutations in their families. The genetic testing has also biomedical implications and defines new guidelines for clinical practice. Neonatal screening could provide an early diagnosis al lowing appropriate intervention and increasing the chances of recovery of hearing in children.

24490,"Introduction: PDS (SLC26A4 ) has been mapped on 7q22 31.1 and is the se cond most common gene accounting for hereditary hearing loss (HL), after GJB2 . The product of PDS is pendrin, a transmembrane anion transporter. Mutations of PDS are associated with recessive non syndromic HL (DFNB4) and Pendred syndrome (PS). To date only a little is known about PDS mutati ons in Iran. In the present study mutations of this gene were investigated in Iranian subjects with HL to identify prevalence and types of PDS mutations in these patients. Methods: Thirty unrelated Iranian families with hereditary hearing loss and without GJB2 mutations were investigated for linkage to DFNB4 using 4 short tandem repeat (STR) markers. Following that, DNA sequencing of all 21 exons, their adjacent intronic sequences and promoter of PDS was carried out for mutation detection in families showed linkage. Clinical phe notype of patients with mutation was studied with temporal bone CT scan, thyroid ultrasonography and thyroid hormone assays. Results: Three families were linked to DFNB4 locus. Sequencing was clari fied 4 PDS mutations (c.65 66insT , c.2106delG, c.863 864insT , c.881 882 delAC) in exons 2, 19 and 7. Clinical phenotype investigations showed PS in these three families.

24491,"Hearing loss is the most common sensory impairment of human. At least 50% to 60% of childhood hearing loss was inherited. Identifying the genetic basis of deafness is a critical procedure for the clinical evaluation of deaf persons and their families. To date, 136 deafness loci have been identified, and about 90 genes have been cloned. However, the mutation frequency of many genes for HL is not clear, and the causes for majority deafness patients remained unknown. It is critical to develop an effective, comprehensive ge netic testing platform for hearing loss. We designed a panel including 307 deafness genes and the chondriogene, 76 samples with identified deafness gene mutations and YH genome DNA sample were used for the validation. And then screenings were carried out for a total of 147 patients with hearing loss, by target capture and NGS. For the 77 validation samples, the average depth of the targeted regions was more than 250 fold. The sensitivity and specificity for the mutation detec tion was 100%.For patients with non syndromic hearing loss, the positive rates were 56.6% (56/99) for early onset hearing loss and 39.5% (17/43) for late onset deaf ness, and candidate mutations were identified in 2 out of 5 patients with syndromic hearing loss.

24493,"Introduction: Genetic epidemiological examination of isolated populations can often reveal relative abundance of hereditary conditions, which are rare in other populations. Rural regions of Tatarstan (Russia) are characterized by high occurrence of isolated hereditary hearing loss. Here we describe a fa mily with recurrent postlingual hearing loss: the proband (woman) and one of her four sisters have hearing loss that manifested postlingually. Affected sister of proband has two children; one of them also developed progressive deafness. Molecular diagnosis in the family was determined with the aid of whole exome sequencing (WES) in conjunction with clinical observations. Materials and Methods: During the field expeditions in Tatarstan, medical genetic examination and peripheral blood collection of familial cases of hea ring loss was performed. Isolated DNA was routinely screened for frequent pathogenic mutations in GJB2 gene. WES was performed on Illumina HiSeq 2000 at 85ÃÂ depth. Verification of mutations identified by WES was done by Sanger sequencing. Results: Screening for frequent mutations failed to identify common cause of observed condition. Among 60 genes associated with hearing loss, WES revealed an undescribed heterozygous mutation p. R848Q in MYO7A gene, located at a highly conserved position. The known clinical presentations and mode of inheritance described for MYO7A related hearing loss correspon ded well to our case. Conclusions: Combination of WES with detailed analysis of clinical data enabled to identify causative mutation in a family with autosomal dominant hearing loss. This approach can enhance the current diagnostic pipeline for this condition. This work was partially funded by RFBR grant 14 04 00525.",2015
24494,"IntroductionChildhood cataract (CC) is the leading global cause of lifelong visual loss. Around 50% of cases have a genetic aetiology. Inborn errors of metabo lism represent a subset of causes, a number of which are treatable, making early identification crucial. Extreme genetic and phenotypic heterogeneity impedes the traditionally complex clinical/genetic/biochemical diagnostic pathway. Next generation sequencing (NGS) technologies have transformed the diagnostic approach. MethodsWe have successfully implemented an NGS target enrichment to screen 115 CC associated genes. A close collaborative effort has enabled the develop ment of an efficient diagnostic pipeline linking detailed clinical phenotyping, high through put sequencing, data storage, bioinformatics and scientific in terpretation to create a linear care pathway from patient to report. ResultsCataract targeted NGS has enabled a diagnosis rate of 75% in CC pati ents; 18% of cases are attributable to metabolic disease, indicating a hig her prevalence than the literature suggests. Six different inborn errors of metabolism were identified, including apparently rare conditions such as stomatin deficient cryohydrocytosis, lathosterolosis and cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis. DiscussionCataract targeted NGS streamlines the care pathway of CC patients, redu cing the requirement for a battery of diagnostic tests habitual to the pre genomic era. Precise diagnosis of metabolic conditions for which CC is a primary indication, permits i) initiation of early therapeutic intervention to prevent disease progression ii) delineation of rare/complex phenotypes and iii) greatly improves diagnostic outcomes attributable to the implementati on of stratified genomic medicine.",2015

Congenital cataract can occur in association with a large number of different metabolic diseases or genetic anomalies including intellectual disability and microcephaly. Here is the first report of gene identification in inherited con genital cataracts associated only with intellectual disability and microce phaly. Materials and Methods: Five members (3 normal, 2 affected) of a 4 ge neration consanguineous Tunisian family with autosomal recessive conge nital cataract associated with intellectual disability and microcephaly were screened. A whole genome scan was performed with polymorphic micro satellites and homozygous regions were analyzed with integrated Systems Tool for Eye gene Discovery (iSyTE). Selected genes were analyzed by direct sequencing. Results: Using whole genome scanning, we identified six runs of homozy gosity shared among affected members. Analysis of these regions by iSyTE allowed us to select 3 genes (RGS6 , PCNX, and P4HA1 ) according to their expression in 3 critical stages of lens development. Upon screening for mu tations by sequencing analysis, we found a novel mutation in RGS6, the spli ce acceptor variant c.1369 1G>C that was not previously reported in conge nital cataract phenotypes. Bioinformatics analysis suggested a deleterious effect of this mutation on protein structure and function. Conclusion: This is the first report of a splice site mutation of a novel lens specific gene RGS6 in a phenotype associating AR congenital cataract, intel lectual disability and microcephaly.

The most severely affected fetuses display enlarged echogenic kidneys, oligohydramnios and pulmonary hypoplasia. Arterial hypertension affects up to 80% of children with ARPKD and usually develops within the first months of life. ARPKD is caused by mutations in the PKHD1 gene loca ted on chromosome 6p12 and extending over 470 kb of genomic sequence. The severity and early manifestation of ARPKD make parents of affected child seek reliable prenatal diagnosis to guide future family planning. Even though the standard second trimester US imaging is still state of the art method of ARPKD diagnosis, it is often not early enough for pregnancy ter mination. For that reason early prenatal diagnosis is feasible only by mole cular genetic analysis. Here we present 2 Czech families with severe form of ARPKD causing perinatal death of index patient. In these families amplicon based next generation sequencing and MLPA (multiplex ligation dependent probe amplification) analyses of the PKHD1 gene in fatally affected child were performed and so facilitated quick prenatal genetic diagnosis in next pregnancy when only positive amplicons with found mutation were analy zed, and therefore helped the diagnosis of ARPKD based most importantly on ultrasound screening.

Introduction: Chronic gluten intolerance (celiac disease) occurs in geneti cally predisposed individuals. It is a multifactorial disease, which is affec ted by several environmental, immunological and genetic factors. The main factor affecting the genetic predisposition for celiac disease is HLA II. class DQ2 and DQ8.Materials and Methods: In the group of patients, there were 200 women and 80 men (average , 38,5 years), who were examined for the HLA system II. class, heterodimers HLA DQ2 and HLA DQ8. To identify major haplotypes in the context of celiac disease, we used the method of Reverse Dot Blot with the aid of a commercial kit CeliacStrip (Opegen).Results: The frequency of the haplotype HLA DQ2 cis in women was 20.30% and 12.14% in men in any given group of patients. Women with DQ2 trans Hp2 were 12.38% and 7.6% men. In the statistical evaluation of the pati ents we did not find statistically significant differences in relation to gender, among tested men and women. Conclusion: In comparison to the risk of haplotypes in women and men in this group of patients, it was found that women have a slightly higher preva lence for the risk of haplotype HLA",2015
24502,"Background: Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) is a complex endocrine disorder with a pronounced genetic predisposition. Pineal hormone me latonin could modulate reproduction pattern in several animal species, and disturbed melatonin secretion has been described in women with hyperandrogenic states. Nevertheless, the role of melatonin receptor poly morphisms for the development of PCOS is poorly investigated. Therefore, the present study aimed to investigate the relationships between melatonin receptor 1B (MTNR1B) polymorphisms rs10830962 and rs10830963 and clinical features of the syndrome. Materials and methods: Genotyping for MTNR1B rs10830962 and rs10830963 was performed in 59 patients with PCOS by PCR RFLP analy sis. Results: MTNR1B rs10830963 G allele was related to elevated levels of DHEAS in the investigated patients (ÃÂ,0.007), while no significant associa tions with testosterone levels, presence of hirsutism or obesity were found (p>0.05). MTNR1B rs10830963 G allele was associated with a significant ly lower LH to FSH ratio in obese PCOS patients (p,0.026). No significant associations between MTNR1B rs10830962 and PCOS clinical or hormonal features were established (p>0.05).Conclusions:The present results suggest that MTNR1B rs10830963 but not rs10830962 polymorphism could influence the clinical expression of PCOS in women.

24503,"Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF) is a disease that is characterized by the deposition of an excessive degree of myofibroblast cells and extracellular matrix components in the lower respiratory tract and lung interstitium. Me dian survival is 3 years after initial diagnosis. Prevalence rate varies from 14 to 43 per 100 000 people. Today, it is thought that recurrent epithelial damage and aberrant wound healing are the basis of IPF pathogenesis, re sulting in the accumulation of fibroblasts in the lung. In addition, coagulati on, apoptosis, angiogenesis pathway disorders, oxidative damage, and most recently epithelialÃ¢ÂÂmesenchymal transition (EMT) are implicated in the pa thogenesis of this disease. Major aim of our study is to show the fundamen tal role of osteopontin, Twist and Wnt 5a genes in IPF pathogenesis which these genes have been implicated by several studies in EMT and to show whether the suppression of these genes could be effective for IPF treatment examined. First of all, we treated A549 cell line with different dose of TGF ÃÂ² to create EMT . We showed that after TGF ÃÂ² treatment, E cadherin expressi on is markedly decreased, on the contrary, Vimentin expression increased showing EMT .

24504,"Objective: Although polymorphisms in suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 (SOCS3) was reported to be related to obesity, metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes in various adult studies, there is a lack of data in children. In this study, we examined eight reported polymorphisms of SOCS3 in obese Turkish children with and without metabolic syndrome and compared the results with that of controls. Methods: 148 obese and 63 age and sex matched control children were en rolled in the study. Genotyping procedure was carried out by PCR sequen cing protocole. Results: The frequency of rs2280148 polymorphism was significantly high er in obese children with metabolic syndrome than that of the control group, whereas the frequency of rs8064821 polymorphism was significantly high er in obese children with metabolic syndrome than that of obese children without metabolic syndrome. Conclusion: The significant association of certain SOCS3 polymorphisms with obesity parameters in both metabolic syndrome and metabolic syn drome related insulin resistance, hypertension, and fatty liver suggest that polymorphisms in this gene may play a role in the pathogenesis of metabolic syndrome and also that they can be potentially used as a marker for attenu ated or agressive disease.",2015

Its classical simple virilizing (SV) form leads to virilization of external genitalia in newborn females and pseudoprecocious puberty in both sexes, due to re active androgen overproduction. SV CAH is usually associated with I172N missense mutation at the CYP21A2 gene. Method: Two sisters were diagnosed as classical SV CAH at the age 7 and 9 years respectively by standard clinical and biochemical procedures. They had virilization, and high 17OHP (>75 nmol/L) on ACTH stimulation test. Molecular detection of nine most common point CYP21A2 mutations in the patients and family members, using the PCR/ACRS method was performed. They received hydrocortisone for several years. At 35 and 37 years they were referred to the gynecologist due to oligomenorrhea, hirsutism, and in fertility. After hormonal preparation IVF was performed in the older sister with no success. Results: P30L/II72N genotype was observed in both SV patients. The I172N mutation in the heterozygote state was observed in their other two sisters, 43 and 28 years old, without clinical manifestation of CAH. Father was he terozygote for P30L mutation. The deceased mother has not been analyzed. She was probably a carrier of I172N. Conclusion: Simple virilizing CAH appears with virilization causing oligo menorrhoea and infertility later in life. Molecular diagnosis is essential to provide the correct diagnosis and allows appropriate clinical and genetic counseling.

Objectives:To determine the pre valence of CD in a pediatric population with autoimmune hepatitis(AIH) and autoimmune thyroid disorders(AITD) and in control lot and to assess the clinical forms of presentation and the HLA polymorphism in all cases. Methods:We screened for CD 74 children with AITD(lot 1), 62 children with AIH(lot 2) and 60 healthy children. In patients with at least one positive autoantibody for CD, intestinal biopsy was performed. All children under went HLA typing for DQ2/DQ8.Results:CD prevalence was 7%(5 patients) in lot 1, 6%(4 patients) in lot 2 and 0 in control lot. There werenÃ¢ÂÂt significant differences between the frecquency of CD cases among children with AITD and AIH( p>0,05).Most of the cases presented as silent CD(78%).All child ren diagnosed with CD presented DQ2/DQ8 haplotype.20% of the control subjects associated heterozygous DQ2 alleles. From 69 children with AITD/without CD, only 3 patients(4%) presented heterozygous DQ2.From 58 children with AIH and negative results for CD, 37 patients(64%) associated homo or heterozygous DQ2/DQ8 alleles. Conclusions:Recommending AITD and AIH as selection parameters for CD screening in asymptomatic child ren is justified by the high frequency of gluten enteropaty obtained in this study(7% and 6% respectively).CD and AIH share selected combinations of genes coding for class II HLA, which could explain their coexistence.

Aim: To present the case of a seven months baby girl diagnosed with CF at 3 months of age, who presented at 5 months with PBS. Case report: A history of repeated pneumonia, diarrhea and failure to thrive lead to perfor ming a sweat test, which was positive (NaCl 110mM/l Nanoduct system). We also performed a molecular genetic analysis of the CFTR gene for 29 mu tations ( kit Elucigene CF 29). It revealed a heterozygous state for F508del CFTR. The other allele remained unknown. Nutritional therapy and pul monary therapy was started. The infant was put on an enzyme replacement therapy. Despite the treatment and the familyÃ¢ÂÂs compliance, her failure to thrive continued. At 5 months she presented with PBS. After the acute phase was resolved, we started supplementing with an oral NaCl solution and the result was an improved growth. The sweat test remained positive after her growth normalised (85mM/l). The kit we used identifies the most common mutations for the Central and Eastern European area. Thus, we performed a wider molecular genetic analysis and the results are pending. Conclusions: The sweat test remains pathognomonic for diagnosing CF. PBS delays the improvement of the nutritional status. Regarding the future pregnancies of the couple, the identification of the second allele is of most importance for offering a proper genetic counseling.",2015

Even though the nuclear genome association with UC has been intensely investi gated, the role of the second genome, the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), has received far less attention. Objective: To perform a comprehensive analysis of the mtDNA contribution to UC susceptibility. Materials and Methods: The association of mitochondrial single nucleotide polymorphisms (mtSNPs) and haplogroups with UC was tested in 488 ca ses and 833 controls of European ancestry from the NIDDK IBD Genetics Consortium Ulcerative Colitis Genome Wide Association Study available through dbGaP (study accession number phs000345.v1.p1) and from stu dies 64 and 65 deposited in the Illumina Genotype Control Database. Results: No evidence of population stratification could be detected using 218 AIMs for European Americans. 8 mtSNPs were significantly asso ciated with UC but only A10550G in MT ND4L would survive Bonferroni correction (Punadj,1.40E 07, ORG[95%CI],4.52[2.46 8.30], 10550G al lele: 8.1% of patients and 1.9% of controls). A10550G was equally asso ciated in pairwise conditional analyses with the top GWAS SNPs (7.55E 07<Pcond,unadj<4.42E 06), suggesting that it constitutes an indepen dent risk factor from nuclear encoded susceptibility loci.

Data averages in 98% aligned reads, with all exons (except 3 and16) were covered with the mean read depth 1000x. Alternative allele variant frequency was on average 50% and we didnÃÂ´t detect any mosaic forms of mutations. Within the regions covered by MiSeq reads, all anticipated variants were detected. In exon 24 we found novel mutation c.4272C>A which has not been detec ted by Sanger DNA sequencing. Variant calling was performed applying Illu mina Variant Studio. Resequencing of the entire coding sequence with NGS platform MiSeq/Illumina increases the sensitivity of mutation detection and is cost effective, especially when samples are multiplexed. Our experience indicates that NGS could be used in routine diagnostics of CF negative for commonly utilised assays.

Sequencing of the fibrillin 1 (FBN1) gene has a 70 90% clinical sensitivity in patients with Marfan syndrome. We developed a rapid and reliable diagnostic workflow for FBN1 gene analysis by combining Sanger and next generation sequencing (NGS) methods. Exons and flanking regions of the FBN1 gene were amplified in 65 ampli cons. Homopolymer containing exons (n,16) were sequenced using Sanger technology while all other amplicons were sequenced using NGS (Roche GS Junior), where coverage criteria was above 40x. Pathogenic mutations de tected by NGS method were confirmed by Sanger sequencing. Twenty three families were tested. Marfan syndrome was confirmed in 10/23 unrelated patients. Eight missense and two small scale deletion/duplication mutations were detected among which six were novel alte rations (c.5196delC, c.2585G>A, c.6032G>C, c.3038G>T , c.2288G>A and c.2272_2275dupTCAA).

24523,"Introduction: Cleidocranial dysplasia (CCD) is a rare autosomal dominant disorder caused by haploinsufficiency of Runt related transcription factor RUNX2, which affects osteoblast function during endesmal osssification (and other processes), leading to clavicle hypo(a)plasia, persistent skull sutures, dental anomalies and other problems. In a patient with clinical dia gnosis of CCD, we searched for the causal mutation in RUNX2.Materials and Methods: All 9 exons of RUNX2 (longest isoform, NM_001024630.3) were amplified by PCR from genomic DNA isolated from peripheral blood and subjected to Sanger sequencing. For splicing detection, peripheral blood RNA was reversely transcribed and amplified with primers spanning exons 4 6.Results: Patient is a 42 year old female diagnosed during childhood with CCD for bilateral aplasia of clavicles, impaired skull ossification, persistence of deciduous teeth, flatfoot and hip dysplasia. Sequencing of genomic DNA revealed G >A substitution at postition +5 in intron 5, not listed in dbSNP . Splicing prediction by three different tools showed modest drop in score, so we tested actual splicing by RT PCR. Exon 5 was skipped in about 30% of transcripts, regarded to be enough to cause pathology. Interestingly, skip ping exon 5 (105bp) does not lead to a frameshift. The resulting protein lacking part of the Runt domain and a nuclear localization signal may be therefore translated and may potentially represent a dominant negative. Conclusion: In a patient with typical cleidocranial syndrome manifestation, a novel splicing variant was found in intron 5 donor splice site.

To elucidate the disease mechanism underlying OI in the dog model, we ap plied a range of biochemical assays to mutant and control skin fibroblasts as well as on bone samples. Type I collagen synthesized by mutant cells had decreased electrophoretic mobility. Procollagen was retained intracellularly with concomitant dilation of ER cisternae and activation of the ER stress response marker GRP78. In line with the migration shift detected on SDS PAGE of cell culture collagen, extracts of bone collagen from the OI dog showed a similar mobility shift and on tandem mass spectrometry the chains were post translationally overmodified. The bone collagen had a higher content of pyridinoline than control dog bone. The SERPINH1 mutation in this naturally occurring model of OI impairs how HSP47 acts as a chaperone in the ER.

There were no other cardiological and abdominal assess ment findings. On the basis of the clinical features and laboratory findings, we performed whole exome sequencing for one subject. Materials and Methods: Two affected children were characterized by dys morphological findings as narrow forehead, hypertelorism, pectus excava tum, prominent eyes. There were unique constellation of radiographic fin dings including biconcave vertebrae, coxa vara, enlarged humerus diaphysis and femur metaphysis in both affected children that the boy had more severe features.

24537,"Purpose: Human low molecular weight salivary mucin (MUC7), also known as MG2, is a small, secreted glycoprotein that functions to help salivary de fence against oral bacteria by masking their surface adhesins and thereby inhibiting colonization. In this study, we aimed to identify the N Terminal region of MUC7 gene polymorphisms between individuals with and without caries. Methods: 44 Healthy dental students were included in this study. 24 of them were classified to have dental caries (DMF T,5,6) according to the World Health Organisation (WHO) and 20 of them were caries free (DMF T,0). Salivary total protein was measured by Lowry method, salivary buffer capa city (SBF) by EricssonÃ¢ÂÂs method. Saliva flow rate and pH was also calculated. Genotyping procedure was carried out by PCR direct sequencing. Results: We detected a transversition of C to G, which causes a change aspa ragine to lysine in codon 80 (N80K). This alteration was found 33,3% and 42,1% in with and without caries groups, respectively. There was no stati stically significant difference between caries and non caries group in the terms of biochemical and genetic results. Conclusion: The SNP found in this study may be a specific polymorphism affecting Turkish population. Further studies with more numbers of indivi duals are necessary in order to clarify this finding.",2015

Although a lot of progress has been made in understanding the causes of hypodontia, knowledge of the exact aethiolo gy remains poor. Genetic studies discovered mutations in 3 genes in patients with familial hypodontia or oligodontia: MSX1, PAX9 and AXIN2.The patient, a 22 years old male was referred to the Department of Orth odontics, University of Dentistry TÃÂ®rgu Mures, with a chief complaint of missing permanent teeth. Extraoral examination revealed a well balanced face with normal facial profile and normal skeletal dental base relations. Intraoral examination revealed a mixed dentition. Radiographic exami nation confirmed that the following teeth were developmentally missing: 4.2,3.3,4.1,1.2,1.5.A multidisciplinary team involving an orthodontist and a prosthodontists established the treatment plan and the clinical management of this case. A combined orthodontic restorative surgical approach was adopted. The aim of the orthodontic treatment was dental allignement and creation of space for placement of implants. Orthodontic treatment was conducted using a fixed staight wire appliance for 12 months. Implants were placed and after five months the final prosthetic restauration was performed. Young patients with congenitally missing teeth need an early refferal to a dentistry team for optimal management. This case report shows the need for a multidisciplinary team approach for the establishment of the treat ment plan. The two main objectives for patients with hypodontia, namely improved esthetics and restoration of masticatory function, were achieved in this case.",2015

Moreover, FN1 and TNC glycoproteins seems to have a role in the tendon healing. No previous study evaluated the mRNA expres sion of these genes in tendons of patients with rotator cuff tears. We evalu ated TGFÃÂ²1, TGFÃÂ²R1, GDF5, KFL6, FN1 and TNC expression in 28 ruptured supraspinatus tendon samples of patients with rotator cuff tears and in 8 normal supraspinatus tendon samples by reverse transcription quantitati ve polymerase chain reaction. HPRT1, TBP and ACTB were selected as refe rence genes for gene expression normalization. We observed that FN1, TNC and TGFÃÂ²R1 expression was increased in tendon samples of cases compa red with controls (p,0.002, p,0.025, p,0.020, respectively). Increased FN1 (p,0.025) and TNC (p,0.014) expression was detected in smokers in rela tion to non smoker patients.

There are two distinct pheno types: BPES type I, which is associated with female infertility or premature menopause due to ovarian resistance to gonadotropins, whereas in type II only eyelid abnormalities are present. Mutations in the forkhead transcrip tion factor 2 (FOXL2) gene are responsible for both types of BPES. The pur pose of this study was to identify mutations in FOXL2 in Iranian patients with BPES. The peripheral blood was collected from the patients of two families and genomic DNA was extracted. Direct sequencing of all exons of FOXL2 gene was performed. Two mutations in FOXL2 were identified in two familial cases c.102 103 ins A (p.

These muta tions cause truncated protein and envisaged to have severe phenotypic im pact in harmony with type I phenotype seen in the patients. The role of FOXL2 gene in the etiology of infertility is still unclear, but seve ral studies suggested that it plays a central role in follicle development. Our results expand the spectrum of FOXL2 mutations and confirm the mutations association with eyelid abnormalities and female infertility.

24541,"Introduction: Pycnodysostosis (PKND) is a rare, autosomal recessive disea se characterized by short stature, severe bone fragility, exophthalmus and oral manifestations such as micrognathia. It usually demonstrates typical craniofacial deformities, such as hypoplastic midface, anterior cross bite, grooved palate and dental crowding. The aim of this case report is to in vestigate the role of cathepsin K (CTSK) for pycnodysostosis in an effected Turkish family. Material Method: Family applied to Marmara University, Department of Pe dodontology for treatment of PKND. Three of five siblings had PKND whe reas the other two siblings were PKND unaffected. All the siblingsÃ¢ÂÂ detailed clinical and radiological examinations were performed. Results: Taking into consideration the fragility in these patients, appropriate restorative treatments and protective applications were preferred. Patients were given oral hygiene education. Recall visits occurred in every 3 months during the 18 month follow up period. For mutational analysis, genomic DNA was isolated from buccal cells.

Conclusions: Early diagnosis and treatment is important with PKND pati ents, since bone fractures easily occur during dental treatment and limited mouth opening makes it difficult to access the treated area. Frequent recalls should be planned for PKND patients. Regular oral care and early preven tive treatments ensure the patients a better life quality. Genetically, all the affected members carried L7P variation as homozygous state, whereas un affected had the heterozygous state of the same condition. Conclusively, we suggest that L7P mutation is important for the onset of this anomaly.",2015

OA is mainly characterized by the gradual loss of the articular cartilage, particularly affecting the knee, hip, spine, hand and foot. Although the mul tifactorial nature of the vast majority of OA cases is well recognized, genetic risk factors have been found to be strong determinants of the disease. About 50% of hip and hand OA may be genetically determined. However, current ly, only few genetic alterations responsible for OA determinism have been identified mostly in genes involved in the cartilage extracellular matrix. These alterations have been mainly detected in patients with syndromic early onset OA like pseudoachondroplasia, multiple epiphyseal dysplasia or spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia tarda. The EXORHUM project is based on the recruitment of a well clinically cha racterized cohort of patients with non syndromic early onset OA. The main aim is to identify new genetic alterations, exclusive to primary OA in patients with a familial presentation, strongly suggestive of a genetic determinism. Exome sequencing will be performed on two distant affected family mem bers without known alterations. The sub aim is to assess the prevalence of known mutations in primary non syndromic OA. In conclusion, the EXORHUM project will help us to improve the understan ding of molecular processes involved in pathogenesis of OA and to better un derstand the complexity of OA.

MD may also be present in monosomy X and, more rarely, in other monogenic disorders such as Albright hereditary osteodystrophy in association to brachydactyly. We report a 48 year old woman with MD, short stature (148 cm but in her target height) and premature ovarian failure (age at last menses 38 years) in the absence of brachydactyly, other endocrine anomalies, or abnormal skin pigmentation. SHOX gene mutations and rearrangements were excluded by molecular techniques. Conventional cytogenetic analysis demonstrated eu ploid female karyotype with a deletion of the long arm of one X chromosome in band q24Ã¢ÂÂqter. To better characterize the rearrangement, we performed array CGH analysis that showed a deletion extending about 33 Mb with bre akpoints in Xq25Ã¢ÂÂq28.

Congenital tooth agenesis is caused by mutations in the MSX1, PAX9 , WN T10a, or AXIN2 genes. Here, we report a Japanese family with nonsyndro mic tooth agenesis caused by a novel nucleotide substitution in the intronic region between exons 1 and 2 of the MSX1 gene. Because the mutation is located 9Ã¢ÂÂbp before exon 2 (c.452 9G>A), we speculated that the nucleoti de substitution would generate an abnormal splice site. Using cDNA analy sis of an immortalized patient blood cell, we confirmed that an additional 7 nucleotide sequence was inserted at the splice junction between exons 1 and 2 (c.451_452insCCCTCAG). The consequent frameshift generated a homeodomain truncated MSX1 (p. R151fsX20). We then showed a subcel lular localization of the mutant MSX1 in the cytoplasm of transfected COS7 cells, suggesting deletion of the nuclear localization signal, which is map ped to the MSX1 homeodomain. These results indicate that this novel intro nic nucleotide substitution is the cause of tooth agenesis in this family. To date, most MSX1 variants isolated from patients with tooth agenesis involve single amino acid substitutions in the highly conserved homeodomain or deletion mutants caused by frameshift or nonsense mutations. We here re port a rare case of an intronic mutation of the MSX1 gene responsible for human tooth agenesis. In addition, the missing tooth patterns were slight ly but significantly different between an affected monozygotic twin pair of this family, showing that epigenetic or environmental factors also affect the phenotypic variations of missing teeth among patients with nonsyndromic tooth agenesis caused by an MSX1 haploinsufficiency.",2015
24546,"Introduction: Marfan syndrome (MFS) is a connective tissue disorder caused by mutations in FBN1. It affects ~1/5,000 people and 75% of cases are in herited. A spectrum of mutations are reported to cause disease; however, to date there have been no reports of large intragenic duplications causing MFS. Here, we report a de novo duplication of exons 36 46 of FBN1 in a fetus with bilateral talipes, enlarged cisterna magna, an unfolded aorta and long, thin, overlapping fingers. Methods: Sanger sequencing and MLPA of exons 1 65 of FBN1 in the fetal sample, and MLPA analysis of both parental samples were completed. Results: Sequencing analysis of the entire coding region of FBN1 did not de tect any pathogenic mutations. However, FBN1 MLPA analysis detected a he terozygous duplication of exons 36 46. Neither unaffected parent was found to be heterozygous for this mutation, supporting likely pathogenicity of this change. Conclusion: To our knowledge, intragenic duplications involving multiple exons of FBN1 have not been previously reported in humans. If this is an in tragenic tandem duplication it would be predicted to cause a frameshift and therefore would likely be pathogenic. Although intragenic duplications have not been previously described in hu mans, the tsk mouse has an intragenic tandem duplication of FBN1 (exons 17 30) and demonstrates cardiac hypertrophy, tight skin and skeletal features associated with MFS (Siracusa et al (1996) Genome Research 6:300 313).This novel duplication is likely to be the cause of the abnormalities seen in this fetus, and expands the range of pathogenic mutation types detected in MFS.",2015

Variants in the 3Ã¢ÂÂ UTR may regulate synthesis of the ÃÂ±1(V) chain and type V collagen pro duction thereby influencing the mechanical properties of the tissues. Func tional differences were established between the COL5A1 3Ã¢ÂÂ UTR cloned from participants with a severe chronic Achilles tendinopathy (TEN) phenotype and healthy asymptomatic control individuals. Indeed, two major forms, the C and T allelic form, were identified and additional variants were shown to be associated with TEN. To further investigate these functional differences and to start mapping the regions responsible for the tendinopathic pheno type, skin biopsies from donors having a known genotype at rs12722 were taken and primary fibroblast cell lines were established to quantify COL5A1 and COL1A1 expression in a pilot study. Site directed mutants were genera ted for two implicated variants, namely rs12722 and rs71746744. Lastly, in preliminary RNA EMSAs, biotinylated C and T allelic RNA probes for a 57bp region were incubated with either nuclear/cytoplasmic protein extracts to investigate putative distinguishing RNA:RBP complex formation. An overall higher relative mRNA expression of both COL5A1 (p<0.001) and COL1A1 (p,0.0015) were observed in the presence of rs12722 TT genotype com pared to CC. Although the rs71746744 and rs12722 variants appeared to be functional, they did not independently contribute to the tendinopathic phenotype. However, a unique RNA:RBP complex was identified with the C allelic probe.

Very recently, mutations in the dentin matrix protein 1 (DMP1) gene were identified in patients with an extremely rare autosomal recessive form of HR (ARHR). To date, very few cases of these mutations were reported. Materials and methods: A Lebanese consanguineous family with 2 affected sisters was studied. Patients aged 45 and 47 years old presentedwith short stature, severe genu varum, cranial hyperostosis and a very high bone den sity that led to a diagnosis of a familial sclerosing bone dysplasia. Molecular analysis of known genes involved in osteopetrosis showed normal results. A combination of genotyping and exome sequencing was performed in order to elucidate the genetic basis of this pathology. Results: Biochemical analysis was consistent with normal serum calcium and 1 25(OH)2D levels, low to normal serum phosphorus and elevated PTH values.

The patient carries a heterozygous missense mutation c.682T>A (p.(Phe228Ile)) in the WNT10A gene.

The current analysis included 192 unrelated hypertensive patients, 261 patients with angiographically documented CAD (153 with myocardial in farction and 108 without myocardial infarction) and 496 population based controls. The CYP2C8*3and CYP2J2*7 polymorphisms were genotyped by TaqMan SNP Genotyping Assay (Applied Biosystems). PLINK version 1.07 was used for the statistical analysis. The frequency of 50T mutant allele of CYP2J2*7 was significantly higher in male with angiographically documented CAD without history of myocardial infarction (OR 2.16 95%CI 1.04 4.48 p,0.035) compared to population con trol group, but this association did not survive after Bonferroni correction (padj,0.07).

Here, we discuss the case of a family with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy where the generally used diagnostic approaches did not give enough in formation for a correct decision of implanting an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD). A 7 year old female child was transported to a critical care center after a short reanimation which was carried out after she had collapsed without prodromal signs during a regular physical activity. The fa ther had typical MRI signs for HCM while the motherÃ¢ÂÂs MRI did not show any change characteristic for HCM. The sudden cardiac death together with the diagnosed HCM indicated the implantation of ICD.

Genetic testing was offered to the family and we have identified two disease causing heterozygous mutations in the MYBPC3 gene (p. R495Q and p. S593fs*11) in the children. This information finally helped to make the decision of implanting ICD into both sisters as primary prevention, despite of the associated average of 25% complication rate of the procedure in children. Later, the father (carrying the p. R495Q mutation) also received an ICD after a 30 second collapse with unknown origin. Since the mother (carrying the p.

In total, we have detected 5 heteroplasmic transitions in 4 individuals (16.7%). In addition, common heteroplasmy in polycytosine tracts 16184 16193 and 302 309 has been registered in 17% and 70% patients, respectively. While comparing plaque and blood samples for each patient, 3 of the heteroplas mies were common for the plaque and blood of the individuals, whereas two heteroplasmic positions were detected only in the plaques, so they could be result of somatic mutations. The results support the assumption that athe rogenesis is accompanied by mtDNA damage. The study is supported by Russian Science Foundation, grant no. 14 15 00305.",2015
24557,"Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a rare disorder of the small pul monary arteries that determines proliferative and fibrotic changes charac terized by progressivity, leading to vessel blockage, right heart failure and death. The major gene associated to PAH, according to an autosomal domi nant inheritance pattern, is BMPR2 that encodes the Ã¢ÂÂbone morphogenetic protein receptor, type II (serine/threonine kinase)Ã¢ÂÂ. At our Cardiology Unit, a Center of Excellence for diagnosis and therapy of PAH, within the project concerning the BMPR2 screening in PAH patients, to date, we (LS, SG) en rolled 30 probands. The BMPR2 analysis by direct sequencing of the 13 co ding exons has been completed in 26 (19 female): 6 (23%) patients, 3 (43%) male and 3 (16%) female, showed a private mutation; these nucleotide chan ges were absent in dbSNP141, 1000Genomes and Exome Variant Server da taset. In four patients a BMPR2 haploinsufficiency is predictable, because the mutation leads to a premature termination codon; in other two were identified the mutations p.(Cys117Gly) (not described) and p.(Arg491Gln) (Deng Z et al., 2000) that, by use of Blastp, have been located within the con sensus CCX{4 5}CN (hydrophilic cysteine rich ligand binding domain) and in the Ã¢ÂÂCatalytic domain of the Serine/Threonine KinasesÃ¢ÂÂ, rispectively. The cysteine substitution in the ligand binding domain is plausibly causative of retention of the protein in the endoplasmic reticulum (Rudarakanchana N et al., 2002). This abstract describes preliminary data of the first Italian study aimed to characterize the genetic basis of PAH in a large number of patients; this will ensure a more focused and effective clinical management of PAH patients together with the goal to move toward application of personalized medicine.",2015

24560,"A. Reyman, PreÃÂ¡ov, Slovakia, 3Cardiology, Reimanus, PreÃÂ¡ov, Slovakia. Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is a primary myocardial disease and geneti cally heterogeneous disorder. It represents a major cause of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality and is characterized by systolic dysfunction, dilati on, and impaired contraction of the ventricles, often leading to chronic heart failure and eventually requiring cardiac transplantation. Mutations in both sarcomeric and cytoskeletal genes have been implicated in DCM. Recently, a GWAS study on DCM indicated that rs10927875 single nucleotide poly morphism (SNP) in ZBTB17 gene was associated with DCM. The aim of the study was to analyze the distribution of SNP rs10927875 in ZBTB17 gene in 150 Slovak subjects, 55 patients with DCM (51.7ÃÂ±6.9 years) and 95 healthy controls (51.7ÃÂ±6.9 years) using the Custom TaqmanÃÂ®SNP Genotyping as says. The distribution of ZBTB17 gene rs10927875 polymorphism in Slovak patients with DCM was as follows: CC (36.4%), CT (58.2%), TT (5.4%), in controls: CC (44.2%), CT (51.6%), TT (4.2%). There was no difference in genotype or allele frequencies in ZBTB17 gene rs10927875 polymorphism (OR,0.75, 95% CI,0.46 1.23, P,0.25) between DCM patients and control subjects. Further studies in numerous files and additional functional inve stigations are needed to fully understand the roles of genetic associations. Knowledge of the genetic risk factors for DCM is important to initiate treat ment prior to symptomatic onset of the disease to delay its occurrence or possibly halt its progression.

This polymorphism regulates plasma level of enzyme which decreases from DD to II genotype. The aim of our study was to determinate allele/ genotype frequencies of this polymorphism in Czech population.940 individuals (470 F, 470M, age 18 69 years) of the Czech population were tested. DNA was isolated from oral mucosa or blood using MagCore HF16. ACE Gene I/D Polymorphism was tested by the End point PCR and agarose electrophoresis with visualization under UV light, verification was performed by strip assay reverse hybridization method. Allele I was detected in 47,2%, allele D in 52,8% of samples.

Missen se mutations in the NOTCH1 gene have been shown to be associated with calcific aortic valve disease plus BAV. However mutations in the NOTCH1 gene only partially explain the presence of BAV in the absence of other syn dromic features (i.e. Marfan Syndrome, Loeys Dietz Syndrome type I and II and Ehlers Danlos type IV Syndrome). In this study we analysed 50 patients with true BAV assessed by cardiac imaging (none of them with syndromic feature), for mutations in genes (n,48) belonging to the NOTCH1 signalling pathway (http://pathcards.genecards.org/pathway/1766) by means of massive parallel sequencing (My Seq, Illumina).

Some of the identified variations (n,26, 52%) coexisted in the same patient. The biological significance of such rare variations is unknown, but our fin dings strengthen the role of NOTCH pathway in cardiac valve development, indicating that BAV is, at least in part, an inherited familial disorder.

Hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS) is one of the most common and le thal congenital cardiac anomalies, characterized by an underdeveloped left ventricle, mitral valve and aorta. Despite strong evidence of an underlying genetic aetiology, only a minority of cases can be explained on genetic bases. Using genomics as well clinical studies, our work aims to identify new genes contributing to HLHS pathogenesis and explaining clinical and anatomical variability. We identified by exome sequencing novel de novo mutations in genes not previously associated to HLHS. In silico studies suggested that these genes are potentially involved in cardiac morphogenesis, and molecu lar 3D modeling highlighted the potential pathogenic effect of the identified mutations. Furthermore, we performed in vitro functional characterization of one of these variants falling in low density lipoprotein receptor related protein 6 (LRP6) gene. The preliminary results suggest that the mutation in LRP6 impairs the WNT signaling required in the induction of endothelial to mesenchymal transition (EndMT) during ventricular chambers formation. Further studies are required to confirm the mechanism by which LRP6 is involved in HLHS pathogenesis. In conclusion, due to genetic heterogeneity and phenotypic variability, elu cidating the causes of HLHS remains challenging. The development of this multidisciplinary approach will help to better understand HLHS by unco vering the multiple genetic mechanisms. Others patients are needed to find new genes.

Essential hypertension (EH) is a complex disease that arises from an inter action between environmental and genetic factors. It is been hypothesized that systemic inflammation plays a role in the pathogenesis of hypertension. We aimed to investigate expression profiles of inflammatory mediator genes in patients with EH and to analyze an association between these genes and the development of hypertension. We performed the analysis of gene expression in peripheral blood leuko cytes of patients with EH (N,57) and healthy individuals (N,51) using mi croarray technology (RT2ProfilerTM PCR Array, SABiosciences Corporation, Qiagen) with subsequent validation of the obtained results by quantitative real time RT PCR. The results have confirmed significant differences in tran scriptional activity of CCL2, CCL8, CCL18, CX3CR1, CXCL1, CXCL13, CCR5, IL10, IL13, XCR1, and CCR2 genes in cases and controls (ÃÂ,0.001). Next, we performed genotyping of polymorphic loci in genes with altered expression profile in the group of patients with EH (N,216) and healthy in dividuals (N,314). Allelic combinations associated with the disease were identified using Markov chain Monte Carlo approach (APSampler).We identified three allelic combinations of chemokine and chemo kine receptor genes associated with the increased risk of EH: CCL2 *T+CCR2*I+CX3CR1*M+CCR5*I+CXCR2*T (OR,6.342, FDR,0.04); CCR2*I+ CX3CR1*M+CXCL1*G+CXCR2*T (OR,4.48, FDR,0.04); CCR2*V+CXCL8*A+CCR5*I+ XCR1*T/T (OR,3.11, FDR,0.04).

The total incidence estimates to 1:48,000 100,000 newborns. Material: We report on 5 Moldavian children diagnosed with MMA (3 new borns, 7 and 30 mo old). Amino acids by liquid chromatography (blood/uri ne), NMR spectroscopy (urine for organic acids) and tandem MS/MS were used for diagnosis. Results: In three cases the clinical manifestations occurred in the neonatal period by: body weight loss [ 15%], dehydration, generalized hypotonia, re current vomiting, seizures, frequent apnoea, precoma, severe metabolic aci dosis: anion gap[17 26mmol/L], low pH[7.23 7.33], hyperlactacidaemia[2.6 8.0mmol/L], hypoglycaemia[1.8 2.8mmol/L], hyperammonaemia[126 390ÃÂµmol/L], ketonuria. In one case clinical signs debuted in the first week of life, but not being diagnosed he continued to present frequent precoma, ketoacidosis and sings of pancreatitis being defined as a MMA at 30 mo old. In another case, patient presented late onset from 7 mo old associated with similar symptoms as the previous case. In all cases there were identified: high level of MMAc in urine, positive C3[6.49 21.39,ref.val<4.4] and C3/C2[0.33 1.05,ref.val.<0.2]. In four children with neonatal clinical onset the urine MMAc was over 19 mol/molCrea when diagnosed with severe clinical evolution, while in the late onset child the urine MMAc was under 2 mol/molCrea with mild evolution.

Mucopolysaccharidosis type IVA is an autosomal recessive lysosomal sto rage disease characterized by intracellular accumulation of keratan sulfate and chondroitin 6 sulfate. Key clinical features include short stature, skele tal dysplasia, dental anomalies, and corneal clouding. Intelligence is normal and there is no direct central nervous system involvement, although the skeletal changes may result in neurologic complications. There is variab le severity, but patients with the severe phenotype usually do not survive past the second or third decade of life. N acetylgalactosamine 6 sulfatase (GALNS) enzyme activity is recommended as the first diagnostic test, espe cially when clinical findings strongly indicate MPS IVA and urine GAG ana lysis is normal. GALNS enzyme activity can be measured in cultured fibro blasts or leukocytes. Case Report: The case was a 12 years old boy born from consanguineous marriage due to normal pregnancy and delivery. He had normal growth and development until 2 years old. Then appeard spinal muscle weakness lea ding to kyphoscoliosis.

24576,"Introduction: The serum glutathione S transferase alpha (ÃÂ± GST) concen tration has been discovered as a marker of hepatocellular integrity after sevoflurane anaesthesia and mild impairment was observed. The role may play genetic polymorphism of genes, coding for enzymes involved in the metabolism and detoxification process o sevoflurane CYP2E1, GSTA1 and GSTP1. GSTA1*B ( 567T>G, 69C>T , 52G>A) allele is linked with reduced promotor activity, GSTP1*A, *B, *C are characterized by two amino acid substitutions Ile105Val (c.313A>G) and Ala114Val (c.341C>T), which also decrease the enzyme activity, while the variant 1053C>T in CYP2E1 gene is responsible for increased enzyme activity. Materials and methods: 86 unrelated Polish patients undergoing sevoflura ne general anaesthesia, were enrolled into the study. Measurement of serum ÃÂ± GST concentrations in three time points: before anaesthesia, directly after and 24 hours after the end of anaesthesia was performed using ELISA. Mole cular analyzes included sequencing of GSTA1 gene fragments and pyrose quencing for CYP2E1 and GSTP1 changes genotyping. Results: The increase of ÃÂ± GST concentration at the end of anaesthesia was observed in 54.7% of patients and 24 h later in 31.4% of subjects, but in all cases the increase was not statistically significant. Frequency of GSTA1*B was 43%, whereas the GSTP1 gene alleles 313G, 341T were found in 28% and 10% respectively. The CYP2E1 1053T variant was observed with 1% frequency. None of analyzed SNPs were significantly associated with the en zyme level. Conclusions: We not observed any significant hepatotoxic effect in Polish patients after sevoflurane anaesthesia and the ÃÂ± GST enzyme level was not associated with analyzed variants.",2015

Introduction : Familial intrahepatic cholestases (FICs) are a heterogeneous group of autosomal recessive disorders of childhood with cholestasis of he patocellular origin. Three distinct forms are described: FIC1, FIC2 and FIC3 due to mutations in ATP8B1 , ABCB11 and ABCB4 , respectively. Different mu tations in these genes may cause either a Ã¢ÂÂmalignantÃ¢ÂÂ progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis (PFIC) or a benign recurrent intrahepatic chole stasis (BRIC). Liver histology is important, but not specific, for diagnosis. Genotyping is conclusive. To exclude rare forms of transmission, the study of parents is required and to sort out the meaning of the novel mutations a molecular study of healthy controls and protein modelling are mandatory Methods: For the purposes of the present study we genotyped 27 children with intrahepatic cholestasis, diagnosed on either a clinical or histological basis. Results : Three BRIC, 22 PFIC and 2 BRIC/PFIC were identified. Thirty four different mutations were found of which 16 were novel. One was a 2Mb de letion (5Ã¢ÂÂUTR exon 18) in ATP8B1 . In another case microsatellite analysis of chromosome 2, including ABCB11 , showed uniparental disomy. Two cases were compound heterozygous for BRIC/PFIC2 mutations. The occurrence of mutations in the same genes in PFIC and BRIC indicates a continuum in se verity of the involved mutations, mostly exemplified by intermediate BRIC/PFIC form.

24583,"Mitochondrial dysfunction is consistently observed in Down syndrome (DS). It possibly contributes to determine DS mental retardation as well as other phenotypic abnormalities including AlzheimerÃ¢ÂÂs disease, type2 diabetes, obesity, and hypertrophic cardiopathy. In human DS cells we demonstra ted that mitochondrial dysfunction is associated to the downregulation of nuclear encoded mitochondrial genes (NEMGs). We identified the nuclear receptor interacting protein 1 (NRIP1/RIP140), a gene mapping to the chro mosome 21 and overexpressed in DS cells, as a good candidate for NEMG downregulation. We further demonstrated that NRIP1 transient attenuation is able to counteract mitochondrial dysfunction in DS fibroblasts. NRIP1 is known to affect oxidative metabolism and mitochondrial biogenesis by ne gatively controlling mitochondrial pathways regulated by PGC 1ÃÂ±.Based on this background, we are pursuing a project to correct mitochon drial alterations in DS by pharmacologically modulating the activity of the NRIP1 targets PGC 1ÃÂ± and PPARs. To this aim we have supplemented cultu res of fibroblasts from DS human fetuses with drugs affecting respectively PGC 1ÃÂ± and PPAR activity, namely metformin and pioglitazone, to evaluate their modulatory impact on mitochondrial function and morphology. We found this strategy effective on rescuing mitochondrial function in terms of oxygen consumption, ATP production and mitochondrial biogenesis.

It is characterized by elevated levels of uric acid in the blood leading to deposition of uric acid crystals in joints, tendons and surrounding tissues. This condition increases the risk of hy pertension, diabetes, metabolic syndrome, renal and cardiovascular disease. The Gout become more common in recent decades, affecting more than 2% of the populations. Materials and methods: We have performed an expression analysis of 34 Bulgarian male patients with Gout disease and 34 healthy controls. RNA was isolated from blood samples and Real Time PCR analysis using Custom RT2 Profiler PCR Array kit, containing 11 genes (NOD2, NLRP3, PYCARD, IL1B, MYD88, P2RX7, NFKB1, CASP1, CASP5, TRAF1, IRAK1) was applied. Results: The obtained results showed an increased expression of genes NOD2 and IL1B. The Nod2 is cytosolic receptor and its role is related to modulate the cytokine production by Th1 cells. The Il 1ÃÂ² is an important mediator of the inflammatory response and is involved in cell proliferati on, differentiation and apoptosis. The Il 1ÃÂ² predominantly derived from the innate immune cells and Th1 cells. The higher expression of these genes is connected to the acute inflammatory reaction.

24585,"Background. LeberÃ¢ÂÂs hereditary optic neuropathy (LHON) is an optic ner ve dysfunction due to mutations in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) which is transmitted in a maternal pattern. It is caused by three primary point muta tions, G11778A, G3460A and T14484C, in the mitochondrial genome. These mutations are sufficient to induce the disease, accounting for the majority of LHON cases, and affect genes that encode for different subunits of mitochon drial complexes I and III of the mitochondrial respiratory chain. Other mu tations, called secondary mutations, are ordinarily associated with primary mutations. There is currently no effective treatment for LHON. The purpose of this study was to determine MT ND variations in Iranian pa tients with LHON. Methods. In order to determine the prevalence and distribution of mito chondrial mutations in the LHON, the mtDNA was studied through PCR am plification and DNA sequence analysis. Results. In 35 LHON patients, MT ND gene sequencing revealed a total of 44 nucleotide variations (30 types) in the twenty seven LHON patients, but eight patients had no changes in the ND genes. Of the 30 types of changes, 50% were previously reported and 50% were novel changes. Conclusion. This clustering of mutations is therefore useful to extend the mtDNA polymorphism database of Iranian patients and should facilitate de finition of disease related mutations in human mtDNA. This research may help to understand the disease mechanism and may open up new experi mental and therapeutic opportunities of LHON for diagnostic testing and for future investigations.",2015

Among them, SIRT1, SIRT3 and SIRT4 have important roles in this regard. Since dysregulation of energy metabolism, oxidative stress and aging have been implicated in the pathophysiology of diabetes and its associated complicati ons; we aimed to measure SIRT1, SIRT3 and SIRT4 mRNA levels in patients with type 2 diabetes based on either with or without retinopathy and /or nephropathy. Methods: A total of 38 patients with type 2 diabetes were included in the study. The participants were categorized into two separate groups: Pati ents with retinopathy and/or nephropathy (group1) (n,19) and patients without retinopathy and/or nephropathy (group2) (n,19). We compared mRNA levels of SIRT1, SIRT3 and SIRT4 in PBMCs isolated from participa ting subjects using real time RT PCR.

It is the most common peroxisomal disorder with an estimated birth incidence of about 1 out of every 20,000. There is no ethnic predominance. The age of onset and morbidity are highly variable and progression is un predictable. Male hemizygotes may initially present with neurological sym ptoms in two different forms: (X ALD) with childhood presentations, and Adrenomyeloneuropathy (AMN) that presents in adulthood. Primary manifestations of X ALD are moderate cognitive deficits followed by diminished visual acuity, central deafness, cerebellar ataxia, hemiplegia, convulsions and dementia leading to a neurovegetative state or death within mostly in two years. X ALD is inherited in an X linked manner and mainly affects 4 to 8 year old boys.

24592,"Background: Tuberculosis is a necrotizing, chronic infection caused by a group of mycobacteria known as Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTC). About 9.0 million newly diagnosed tuberculosis cases and 1.5 million tuberculosis deaths are estimated to occur worldwide in 2013. Mycobac terium Tuberculosis is responsible for almost 99% of the cases. Clinically apparent infections occur in only 5 to 10% of all cases. Ethnic differences, twin studies, animal models and family segregation analyses support the hypothesis of genetic susceptibility to tuberculosis. Mendelian susceptibi lity to mycobacterial diseases (MSMD) is a rare congenital disease, charac terized by hereditary immunodeficiency causing mycobacterial infections. Mutations in IFN ÃÂ³ IL 12 pathway are considered to play a role in MSMD. Identifying MSMD mutations may contribute to explore molecular mecha nisms in hostÃ¢ÂÂs immune response. Aim: To investigate the role of mutations in IFNGR1, IFNGR2, IL12B and IL12RB1 genes for developing MSMD in ped iatric patients with extrapulmonary tuberculosis Methods: Mutations were investigated in IFNGR1, IFNGR2, IL12B and IL12RB1 genes by sequencing in 30 pediatric patients with extrapulmonary tuberculosis. Results: No mutation was detected in four genes which are involved in IFN IL12 pathway. However, we found polymorphisms which might cause susceptibility to tuberculosis: rs7749390 in IFNGR1 gene , rs9808753 in IFNGR2 gene, rs11575926 in gene IL112B , rs3212227 and rs436857 poly morphism in IL12RB1 gene. ConclusÃÂ±on: In this study, we report genetic analysis of IFN IL12 pathway on MSMD cases for the first time in the Aegean region of Turkey. Determining the frequencies of these polymorphisms in control samples and performing functional studies might elucidate the exact roles of these polymorphisms in TB infection in Turkish children.",2015

The impact of HbF on disease severity of Sickle cell and Beta thalassemia is well documented. Xmn1 HBG2, BCL11A and HBS1L MYB SNPs have been introduced as the most important factors causing variation in HbF levels. However the impact of these factors on HbF variation could be population specific and depends on the frequency of the HbF boosting allele (minor allele) in each population. Determining the effect of these factors in Iran, where thalassemia is the most common genetic disorder, is important. In here we genotyped 8 SNPs including Xmn1 HBG2, 5Ã¢ÂÂHS4, 2 BCL11A and 4 HBS1L MYB SNPs in 122 Iranian hematologically normal individuals, in cluding 51 male and 71 female. HbF values ranged from 0.3% 1.3% with a mean of 0.74 ÃÂ± 0.21. Multivariate linear regression analysis was used to evaluate the association between HbF and these SNPs. No association was observed between these SNPs and HbF levels of the normal individuals. This study could suggest that these HbF modifying factors are not able to explain common HbF variations in the Iranian normal population. In support of this controversy, the ability of SNPs in these three loci, in explaining the total HbF variation has been considerably different between European healthy adults (44%) and African patients with SCA (16 20%). Therefore, to further study the major regulators of common HbF variation in normal population of Iran, studies with larger population sizes and more number of SNPs are proposed.

Among the inflammato ry mediators in aggressive periodontitis, interleukine 1, codified by IL 1A and IL 1B genes, has an important role in tissue destruction. The aim of this study is to identify if there is an association between interleukine 1 gene polymorphism with the aggressive periodontitis. Materials and Methods: We comprised into our study 54 subjects (by clini cally orodental examination): 17 healthy subjects and 37 patients with ag gressive periodontitis. For the genetic polymorphism of IL 1 gene we used PCR reaction GenoType IL 1 (HAIN Lifescience, Germany). It detects IL 1A 889 and IL 1B+3953 from epithelial cells on buccal mucous (collected using sterile swabs). Statistical analysis was made using ANOVA test and Pearson correlation coefficient. Results: Regarding IL 1A 889 we found heterozygous (C/T) and homozy gous (T/T) profile at 9 (52.9%) heathy subjects, who will require special monitoring for possible onset of aggressive periodontitis, and at 27 (72.9%) patients. We identified significant difference in the frequence of the positive genotype between the healthy subjects and patients: for C/T p,0.023 and for T/T p,0.0006. Also, IL 1B+3953 polymophism was found at 7 (41.2%) heathy subjects and 30 (81.1%) patients and we also identified a signi ficant difference for C/T p,0.001 and for T/T p,0.0001 between the study groups. Conclusions: Our study demonstrates that the IL 1 gene polymorphisms are associated with aggressive periodontitis. Single nucleotide polymorphisms at IL 1A 889 and IL 1B+3954 loci identified at healthy subject may be useful as risk markers in producing aggressive periodontitis.",2015

Using system biology analysis we have determined of shared proteins/ge nes for BA and TB, assuming that the rare co occurrence can be attributed to shared biological mechanisms. Two associative protein networks of BA and TB were reconstructed using the ANDCell software. We found the 19 proteins associated with both BA and TB. Among the shared proteins identified in the study is gene SPP1 pre viously not studied for TB, genes CXCL10 , TNFRSF1B are not studied for BA, and genes CD4, CD79A are not studied for both BA and TB in Ã¢ÂÂcase controlÃ¢ÂÂ studies.

Aim of this study is to evaluate the possible association of LIF gene poly morphism rs929271 with mild ID. The group of mild ID patients consisted of 64 individuals including 40 (62.5 %) males and 24 (47.5 %) females, where previous extensive genetic investigations revealed no abnormalities.

The G allele occurred less frequently 0.328 in the control group than 0.445 in the ID patients group (p,0.02). It was shown that the risk of mild ID development increased for both hetero and homozygous carriers of minor G allele and the odd ratio was 2.09 (95% CI: 1.14 3.81).

24608,"Introduction: Rett syndrome (RTT) is a severe X linked dominant neurode velopmental disorder caused by mutations in MECP2 gene. The severity of clinical features is highly variable and tends to depend on specific mutati ons. Variation in X chromosome inactivation (XCI) is another factor, often causing milder or more severe phenotypes. The purpose of this study was to examine whether specific mutations and XCI pattern can explain different clinical manifestations in selected Czech patients with RTT .Subjects and methods: The severity of clinical features was evaluated in two pairs of patients with a confirmed mutation: P1 and P2 had a Ã¢ÂÂmildÃ¢ÂÂ mutati on p. Arg133Cys; P3 and P4 had a Ã¢ÂÂsevereÃ¢ÂÂ mutation p. Arg255*. XCI analysis was performed by a common human androgen receptor assay. Results and discussion: Both patients with p. Arg133Cys had random XCI (49:51 and 43:57). P1 presented with a more severe classic form of RTT , while P2 had a mild variant typical for this mutation. P3, carrying p. Arg255*, had skewed XCI (17:83) and in comparison with P4, who had random XCI (59:41), had considerably milder phenotype regarding the age at onset of symptoms and absent epilepsy. Both patients with the p. Arg255* mutation were more severely affected than patients with the p. Arg133C mutation. Conclusions: Our results support the hypothesis that specific MECP2 muta tions and XCI influence the clinical severity of RTT phenotype, but not in all cases. Exceptions to the rule point out the need to proceed with caution in clinical prognosis and suggest that other modifying factors are involved in RTT pathology.

Patients and Methods Both patients shared facial dysmorphic features (long face, wide forehead, depressed nasal base, pointed chin) and showed intellectual disability, more severe in the daughter. Additionally, the father manifested hiposmia and the daughter had behavioural/relation problems. Conventional and molecular karyotypes were performed. FISH experiments were completed using BAC clones for breakpoints approach at chromosome 15q. ResultsThe daughterÃÂ´s karyotype was 46,XX,inv(15)(q21q24)pat. aCGH revealed no genomic imbalances. FISH analysis showed that the RP11 586G22 BAC probe spanned the translocation breakpoint at 15q24.2, involving 5 genes (COMMD4, NEIL1, MAN2C1, SIN3A and PTPN9).

This work was done under the frame of European Social Fund, HumanResources Development Operational Programme 2007 2013,project POSDRU/159/1.5/136893.Results: The overall diagnostic yield of causal abnormalities was 30%. The overall yield of noncausal abnormalities was 10%. 20% came back without abnormality, while 40 % located findings that may represent a benign copy number variant, however genetic counselling was considered appropriate and blood samples from patents were requested. Conclusion: When interpreting a result form array CGH, distinguishing the characteristics of copy number changes in relation to their clinical relevance is essential. Nonetheless, the method provided a better understanding the genetic architecture of the heterogenic neurodevelopmental disorders, thus advancing diagnosis, prognosis, and counselling for patients and families.",2015
24612,"Detailed molecular cytogenetic studies combined with clinical characteri zation are needed to establish genotype phenotype correlations for specific deletion syndromes. Although many patients with subtelomeric deletions have been reported, the phenotype map for the terminal deletion 14q syn drome is only slowly emerging. A 14q32.3 terminal deletion with the bre akpoint 14q32.31 14q32.33 only has been reported in nine cases. Here, we report on a 3 year old patient with partial monosomy of 14q32.3. She was born of healthy non consanguineous parents, at 38 weeksÃ¢ÂÂof gestation with a birth weight and length of 2300g and 44cm respectively. Head circumfe rence at 3 years old was 44.5cm. Deletion size determined by molecular ka ryotyping (aCGH) is 14:102254905 107240840 ~ 5Mb, which was confir med by FISH. Major clinical features were presented with profound mental retardation and dysmorphisms, including broad forehead, depressed nasal bridge, pointed chin, hypotonia, epicanthus, excessive knee points extension in the standing position and walking ataxia, weakness of ligamentous ap paratus. Based on our findings and review of the literature, we refine the phenotype map for typical clinical findings of the terminal deletion 14q in cluding exclusively 14q32.31 14q32.33 bands. There is a phenotypic discre pancy in few reported so far cases, where the minimal region was 0.3Mb. Our patient hasnÃ¢ÂÂt congenital heart defects, genitourinary malformations and coloboma. Combining this phenotype map with benign copy number variation data available from the Database of Genomic Variants, we propose terminal deletion 14q involving approximately 75 annotated genes. These findings should contribute to delineate the emerging phenotype in terminal 14q32 deletion but need further data.",2015
24613,"Introduction: Microdeletions and microduplications are known cause for developmental delay (DD) and mental retardation (MR). MR/DD affect 1 to 5% of the general population. Establishing a genetic diagnosis in patients with MR/DD is a challenge. These small changes are not always detectable by routine karyotyping. Nowadays new molecular genetic approaches such as MLPA and array CGH allow precise detection of specific submicroscopic deletions or duplications. Next generation sequencing (NGS) could clarify diagnosis of patients with normal aCGH profile. Materials and Methods: Over a period of 4 years 355 patients with syndro mic MR of different severity were screened for deletions/duplications with MLPA. We used MLPA probe mixes P245 for microdeletion syndromes and P070/P036 for subtelomeric regions. Further analysis with aCGH was per formed for 29 patients. Two patients were additionally analyzed by Illumina TruSight Inherited Diseases panel. Results: In 56 patients (15.5%) out of 355 we were able to establish a gene tic diagnosis. 44 of all aberrations (12.4%) were detected by MLPA and 4 of them were further characterized by aCGH. In 10 cases (2.8%) aberrations were detected exclusively by aCGH. Among 29 patients screened by aCGH pathogenic CNVs were detected in 14 cases (48%). In 2 additional patients diagnosis was established by NGS. Conclusion: We present MLPA as an adequate screening procedure for cli nically recognizable conditions. Array CGH presents an opportunity to in vestigate cases with appropriate chromosomal phenotype, where MLPA was insufficient. In our study, aCGH allowed detection of several pathogenic CNVs outside known regions. NGS provides an opportunity to diagnose ca ses, outside the scope of MLPA or aCGH.

Introduction: Hereditary mental deficiencies (HMD) represent a group of genetic illnesses with different level of mental retardation. Most characte ristic for HMD is decreasing or substantial reducing of psychical activities witch determine a row of deregulations of adaptation processes and mecha nisms of organism and its existence in society. Medical genetic and psycho pedagogic assistance should have priority among all resources of ameliora tion of state of persons affected by mental deficiencies of genetic etiology. Scope of research consists in studying of development process of children with genetic pathologies associated to mental retardations in first three years of their life, using medical, psychological and pedagogic resources of amelioration. Materials and methods: The study included children diagnosed with genetic pathologies associated to mental retardations in first three years of life. Results: Research results demonstrate persistence of severe retardation of children with genetic pathologies in psycho medical aspect, related to insuf ficient development of all psychical processes and spheres. Psycho physical retardation of children with genetic pathologies is not so clear during first year of life, comparing with normal children, due to biological resources and to inborn potential of individuals. Deficiency of children with genetic patho logies becomes more evident after the age of one year old. Cognitive verbal behavior is most affected to children with genetic syndromes, followed by psycho motional and social affective behaviors. Conclusion: Development of psycho motional sphere represents an impor tant premise for achieving sustainable increasing of formation development of other neuro psychic spheres. Psycho pedagogic models of early diffe rentiated development, including psycho pedagogic individual program of formation, had a fundamental contribution to development of motricity, of social affective sphere and of speech.",2015

Microdeletions occurred between BP1 and BP2 of 15q11.2 Prader Willi/Angelman critical region are described in literature as the novel Burnside Butler Syndrome. There are four highly conserved and unimprinted genes within the 15q11.2(BP1 BP2) region: TUBGCP5,CYFIP1,NIPA1, and NIPA2 . TUBGCP5 is expressed in subthalamic nuclei, NIPA1 , NIPA2 and CYFIP1 are expressed in central nervous system. Haploinsufficiency for TUBGCP5, NIPA1, NIPA2 and CYFIP1, without Prader Willi syndrome, can explain some clinical features as delayed motor and speech development, dysmorphism and behavioural problems. We describe a case of a 5 old boy with a BP1 BP2 microdeletion of 443kb spanning these four genes. He had developmental delay, awkwardness of motor skills, behavioural pro blems, speech and language impairment and was referred for autism clinical suspicion. No dysmorphism was observed in the patient.aCGH showed a 15q11.2 microdeletion flanked by BP1 and BP2.MLPA analysis, performed on the trios, confirmed the microdeletion in the patient and his normal mother.

Background: KBG syndrome is an autosomal dominant disease characteri zed by intellectual disability, seizures, short stature, skeletal anomalies and distinct craniofacial features. It is caused by mutations in ANKRD11 gene. So far, nearly 30 mutated KBG patients are reported but the range of neurologic manifestations appears extremely broad. Methods: during regular genetic counseling we have seen an outpatient, aged 28 years, with macrodontia and distinct craniofacial dysmorphism. Direct sequencing of ANKRD11 coding regions was performed by Sanger method. Results: a novel c.2130delG heterozygous mutation leading to a premature frameshift p. Trp710Cysfs*9 was identified in ANKRD11. Detailed clinical features included macrodontia of upper incisors, sensorineural/mixed hea ring loss, hypoplastic lower ribs, brachydactyly with fifth finger clinodactyly, bicuspid aortic valve. Surprisingly, his neurologic evaluation did not reveal cognitive delay and he was of normal stature. Conclusion: in nearly all patients with KBG intellectual disabilities are in the mild to moderate range. Single mutations in ANKRD11 have been also re ported in idiopathic intellectual disability highlighting a major role for this gene in cognitive impairment and brain disorders. The present patient em phasizes the variability, especially with respect to the neurologic phenotype, related to ANKRD11 mutations allowing more accurate genetic counseling for our patients and their families.",2015
24617,"De novo CNV may represent a challenge for the clinical geneticist. We report on two cases with non syndromic intellectual disability and developmental delay (ID/DD) carrying a de novo rearrangement involving a single gene: a deletion spanning the ARHGAP12 gene, and a duplication spanning the CNOT6 gene. ARHGAP12 encodes for a member of a large family of proteins that activate Rho type GTPase. Other genes of the same family are involved in ID or play a role in the developing axons and growth cones, suggesting ARHGAP12 was a candidate for the disease. CNOT6 encodes a subunit of the Carbon Catabolite Repressor Protein 4 (CCR4 NOT) core transcriptional regulation complex. Given the role of regulatory complexes in the pathoge nesis of ID/DD, and the widespread expression of this gene, we considered its duplication as a variant of unknown significance. Because of parents con sanguinity, we decided to perform a whole exome sequencing (WES). In the first family, we found a reported nonsense mutation p. Arg377* in TRAPPC9, encoding a protein implicated in NF kB activation. Mutations in TRAPPC9 cause non syndromic ID associated with a small head circumference, mild cerebral white matter hypoplasia, and corpus callosum hypoplasia. Our pa tient presents a compatible phenotype. In the second family, we identified a missense homozygous change c.154C>T (p. Cys52Arg) in VLDLR predicted as deleterious. Mutations in this gene have been reported to cause cerebel lar ataxia, mental retardation and disequilibrium syndrome type 1, with a phenotype overlapping that of our patient. Our data suggest that de novo array CGH variants should be looked suspiciously in consanguineous cases, where WES may become mandatory in future.",2015

Results: Two linkage peaks on chromosomes 8 and 9 were obtained with maximum LOD scores of 2.65 and 2.25, respectively. Homozygous haplotypes with identical by descent inheritance were valid only for chromosome 8. Variants were filtered from WES data solely for the linkage region on chromosome 8. Amongst, novel variants with pathogenic affect on protein were prioriti zed. This combined effort has led to identification of one nonsense and two missense variations in three distinct genes. All variants segregated with the condition in the family and none of them were detected in almost 480con trol individuals from Turkey. In silico analyses predicted benign effect for the missense variants. We therefore identified the most likely variant that caused an early stop codon in a translation elongation factor. Conclusions: We have identified a novel gene that encodes a translation elongation factor associated with ID delayed motor development and seizures using linkage analysis and WES.

It is characteri zed by deficits in memory skills and language development with difficulty in learning and problem solving. Today, more than 50 genes were detected in patients with ID. In an effort to identify the disease causing mutations in patients with non syndromic autosomal recessive ID (NS ARID) using ho mozygosity mapping following by exome sequencing, we detected a homo zygous nonsense mutation, c.2587C>T , p. Gln863*, in the gene PIDD in two large consanguineous Pakistani families. Sanger sequencing analysis sho wed complete segregation within the two families with multiple affected in dividuals. Analysis of cryptic relatedness was performed on a set of 73,306 independent autosomal markers in PLINK version 1.07. The pair wise PI_HAT values between members of two families were less than 0.10 indicating that these two families were not closely related. P53 Induced Death Domain Protein (PIDD) is a Leucine rich repeat and death domain containing pro tein expressing in brain, with a key role in DNA damage/stress response. It acts as a cell fate switch through interacting with a pro survival molecule, RIP1 and activation of NF kB signaling to repair and survive the lesions, or via interacting with a pro death factor, RAIDD and activation of caspase 2 and apoptotic cell death. The p. Gln863*mutation was in the death domain (DD), through which PIDD interacts with other DD proteins such as RIP1 or RAIDD. Functional studies are ongoing to establish the mechanism of pa thogenicity of the variant detected.

We studied a large pedigree including 8 males affected with moderate intel lectual disability. All affected males had no distinctive dysmorphic features and the MRI showed a normal cerebellum. We first performed a haploty pe sharing analysis using SNP array in affected males, followed by whole exome sequencing in one affected male. Four deleterious mutations were evidenced in 4 distinct genes,namely FAAH2, MAGEE1, TAF9B and OPHN1, located in the haplotypic minimal region shared by affected males. After Sanger sequencing, only one variant in OPHN1,namely R243W,was found to be co segregated with the disease in all affected males and was absent in normal males. This variant altered a highly conserved residue located between the BAR and the PH domains of the oligophrenin protein,was pre dicted to be damaging by SIFT and Polyphen and was not listed in the EXAC database.

The effect of environmental factors on gene expression was analyzed by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) applied on 92 patients and 21 controls. Results: We found 394 differentially methylated regions (DMRs) between schizophrenia patients and control DNAs. In the promoters were discovered 146 CpG islands (96 hyper and 50 hypomethylated). The potential new dis covered candidate genes with DMRs participate in transcription regulation, neurotransmission, cell motility and adhesion and nervous system develop ment. Significant thermodynamic modifications in blood sera behavior of schizophrenia patients were revealed. The calorimetric profiles were classi fied in four distinct groups, reflecting different thermal stabilization of the high abundance portion of the serum proteome.

Transgenic mice misexpressing the ratÃ¢ÂÂs ADARB1 isoform is a model of endogenous depression, indicating that genetically determined differences in ADARB1 expression may be involved in psychiatric patholo gies. To test this, we performed an association study of common variants in ADARB1 gene with suicide attempt (SA) in psychiatric patients. Materials and Methods: 165 suicide attempters and 188 suicide non attempters, suffering from major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder or schizophrenia were genotyped for 11 selected tag variants mapping in ADARB1 region coding deaminase domain and 3Ã¢ÂÂ untranslated region. Asso ciations were tested using PearsonÃ¢ÂÂs ÃÂ2 test and logistic regression adjusted by psychiatric diagnoses. Multiple testing bias was corrected by applying a 10e6 permutation test.

The observed associations were confirmed with permutation test. Conclusion: This is the first study showing the association of ADARB1 with SA in psychiatric patients, implying genetically determined involvement of RNA editing in SA. The identified risk variants overlap putative 3Ã¢ÂÂ regulatory regions of ADARB1 and may influence its expression.",2015
24631,"Major Depression Disorder(MDD) affects morbility, mortality and quality of life of many people around the world(1). This disease has heritability between 30% and 40%, indicating an important genetic component(2). Otherwise, it has been suggested that the Val66Met polymorphism of the brain derived neurotrophic factor gene (BDNF) could be associated to this disorder(3). During the present investigation a case control approach was carried out in order to determine the genotype of clinical Colombian popula tion and their match controls. For this, a cognitive diagram of each individu al was evaluated using the standard psychological tests M. I.N. I, STAI, IDER, and YSQ SF, then genotyping was performed by qPCR and data was analyzed using R software. Association studies show no effect between these variants and MDD (OR,1 Y P value, 0,99). When psychological data was analyzed, a strong association between abuse and depression phenotype was found (OR,0.11, p,0.00036). When analyzing for interactions, between the BDNF variants and childhood abuse we observed that individuals with the Val al lele and childhood abuse where more prone to develop MDD (LOD,2.83). These results suggest that Val66Met variant per se has no influence over the MDD but people with the genotype Val/Val could be more vulnerable to develop a depressive disorder when they have been abused in their child hood.(1)Cheng, et al.

Cocaine dependence is a complex psychiatric disorder with both genetic and environmental factors involved. The involvement of different neurotrans mitter systems in cocaine effects makes the molecular machinery that con trols the release of neurotransmitters to the synaptic cleft a good candidate for participating in the development of the dependence. In a previous work we identified a risk haplotype for cocaine dependence in the gene encoding the N ethylmaleimide Sensitive Factor (NSF), which is essential for synap tic vesicle turnover. Recently, another study identified a large polymorphic copy number variant (CNV) that encompasses the first 13 exons of the NSF gene. We examined the possible contribution to cocaine dependence of this CNV in the NSF gene. For this purpose, we performed a case control associa tion study in a discovery sample of 359 cocaine dependent patients and 356 sex matched controls. Using qRT PCR technology we genotyped individuals and analyzed the results considering two genotype groups: low number of copies (2 and 3) and high number of copies (4, 5 and 6), and identified an association between cocaine dependence and the CNV (P,0.013). We then performed a replication study consisting of a new sample of 508 cocaine dependent patients and 569 controls, and the association persisted (P, 7.1 e 03). Finally, we did a pooled analysis and the association also remained significant (P, 1.8 e 04) with a higher frequency of individuals with low number of copies in cases (70.6%) than in controls (62.2%). These results, together with the ones obtained in a previous study from our group, support a role for the NSF gene in the susceptibility to cocaine dependence.",2015

Drug addiction is considered a disorder of neuroplasticity in brain reward and cognition systems that results from aberrant activation of gene expres sion programs in response to prolonged drug consumption. Non coding RNAs (ncRNAs), such as microRNAs (miRNAs), are key regulators of almost all aspects of cellular physiology. Recently, miRNAs were shown to play key roles in the drug induced remodelling of the brain reward system that likely drives the emergence of addiction. In this work we aim at exploring the role of miRNAs in drug addiction. Using a case control association approach we evaluated, in a sample of 735 drug dependent patients and 739 sex matched controls, the possible contribution to drug dependence predisposition of 62 SNPs in the 3Ã¢ÂÂUTR of several genes expressed in the central nervous system that are predicted to alter the binding of miRNA molecules. Seven polymor phic variants were found nominally associated with drug addiction. We sub sequently assessed these seven SNPs in a replication sample of 663 drug dependent patients and 667 sex matched controls and found association between rs1047383 in the PLCB1 gene and drug dependence. This associa tion remained significant when we analyzed the results in the whole sample (1,392 cases and 1,403 controls), with a higher frequency of carriers of the C allele in cases (40%) than in controls (35.5%). Our results suggest that the PLCB1 gene may participate in the susceptibility to drug dependence.",2015
24635,"Multiple Sclerosis (MS) affects nerves in the brain and spinal cord and has been the topic of global research; yet there is no commonly accepted cause and no cure for the disease. Mounting evidence supports the role of genetics in susceptibility to MS. From this perspective, a current effort focuses on the neurogenetics of the complex pathogenesis of MS in relation to factors such as mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) variations or mutations. The present study tested whether mtDNA T4216C variation in the ND1 mtDNA gene is associated with MS in an Iranian population. Blood samples were collected from 100 patients with MS and 100 unrelated healthy controls, and DNA extraction was carried out by means of a salting out method. By means of appropriate primers, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification was carried out for the mtDNA fragment. Afterwards, the PCR products were digested using Nla III restriction endonuclease en zyme for analysis of Restriction Fragment Length polymorphism (RFLP) in mtDNA T4216C variation. With electrophoresis by means of 3% agarose gel and safe DNA gel stain, we imaged restriction products in a UV transillumina tor. The accuracy of genotyping procedure was confirmed by sequencing the mtDNA fragment. No significant statistical difference in the frequency of the T4216C mtDNA variation was found between the patients (24 %) and the control subjects (21 %) (P,0.61). Logistic regression analysis showed an OR of 1.1 (95% CI,0.5 2.4).The present study revealed no association between the T4216C variation in mitochondrial ND1 gene, and MS.

We investigated the possible role of FH in AD susceptibility, age at AD onset (AAO) and cognitive decline in a sample of Italian subjects (504 AD patients and 265 controls). FH was ascertained by interview. FH was found in 28% of AD patients and 15% of controls (p,0.0001). The de gree of relationships among relatives with dementia was collected for 97 patients . Logistic regression analysis showed that FH carries an increased risk of AD (OR, 1.9,C.

It can be considered to be an autosomal dominant disorder and is caused by de letion or disruption of a gene or several genes on the proximal long arm of the paternal chromosome 15 or maternal uniparental disomy 15, because the genes on the maternal chromosome 15 are virtually inactive through imprinting. This region contains genes that are epigenetically imprinted. We report 12 years old girl with Prader Willi syndrome. At the day of her birth, she had severe hypotonia, her physiological reflexes were very indolent, also she could not suck or swallow herself. At the age of 12 the patient was admitted for genetic counselling. All laboratory tests for newborns were performed which showed normal results, including karyotipe test (46XX). Neurosonography showed asymetrical, rounded ventricles which suggested hypoxic ischemic changes in the brain. Phenotypically, almond shaped eyes, prominent nasal bridge and brachydactyly were observed. Moreover, defects in the internal organs, retardation and cysts in the brain were also observed.

24640,"Introduction: Autosomal dominant spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs) are genetically hete rogeneous neurological disorders characterized by cerebellar dysfunction mostly due to Purkinje cell degeneration. Spinocerebellar ataxia 28 (SCA28) is caused by heterozygous mutation in the AFG3L2 gene, on chromosome 18p11.22 q11.2. This gene encodes a component of the conserved m AAA metalloprotease complex involved in the maintenance of the mitochondrial proteome. Altered oxidative stress response has been supposed for SCA28 as well as for other neurodegenerative conditions. In eukaryotes, antioxidant enzymes involved in reactive oxygen species (ROS) response include superoxide dismutase (SOD) enzymes, which catalyze the conversion of superoxide anions to hydrogen peroxide, and catalase (CAT), a H 2O2 degrading enzyme. The Cu/ZnSOD or SOD1, is a cytosolic enzyme, the predominant SOD in most cells and tissues, accounting for 70 80 % of the total cellular SOD activity; the MnSOD or SOD2, is a key mitochondrial anti oxidant enzyme. Materials and methods: We evaluated in SCA28 patients vs. controls lymphoblastic cell lines (LCLs) mRNA levels of CAT , and SOD2.Results: We found that CAT and SOD2 expression were down regulated in SCA28 patients of 20% and 15% respectively (p,0.0118; p, 0.0004). The analysis of enzymatic activity showed a 10% of reduction of SOD1activity in SCA28 LCLs vs. controls. Conclusions: Major emphasis has been given on the role of oxidative stress and free radical chemistry with respect to major neurodegenerative disorders (e.g., AD, PD, andALS). Here we further suggest the role for oxidative stress in the pathogenic mechanism of more rare neurodegeneration disease such as SCA28.This work was financially supported bythe Italian Ministry of Health.",2015

Cytogenetic analysis of GTG banded metaphases revealed a de novo supernumerary ring chromosome in 50 % of the analyzed cells. aCGH indicated a 13.8 Mb gain of 8p11.22 q11.23 including 85 RefSeq genes. Based on gene expression and function analysis in databases, we suggest that developmental delay and corpus callosum hypoplasia may be caused by overdose of the NKX6 3, THAP1 , POMK, UBE2V2 genes. NKX6 3 encoded protein is transcriptional repressor involved in early stages of neural crest development. The neural localization of THAP1 and its nuclear compart mentalization suggests that it may control neuronal gene transcription. The highest expression of POMK gene in human fetal and adult brain suggests an important role in brain development.

However, except for SCN1A, there is no other evident candidate locus with higher observed mutation frequency. In clinical practice, there is often an urgent demand for complete analysis of epileptic genes panel, as many patient express unclear phenotype. Therefore, there is need for geno type/phenotype correlation studies to search for associations, which can be used in diagnostic gene prioritization. Materials and Methods: In 64 Slovak patients with a broad range of epilepsy phenotypes with no identified SCN1A mutation we sequenced the whole co ding region and surrounding intron sequences of candidate genes SCN2A, SCN1B, GABRG2 and PCDH19 (27 females). Results: In SCN2A, we have identified one causative variant (p. G211C) in patient with Lennox Gastaut (LG) syndrome and one splicing affecting nu cleotide variant in GABRG2 (c.327+1G>A) in patient with complex partial seizures with generalization. No other disease causing changes in selected genes were observed. Conclusions: Since there were only two SCN2A and GABRG2 causative va riants identified and neither SCN1B, nor PCDH19 causative variants were observed in any of 64 analyzed patients enrolled in the study, we can assume that there is no evident Ã¢ÂÂgene hierarchyÃ¢ÂÂ in etiology of the disease.

Accumulating evidence shows that schizophrenia and bipolar disorder have common genetic variance. Here we evaluated the association of this variant with schizophrenia and bipolar dis order in Iranian population. Methods: Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood of Five hundred schizophrenic patients, 500 bipolar patients and 500 normal controls and all were genotyped for the rs1063843 using a PCR RFLP method. Results: The allele frequency of rs1063843 was significantly different in both schizophrenia and bipolar patients comparing to control group (P,<0.001, OR,1.4 and P,<0.00.1, OR,1.39 respectively).Conclusion: For the first time we showed that rs1063843 is highly asso ciated with bipolar disorder, although more replication studies are needed to confirm our findings.

Wolframin 1 (encoded by WFS1 gene loca ted at 4p16.1 was previously linked to bipolar disorder) is involved in endo plasmic reticulum (ER) stress response. WFS1 gene polymorphisms were associated with psychiatric disorders and personality traits. We aimed to examine gene environment (GxE) and gene gene (GxG) inter action models based on genes encoding proteins involved in ER stress: wolf ramin 1 (WFS1) and neighboring 4p16.1 region, activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6) and X box binding protein 1 (XBP1) gene polymorphisms contributing into personality traits variation in healthy individuals. In total, 1018 healthy individuals (68% women) from Russia (mean ageÃÂ±SD: 19.81ÃÂ±2.65 years) without any history of psychopathologies were subjected to personality traits assessment via TCI 125 and EPI. Involved individuals are Caucasians from Russian (N,409), Tatar (N,290), Bashkir (N,130) and Udmurt populations (N,189). Socio demographic data including gender, order and season of birth, prenatal solar activity (SA), place of residence, childhood maltreatment were obtained. Genotyping of 48 SNPs was per formed with SNPlexTM platform (Applied Biosystems). Statistical analysis was conducted with PLINK v.1.07 corrected via FDR procedure for multiple comparisons. The following GxE models have been revealed: ATF6 rs12045480*SA (PFDR,0.044) and WFS1 rs6828983*SA (PFDR,0.038) interactions affec ted neuroticism and Self directedness, respectively. No significant GxG mo dels were observed after FDR correction. Accordingly, solar activity (measu red as sunspots number) within gestation appears to modulate the effect of ER stress related genes on personality. The possible mechanism of this modulation refers to epigenetic modifications occurred depending on high/ low solar activity.

Here we conducted TDT analysis in a lar ge ADHD sample of 794 nuclear families to re examine the relationship between DBH and ADHD. Although we did not replicate associations of rs2519152 and rs1611115 with ADHD, we identified a significant associati on with rs129882 (pcorrected , 0.02). Further, gene reporter assays of DBH rs129882 showed a significant impact of the ADHD associated C allele on luciferase expression in a human neuroblastoma cell line, SH SY5Y.

L 2 hydroxyglutaric aciduria (L2HGA) is an autosomal recessive neurome tabolic disorder characterized essentially by the presence of elevated levels of L 2 hydroxyglutaric acid (LGA) in plasma, cerebrospinal fluid and urine. L2HGA is caused by a deficiency in the L2 Hydroxyglutaric dehydrogena se (L2HGDH) enzyme involved in the oxidation of LGA to the alpha 2 ke toglutarate. LGA has been proposed as an endo and exogenous cytotoxic organic acid which induces free radical formation and generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). In this report, we analyzed 14 L2HGA patients be longing to 6 unrelated consanguineous families originated from the south of Tunisia. The patients were diagnosed with L2HGA disease confirmed on the presence of high level of LGA in urine.

24656,"Introduction: A consanguineous family from Turkey having two children with intellectual disability exhibiting myoclonic, febrile and other genera lized seizures has been recruited to identify the genetic origin of this phe notype. Materials and Methods: Physical and neurological examinations of all family members were performed and magnetic resonance imaging and electroen cephalography recordings were analyzed with information on family histo ry. A combined approach of SNP genotyping and exome sequencing were employed both to screen identified genes of Dravet syndrome and to detect homozygous variants common to affected sibs assuming a recessive inhe ritance model due to consanguinity in the family. The exome data analysis was extended further to potentially compound heterozygotes in the affected sibs. Results: The study identified two paternally inherited genetic variants in SCN1A (rs121917918; p. R101Q and p. I1576T), one of which was previously implicated in Dravet syndrome. Interestingly, the previously reported clini cal variant (rs121917918; p. R101Q) displayed mosaicism in the blood and saliva of the father. Conclusion: The study supported the genetic diagnosis of affected children as Dravet syndrome possibly due to the combined effect of one clinically associated (rs121917918; p. R101Q) and one novel (p. I1576T) variants in SCN1A gene. This finding is important given that heterozygous variants may be overlooked in standard exome scans of consanguineous families. Thus, we are presenting an interesting example, where the inheritance of the con dition may be misinterpreted as recessive and identical by descent due to consanguinity and mosaicism in one of the parents.

For a pro per diagnosis, clinical and paraclinical examination, electromiography, have been completed with dystrophin genetic analysis, also immunohistochemi stry and western blotting.

Copy number polymor phism (CNP) of 5q13.3 centromeric counterpart of the SMN1 gene, SMN2 , is the main modifier of SMA phenotype, but the influence of rearrangements of other genes at 5q13.3 segmental duplication (SERF1A and NAIP ) still remain elusive. Materials and Methods: CNP of the 5q13.3 genes was determined in 99 Serbian patients with homozygous absence of SMN1 (23 with severe type I, 37 with intermediate type II and 39 with mild type III), and 122 patientsÃ¢ÂÂ parents by MLPA. Correlation of SMN2 , SERF1A and NAIP CNP with disease severity, indicated by the type of SMA, was performed by Spearman rank test, while their joint effect was fitted using generalised linear models. Results: Strong inverse correlation was observed between SMN2 , SERF1A and NAIP CNP and SMA type (ÃÂ,0.85, p,2.2e 16; ÃÂ,0.659, p,6.661e 15; ÃÂ,0.523, p,1.403e 08, respectively). Starting with full model including the SMN2 , SERF1A and NAIP CNP and their interactions, the best minimal model describing SMA phenotypic variability included SMN2 CNP (p<2e 16), SER F1A CNP (p<2e 16) and their interaction (p,0.02628). Conclusion: Obtained results stress out that unequal rearrangements of 5q13.3 segmental duplication significantly contribute to phenotypic varia bilityof SMA.",2015
24668,"of Biotechnology, College of Science, Tehran, Iran, Islamic Republic of. Introduction: Hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy with proximal pre dominance (HMSN P) is considered a form of HMSN, so far identified only in families from the Far East. Aims: Identify genetic cause of a neuromuscular disease in a large Iranian pedigree, delineate the disease, and describe presentations. Methods: Linkage analysis and exome sequencing were performed. Thirteen individuals were studied. Two candidate sequence variations were tested for segregation with disease and screened in 420 controls. Subjective, bio chemical, nerve conduction, electromyography, and muscle MRI data were obtained. Results: A mutation in TFG was identified as cause of disease. The same mu tation had been reported as cause of HMSN P in patients of Far East ance stry. Phenotypic and genetic analysis revealed that the Iranian patients were also affected with HMSN P . Three different haplotypes were recognized for the mutated alleles. The unreported or less common features of the Iranian patients include usual asymmetric initial presentation, involvement of ab dominal muscles, and predominant paroxysmal dry coughing. Urinary dys function and rapid progression were sometimes observed. Hyperlipidemia was not common. Nerve conduction studies suggested sensory nerves are prominently affected. Muscle MRIs and clinical examinations revealed par allel involvement of both proximal and distal muscles. Conclusions: HMSN P , which is a misnomer, is not confined to the Far East and may have not been diagnosed in other populations. Absence of identity by descent in its only known mutation suggests at least three independent origins. There is clinical variability. Sensory nerves are prominently affected. Proximal and distal muscles are involved. The disease is a neuronopathy.",2015

24671,"Introduction: Three children from three different nuclear families had hy perhomocysteinemia, developmental delay, lens dislocation and glaucoma in the first decade of life. DNA sequence variations in methylene tetrahy drofolate reductase (MTHFR) and cystathionine beta synthase (CBS) have been reported to cause hyperhomocysteinemia associated anomalies. MTH FR and CBS genes were therefore screened, to identify the genetic cause of hyperhomocysteinemia and ocular anomalies in these patients. Materials and Methods: Hyperhomocysteinemia associated MTHFR po lymorphisms C677T and A1298C were initially screened by restriction fragment length polymorphism method in the three families. CBS exonic sequences along with consensus splice sites were then Sanger sequenced. Mutation segregation in the parents and available family members was also confirmed through sequencing. Results: MTHFR C677T and A1298C polymorphisms were found not to be associated with hyperhomocysteinemia, developmental delay and ocular phenotype. However, CBS sequencing resulted in identification of two no vel mutations, a missense change (c.467T>C; p. Leu156Pro) in exon 7, an in frame deletion (c.808_810del; p. Glu270del) in exon 10, and a recurrent missense mutation (c.770C>T; p. Thr257Met) in exon 10 of the CBS gene. The three different mutations in these three different patients were homo zygous, which they had inherited from respective carrier parents.

Introduction: High throughput, large scale parallel sequencing (next genera tion sequencing, NGS) technology has been installed in clinical laboratories for generate massive amount of sequence data from entire human genome in a short time with low cost as an ideal approach for the mutation analysis of hard to diagnose genetic diseases. This study presents an undiagnosed Iranian family with three affected members showing severe intellectual disability, distinctive facial features short philtrum, facial hypotonia, down slanting palpebral fissures and almond shaped eyes, decreased visual acui ty, narrow hands and feet and mild scoliosis. Materials and Methods: Mutation analysis in one of affected patients was performed by NGS and validated by Sanger sequencing for confirmation in all three affected patients and parents. Results: Exploration of obtained sequence data revealed new missense mutation in the homolog of the yeast vacuolar protein sorting 13 genes (VPS13B) as disease causing mutation. So that all three patients shared the same homozygote genotype for this new mutation whereas parents was he terozygous. Conclusions: In conclusion, since VPS13B have been reported as a cause of Cohen syndrome, this strategy was led to the clinical diagnosis of patients in this family with a phenotype strongly suggestive of Cohen syndrome. Thus, this study is a best example that demonstrated the incorporation of NGS and Sanger sequencing to identifying the etiology of such rare complex genetic diseases in short time. References:1.

Here we report the molecular karyotyping and phenotypic description of a new patient with 2q21.1 deletion and 1q42.2 duplication. Our patient presented with developmental delay, epilepsy, abnormal brain MRI and dys morphic features. 2q21.1 deletion encompassing 28 genes (some of these genes are expressed in the brain) seems to be responsible for the clinical phenotype in the presented case. Duplications of 2q21.1 are rare with only a few cases reported to date in the literature. The phenotypic and genetic findings of our patient will be compared with those of previously reported individuals. We indicate the possible candidate genes, providing new data supporting further genotype phenotype studies.

Narrow palpebral fissures, ptosis, epicanthus inversus and telechan tus are the main features of BPES. It is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. In BPES Type I premature ovarian insufficiency is present with eye lid malformation. BPES Type II includes only eyelid malformation. Hetero zygous mutations in FOXL2 gene which is located on chromsome 3q22.3 are responsible for both types of BPES. Chromosomal rearrangements involving this location also were repoted in BPES cases. In this study we report a case which was diagnosed as BPES and a novel mutation was detected .Method: By evaluation of clinical findings and sanger sequencing of FOXL2 gene the case was diagnosed as BPES and discussed in the light of literatu re.

We herein present the results of the first direct DNA diagnosis in 9 Russian unrelated patients with MFS aged from 2 to 52 years. Eight 8 different hete rozygous mutations in 8 probands was found (of which 6 were novel) and 1 patient had a substitution with unknown clinical significance described in SNP as rs112287730 with the incidence 0.02% (family analysis has shown its association with the disease in this family). Mutations were distributed along the length of the FBN1 gene. In contrast to the literature data, most of the mutations were null mutations: 3 frame shift, 3 splice site, 1 nonsense. Most of the detected mutations (7 of 9) lead to the severe clinical presen tation. Genotype phenotype correlation analysis showed that mutations in exons 24 32 of FBN1 gene are associated with a high risk of a severe cardio vascular disease with a poor prognosis of life for all ages. Two patients with mutations in terminal exons 62 and 66 had severe changes in the skeletal, ocular, and cardiovascular systems (that diverges with the literature data).

Associated symptoms and findings may vary from case to case. In most cases, the trisomy appears to result from a balanced chromosomal rearrangement in one of the parents; rarely, it is thought to arise from spontaneous (de novo) errors early in embryonic development occured for unknown reasons (sporadically).Methods: Case report of a 2 weeks old new born infant , with facial dysmorfism, swal lowing disorders, 3rd left space parasternal intense ejection systolic mur mur , generalized hypotonia. From the anamnestic dates we retain: healthy 28 years old parents; gesta tional age 37 weeks, birth weight,2040g, Apgar score 9 at 1 minute, moni tored pregnancy with oligoamnios.

There is a possibility to stay alive, but most infants with the syndrome die within the first three months after birth. Case report: We report 7 months old girl with Patau syndrome. She had low set ears, flattened nose, wider then usual area between eyebrows, cataracts, coloboma and heart defects. Genetical tests were made two times during pregnancy, but higher risk for Patau syndrome was not shown . What is more fetus was tested with ultrasound but there were not found any abnormali ties either. Trisomy 13 was confirmed by examining the infantÃ¢ÂÂs chromoso mal pattern through karyotyping. Also it is important to highlight the fact that parents were in the middle age and healthy. Patient was treated with dorzolamide and timolum, dekstrose infusion, oxygen therapy and others. After all medication infantÃ¢ÂÂs condition was stabilized. ABSTRACTS PUBLISHED ABSTRACTS ESHG 2015 | GLASGOW, SCOTLAND, UK | WWW. ESHG. ORG 428Back to inde x",2015
24688,"Farhud Genetic Clinic), Teharan, Iran, Islamic Republic of, 2Researcher, Cellular and Molecular Research Center, Research Institute for Endocrine Sciences, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Teharan, Iran, Islamic Republic of. Background:The androgen insensitivity syndrome (AIS) or testicular femini zation is a partial or complete inability of the cell respond to androgen. This syndrome is caused by inutility of androgen and so, testosterone converts into estrogen. The human androgen receptor (AR) is encoded by a gene lo cated on the X chromosome. AIS occurs when the AR is impaired. This inex pressive to androgen hormone can damage or prevent masculinization of male genitalia in the developing status. AIS is divided in three categories, complete, partial and mild by intensity of external genital masculinization. Methods:The specified screening was applied in 70 AIS patients and XY pat tern was cytogenetically diagnosed and confirmed, out of 72000 familiesÃ¢ÂÂ medical records in Tehran Genetic Clinic. The essential basis to submit these patients to the Genetic Clinic from their gynecologist was primary amenor rhea. The other indicators are assessed such as: maternal and paternal age, parents consanguineous marriages, family history and clinical observation of the patients. Results:The results specify that there was no association in maternal and paternal age. Marriage pattern of the parents has not shown any remarkab le results in AIS cases. The clinical surveillance illustrated that amenorrhea has a high percentage in case study which may prove that it is the primary symptom of AIS patients. Conclusion:The correlation of maternal and paternal age with AIS is not found. The parentÃ¢ÂÂs consanguineous marriage is high as a national culture in Iran. The frequency in clinical observation is reasonable and high percenta ge of this observation belongs to Amenorrhea. Therefore, amenorrhea is the most significant signs of AIS based on clinical assessments.",2015

The latter was mapped to the re gion of 17p13.3 microduplication syndrome. However the genes from criti cal region (YWHAE, PAFAH1B1, CRK) were not affected by CNV. The patient was born from the first pregnancy from healthy non consanguinity parents. A boy presented a severe developmental delay with inability to hold up the head up to 7 months. He doesnÃ¢ÂÂt sit at the age of 1.2 years old. A clinical examination revealed microcephaly, downslanting palpebral fissures, epi canthus, hypertelorism, hypermetropy, astigmatism, divergent concomitant strabismus, small nose with saddle broad nasal bridge and flat tip, protru ded low set ears, long smooth philtrum, short neck, hypertelorism of nipp les. Early teething at the age of 4 month was noted. At the age of observation a boy has 10 teeth. Oval foramen of heart was also observed. Abdominal ultrasound revealed no pathology.

Deficiency of methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) causes a deficiency of the active metabolic form of folic acid, with impor tant consequences, especially haematological (anemia, trombocytopenia) and hyperhomocysteinemia, a metabolic disorder which stimulates prolife ration of smooth muscular cells, promoting early onset of atherogenesis, a risk factor for cardiac and cerebro vascular disease. Folic acid deficiency is cited as promoting factor of chromosomal nondisjunction in gametogenesis, with increased risk for appearance of aneuploidy. The study aims to evaluate the prevalence of C677T and A1298C mutation in MTHFRgene in a group of children with 21 trisomy and in their mothers. Patients and methods. The study group consisted of 73 patients with 21 tri somy and 67 mothers, who were registered in the Center of Genetic Patho logy of First Paediatric Clinic Cluj in the period 2010 2014. Analysis of the two mutations was performed by PCR RFLP technique. Results. There were diagnosed 19 homozygotes (8 with C677T mutation and 11 with A1298C mutation), 16 composite heterozygotes and 31 hete rozygotes (14 with C677T mutation and 17 with A1298C mutation). There were diagnosed 18 homozygous mothers (7 with C677T mutation and 11 with A1298C mutation), 15 composite heterozygotes and 28 heterozygotes (12 with C677T mutation and 16 with A1298C mutation).Conclusions. Introduction of folic acid therapy in patients with 21 trisomy, homozygotes for C677T and A1298C mutations is beneficial in improvement of evolution of this patients, and treatment with folic acid in woman with homozygote or composite heterozygote genotype might reduce the risk of chromosomal nondisjunction in gametogenesis.

24694,"Osteoporosis is a systemic bone disease characterized by low bone mineral density and structural deterioration of bone tissue leading to an increased risk of fractures. Genetic factors have been recognized to play an important role in osteoporosis and a number of susceptibility genes have been identi fied and validated. Here, we describe an 11 year old girl affected by severe osteoporosis with vertebral fracture and intellectual disability. Her father was affected by a severe form, too. Cytogenetic investigations revealed a dicentric chromosome 5, rearranged at the centromeric level, present also in her father. The two centromeres were both active, as demonstrated by immunological staining with CENP C antibodies. Array CGH of the proposita showed a large proximal duplication at 5p11q11.2 band and a small distal one at 5q11.2, while her father presented a unique duplication of 5p11q11.2 bands. The duplicated region on chromosome 5 contains ITGA1 (integrin al pha 1), an osteoporosis susceptibility gene, and FST (follistatin) gene. ITGA1 encodes integrin alpha 1 chain that binds to the beta chain to form a recep tor involved in cell attachment and neurite outgrowth on laminin and colla gen. Proper collagen integrin interactions are important in fracture healing, which suggests that ITGA1 plays role in the regulation of mesenchymal stem cell and cartilage proliferation. FST encodes a monomeric glycoprotein that actively participates in the regulation of bone metabolism. Experiments performed in mice overexpressing follistatin showed a decreased quality of skeleton and susceptibility to bone fractures. In conclusion, interstitial 5p11q11.2duplication involving ITGA1 and FST could play a causative role in familial osteoporosis.",2015
24695,"The 22q11 chromosomal region contains low copy repeats sequences that mediate non allelic homologous recombination, which predisposes to CNVs at this locus. Hemizygous deletions result in the 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11.2 DS) that presents a highly variable phenotype, including congeni tal heart diseases. Most of cases present a ~3 Mb typical deletion, spanning LCRs A D, and a minority of cases present a ~1.5 Mb nested proximal deleti on spanning LCR22 A to LCR22 B; but other atypical CNVs have been repor ted. We used high resolution array genomic hybridization (aGH) technique (CytoScan HD chip, AffymetrixÃÂ®) to map the breakpoints at 22q11.2 region and investigate CNVs in other genomic regions in a cohort of 28 subjects with congenital heart disease and 22q11.2 deletion, previously detected by FISH and/or MLPA. Twenty seven patients showed the typical deletion at 22q11.2 and one patient showed the proximal deletion. The size of dele tion at 22q11.2 region varied from 1.8 Mb to 3.3 Mb. The breakpoints in 22q11.2 proximal region were from 18.644.790 to 18.916.842 kb and from 20.716.903 to 21.915.509 kb in distal region (Hg 19). The genes in these two breakpoint regions are variably hemizygous depending on the location of the breakpoints. 22 CNVs Ã¢ÂÂ¥ 300 kb outside the 22q11.2 region were de tected, including a deletion at 11q14.3 (2.9 Mb) and duplications at 5q11.1 (628 kb), 6p21.2 (668 kb), 7p11.2 (662 kb) and 16q23.3 (367 kb).

We report the identification and characterization of many new genetic syndromes, including Ogden Syndrome, RBCK1 Syn drome, and most recently RykDax Syndrome. This latter syndrome presents with severe intellectual disability (ID) and very distinctive facial features. We show increased reliability of the biological inferences with an integra tive WGS pipeline, including a new algorithm, Scalpel, developed for more accurate identification of indels. We find a 2 to 5 fold difference in the vari ants detected as being relevant for various disease models when using dif ferent sets of sequencing data and analysis pipelines, and we derive greater accuracy when more pipelines are used in conjunction with data encom passing a larger portion of the family. We have shown that 60X WGS depth of coverage from the Illumina HiSeq platform is needed to recover 95% of indels. We also developed SeqHBase, a big data based toolset for analysing family based sequencing data, and we demonstrated SeqHBaseÃ¢ÂÂs high effici ency and scalability on several disorders, including with RykDax Syndrome, where we identified a maternally inherited missense variant in an X chro mosomal gene, TAF1.

In our previous study we examined KMT2D/KDM6A mutations in cohort of Czech patients referred for KS genetic testing. Seven Ã¢ÂÂnegativeÃ¢ÂÂ patients were subjected to clinical exome sequencing (TruSightOne, Illumina, USA) in order to reveal pathogenic disease genes and variants responsible for Kabuki like pheno type. In two male patients we found truncating mutations in EFTUD2 gene (linked to mandibulofacial dysostosis), in one of these patients in mocaics form, while another male patient had deleterious missense mutation in HU WE1 gene (X linked mental retardation). Truncating mutation in KMT2C gene (previously linked to Kleefstra syndrome spectrum) was detected in female patient. KMT2C interacts with KDM6A and EHMT1 from this spectrum. In the remaining three patients potentially pathogenic missense and truncating variants in TGFBR2, KIF1A, RAI1, ILRAPL1, CDH15, SHANK3 and ZEB2 will be further assessed.

We report a 12 years old female patient with clinical presentation of MCA/ MR syndrome including severe growth retardation, facial dysmorphism, microcephaly, limb anomalies, skin and hair pigmentation abnormalities, generalized hypertrichosis and mild mental retardation. The child was born from a first pregnancy of young and healthy non con sanguineous parents with low birth weight (1600g), microcephaly and dys morphic features noticed at birth. The karyotype of the patient was normal (46,XX). Because of the present severe growth retardation and microcepha ly, right hand deformity, and generalized hypertrichosis with synophrys the initial clinical diagnosis was Cornelia de Lange syndrome. The most prominent dysmorphic features at the age of 12 years included synophrys, hypertelorism and telecanthus, high nasal bridge, high arched palate together with generalized hypertrichosis and premature graying of the hair, skin hypopigmentation areas, and cafÃÂ© au lait spots.

Using exome sequencing we identified biallelic protein truncating variants in CENPF in a patient with apple peel intestinal atresia, microcephaly and ocular anomalies. The mu tations were confirmed by Sanger sequencing and each unaffected parent was shown to be a heterozygous CENPF truncating mutation carrier. Neither mutation was present in the ICR1000 UK population exome series, nor the ExAC database of >60,000 exomes. Further sequencing of individuals with the same phenotype identified three additional cases from two unrelated families who also carry CENPF truncating mutations. CENPF encodes a protein that is required for kinetochore function and chromosome segregation in mitosis. It is also involved in the regulation of DNA synthesis and hence cell cycle progression. Our findings demonstrate that the association of apple peel intestinal atresia, microcephaly and eye anomalies is a distinct recessive genetic syndrome caused by inactivating mutations in CENPF.

Rubinstein Taybi syndrome (RSTS, # 180849, # 613684) is a rare disorder characterised by cognitive impairment and congenital anomalies. Mutations in two homologous genes CREBBP and EP300 are responsible for ~55% and~8% of RSTS patients, respectively. CREBBP mutational spectrum inclu des point mutations (30 50%) and deletions (~10%). We report 14 novel CREBBP deletions identified by FISH and MLPA in a cohort of 171 RSTS pati ents. By FISH we detected five large deletions (from 480 kb to 1.35 Mb), one encompassing only CREBBP , whereas the others four extending beyond the gene at both the 5Ã¢ÂÂ and 3Ã¢ÂÂ ends. The patients displayed a phenotype often in discernible from those carrying CREBBP point mutations, although a slight ly more complex clinical presentation was observed. By MLPA we identified nine deletions (from 930 pb to 154 kb): two affect a single exon, the other seven remove one/ many CREBBP exon/s and a region including TRAP1 gene and a part of SLX4. Among these patients, the phenotype ranged across the spectrum found in point mutations carriers. All 14 deletions, were vali dated by aCGH, and their breakpoints precisely mapped.

Genetic factors are among the factors playing an important role in the initiation and progres sion of these tumors. A subset of uterine leiomyomas, shows chromosomal rearrangements of the region 12q15, leading to an over expression of the high mobility group protein A2 gene (HMGA2). The purpose of this study was to assess the HMGA2 gene expression in samples of uterine myoma in Iranian patients. Methods: The gene expression analysis was performed using quantitative RealTime PCR on 49 tissue samples including, 39 uterine leiomyomas and 10 normal uterine tissues as control. The relative quantification was as sessed using REST software 2009.Results: HMGA2 gene was significantly over expressed in 89% of the uteri ne leiomyomas compared to normal tissue. However, the gene was not ex pressed in 11% of the leiomyomas. Conclusion: HMGA2 gene over expression plays an important role in the for mation of the majority of tumors.

In this study, we purposed to deter mine eventual differences between hRgr and dtr hRgr expression levels in subtypes of T cell malignancies initiatively. Thus we generate perspectives on inhibiting dtr hRgr as a future treatment in T cell ALL. Materials and Methods: Peripheral blood samples were obtained from pati ents with T ALL and B ALL. Human T and B cell lines were used as controls. Total RNA was extracted from peripheral blood samples with using trizol methods. Gene specific oligonucleotides were used for the abnormal hRgr and human GAPDH in qRT PCR. Relative fold changes were calculated using the 2 ÃÂÃÂCt method. Results: qRT PCR analysis was performed and overexpression of the ab normal hRgr transcript is only observed in T ALL derived cell lines (Jurkat, CEM) and in human tissues with T cell malignancies. Conclusion: In with the aggressive treatment the prognosis for relapse in childhood T cell ALL remains poor. In this study we indicate abnormal ex pression of dtr hRgr in T cell ALL. In ALL treatment, molecular tests are im portant for risk classification at initial diagnosis. dtr hRgr may be a potenti al target for therapeutic approaches in future treatment in T cell ALL.

Recent evidence indicates the involvement of autophagy ATG16L1 gene in Helicobacter pylori infec tion and gastric carcinogenesis. Our study aimed to analyze the expression profile of ATG16L1 gene in gastric adenocarcinoma and to assess the possib le association of ATG16L1 T300A (rs2241880) polymorphism with the risk of gastric cancer. A total of 350 Romanian subjects (108 patients with gastric adenocarcinoma and 242 healthy controls) were genotyped by allelic discri mination TaqMan PCR assay with specific probes. ATG16L1 mRNA level was evaluated by qRT PCR in biopsied tumoral and peritumoral tissue obtained by upper endoscopy from 34 patients. All genotype frequencies were distri buted in accordance with Hardy Weinberg equilibrium. A statistically signi ficant association was observed for both AG and GG genotype carriers and furthermore, in a dominant model for carriers of G allele. Stratified analysis showed that the G allele of the ATG16L1 T300A polymorphism confers a protective effect, especially against non cardia and intestinal type of gastric adenocarcinoma in the Romanian population. We found a tendency of in creased expression of ATG16L1 in tumor samples when compared with the normal tissue. In conclusion, ATG16L1 T300A polymorphism may influence susceptibility to gastric cancer, mainly for the non cardia and intestinal type in Eastern Europe.

Gliomas are the most frequent primary brain tumor of adults. Gliomas with oligodendroglial component (oligodendrogliomas) are relatively rare and associated with longer survival than astrocytic gliomas (astrocytomas). Cellular and morphological distinction between oligodendroglioma and astrocytoma can be subjective with inter observer variability. It is well established the impact of co deletion of chromosomes 1p36 and 19q13 in oligodenrogliomas. There is also a high incidence of 1p and 19q deletion in oligoastrocytic glial tumors (oligoastrocytomas). Co deletion of 1p/19q is associated with a positive prognosis and survival. These deletions occurred in 60 70% of oligodendrogliomas and they are less common astrocytomas (about10 20 %). Based on our literature search and best knowledge, the frequency and impact of polysomy status for given chromosomes have not been deeply investigated. In this study we have evaluated the polysomy status of 1p/19q in 45 paraffin embedded tissue of oligoastrocytomas by using florescent in situ hybridi zation (FISH). Tumors were 33 oligoastrocytoma (OAs) WHO Grade II, 11 oligoastrocytoma WHO Grade III, and 1 glioblastoma multiforme with oligo dendroglial component (GBM O).

MGMT en zyme repairs DNA alkylation damage, introduced by classical chemotherapy, and also the double strand braking points introduced during radiotherapy. Epigenetic inactivation by promoter methylation of the MGMT gene is very well established. This gene is epigenetically silenced in a variety of cancers, especially glioblastomas, colon cancer, non small cell lung cancer, gastric carcinoma, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma and also in Ewing sar coma tumors. Materials and methods. Ewing sarcoma tumors (2 specimens) were collec ted from diagnosed patients. Methylation specific (MS) PCR and Methylation specific MLPA methods were used for estimation of the MGMT transcription state through its promoter methylation pattern. Neste MSPCR was used in stead of classical MSPCR in order to increase the sensibility and specificity of the method. Results: The nested MSPCR gave better and clear results as compared with classical and MSMLPA methods. Certain specific conditions for optimization are described. The Nested MSPCR method proved its efficiency in characterizing the me thylation pattern of MGMT gene. The clinical significance of this estimation is linked with the repair capacity of the MGMT enzyme of the tumour dama ge introduced by classical (alkylating) chemotherapy and radiotherapy.

Even though there are significant developments on the anti cancer treatment, but 5 year survival rates were not significantly improved. In literature, it has been discussed that the main failure of treatment was related to cancer stem cell (CSC) behaviours due to many challenges in the targeted therapies. Mela tonin and like chemicals have been used for different diseases. Some studies showed that melatonin is affective on cancer in different ways. However, there is no data about the effect of melatonin on CSCs in the literature. In the present study, we aimed to investigate the effect of melatonin on apoptosis and differentiation in breast CSCs in vitro. Materials and methods: After appropriate treatment time and dose (IC50) were determined by using MTT , MCF7 breast cancer and HEK293 control cells were treated with melatonin. The effects of melatonin on apoptosis, number of CSCs and differentiation were evaluated by flow cytometry with Annexin V, CD44+/CD24 markers and MTT , respectively. In order to con firm the FACS results, apoptotic pathway target BAX ve BCL 2 and CSC mar ker genes ( SOX2, NANOG and OCT4) were analysed by using qPCR. Results and conclusion: Melatonin increases apoptosis and differentiation in the MCF7 CSCs, but it decreases both in control. This result indicates that the effect of melatonin needs to be studied on the other pathways in order to clarify the therapeutic effect in vitro and in vivo experiments.

There are few data re garding the HER 2 status in the corresponding distant metastases. Several papers have shown that HER2 status may be different in metastatic lesions when compared with the primary tumor, and this discrepancy is more fre quently found in distant metastases than in locoregional ones. Methods: HER 2 status in 47 patients with a primary breast tumour (at different time of therapy stages) and at least one distant metastatic (bone, brain, lung, liver, or other) lesion was analysed by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and chromogenic in situ hybridization (CISH).Results: The overall concordance rate for HER2 was 91.48%. Thirty four cases were concordantly HER2 negative in primary BC and distal metasta ses, nine cases were HER2 positive in both primary and metastatic tumors, and 4 cases were discordantly HER2 positive in the primary BC and HER2 negative in the metastases. Conclusion: Simultaneous determination of HER2 in BC and corresponding distant metastases is not mandatory, but may influence the therapeutic ma nagement.

The purpose of our study was the investigation the relationships between namely CAT C262T , GPX1 Pro198Leu as well as GSTP1 Ile105Val polymor phisms and the risk of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Genotyping of the mentioned polymorphisms were based on a multiplex polymerase chain reactions and restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR RFLP) methods in 100 AML patients and 200 healthy controls. We ob served that variant genotypes of CAT C262T gene polymorphism were not associated with the risk of AML. Our findings showed that the variant homo zygous genotypes of GPX1 Pro198Leu and GSTP1 Ile105Val polymorphis ms were associated with an increased risk of developing AML (p<0.0001, p,0.012). The combined variant genotypes of all three investigated poly morphisms were analyzed in relation to FLT3 andDNMT3A gene mutations. No significant associations between investigated polymorphisms and these parameters (p value > 0.05)were found. In conclusion, our data suggests that GPX1 Pro198Leu and GSTP1 Ile105Val variants seem to have an important role in development of AML.

It occurs either balanced t(1;19) or unbalanced der(19)t(1;19) where the TCF3/PBX1 fusion protein is associated with pre B cell immunophenotype in both situa tions. Here we present 4 years old girl who was referred because of wea kness and bone pain. She had hepatosplenomegaly and ecchymosis lesions at lower limbs. After routine laboratory investigations and flow cytometry she was diagnosed as pre B ALL. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis at diagnosis revealed mosaic pattern which included 35% of balan ced t(1;19) and 16% of unbalanced der(19)t(1;19). Following ALLIC BFM 2002 treatment protocol control FISH analysis was revealed chromosomal constitution normal. However 21% of der(19)t(1;19) was detected before reinduction therapy. She is still receiving maintenance treatment which is planned to continue for 6 months. Literature search revealed that derivative chromosome 19 is more common than balanced t(1;19). In conclusionhere we present a further pre B ALL patient which is characterised by an interesting shifted translocation pattern with good prognosis.,2015
24726,"AbstractBackground: Breast cancer is a clinically heterogeneous and complex disor der and its transformation can occur in different shapes which may be ma nifested as identical clinicopathologic indices. MDM4 is a negative regulator of the p53 tumor suppression pathway. Different researchers have revealed that the rs4245739A>C polymorphism of MDM4 in 3 untranslated regions makes it a miR 191 target site which leads to lower MDM4 expression. On the other side, the importance of Arg72Pro polymorphism of p53 in breast cancer has been proven. The aim of this study was to therefore realize the correlation of these SNPs and the risk of breast cancer in East Azerbaijan, Iran. Methods: 199 healthy controls and 206 women with breast cancer from Eastern Azerbaijan, Iran were included. Tetra ARMS PCR was employed in order to detect alleles of both positions. SPSS for Windows (version 22.0, IBM SPSS Inc., USA) and the SHEsis online software was exerted for allele typing, genotyping and haplotype analysis. Results: Different alleles of both MDM4 rs4245739 and p53 Arg72Pro had no significant frequency in cases when compared to the control (P>0.05). Also, genotypes of neither MDM4 rs4245739 nor p53 Arg72Pro were shown to increase or decrease breast cancer risk in patients in comparison to healthy women. Gene gene interaction also could not significantly affect the risk of breast cancer. Conclusion: Our ungoing study revealed that two genetic variants, MDM4 rs4245739 and p53 Arg72Pro polymorphisms failed to be associated, alo ne and in their combination, with the risk of breast cancer development in Iranian Azeri Patients. However, additional well designed studies on larger populations are required to validate this associatio",2015

24729,"Background & objective: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most common malignancies and the third leading cause of cancer mortality worldwide. Ti mely detection of CRC in patients in the earlier stages of disease provides the highest rate of survival. Epigenetic alterations which play a significant role in tumorogenesis are prevalent among CRC patients and represent as the primary modifications of cancer cells, therefore, these alterations are thought to hold great promise as tumor biomarkers. It has been shown that NTRK3 and SEPT9 gene promoters are hypermethylated and can be used as biomarkers for early detection of CRC. In this study we analyzed promoter methylation status of these genesÃ¢ÂÂ in CRC patients. Materials & methods: Genomic DNA was extracted from 45 CRC and paired adjacent normal tissues and undergone bisulfite conversion. Finally, the me thylation status of NTRK3 and SEPT9 were defined with the Methylation Specific High Resolution Melting (MS HRM) method. Results: Our results showed that there are statistically significant differences in the methylation status of NTRK3 and especially SEPT9 between CRC and adjacent normal tissues (p value,0.05 and 0.02 respectively).Conclusion: SEPT9 promoter hypermethylation might play a role as a tru sted biomarker for detection of CRC development; however, to validate the biomarker potential of NTRK3 there is a substantial need for further inve stigations.

24730,"Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most lethal malignancies in the world. It is the third most common cancer and a leading cause of cancer related death. There has been much interest in the development and use of mole cular based research aimed at identifying biomarkers for the diagnosis of the disease. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) has a crucial role in tumor angiogenesis and is found to be overexpressed and involved in the development and progression of CRC. Moreover, its over expression is fre quently considered as a marker of both, a poor prognosis and of an aggres sive tumor phenotype. Thus, the aims of this study were to quantitatively examine the expression of VEGF in tumor and marginal tissue in CRC and to correlate their expression levels with clinico pathological variables. Human colorectal cancer tissues (n,45) and non tumor (marginal) tissues (n,45) which were all pathologically diagnosed, were obtained after surgery. After RNA extracting from frozen pieces for gene amplification, the expression of VEGF were assessed using Real Time PCR subsequently after cDNA synthe sis by polyA RT PCR. VEGF expression was significantly raised in the tumor than in the non tumor tissues (P < 0.005). And its expression was lower in patients with stage I than in patients with higher clinical stages. In conclusi on, our data suggests that dysregulated VEGF gene expression is potentially involved in the carcinogenesis of CRC and the clinical outcome could be rela ted to its over expression in CRC patients. Hence, VEGF may has prognostic and therapeutic values in them.",2015

We examined Arg > Pro in codon 72 (rs1042522) and 16 bp insertion in intron 3 (rs17878362) in 80 gastric cancer patients after surgical treatment and chemotherapy with 5 fluorouracil. Determination of allelic imbalance of the locus 17p13 (TP53) in tumor samples from 80 gastric cancer patients was performed by microsatellite analysis. We have found the Pro/Pro genotype to be associated with poor progno sis, development of local recurrence, carcinomatosis, appearance of distant metastases during the first 3 years after surgery and 5 FU treatment (p , 0.031). There is a statistically significant increase in disease free survival in patients with Arg/Arg genotype, compared to the Pro/Pro (p , 0.013) and a statistically significant increase in disease free survival with geno type Arg/Pro vs. Pro/Pro (p , 0,015).

Introduction: The diagnosis of gliomas is mainly based on the 2007 WHO classification, which suffers from a lack of precision and reproducibility. No wadays, the search for genetic alterations in gliomas shows a potential role in diagnosis, prognosis and response to treatment. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the presence and the frequency of some genetic biomarkers in Moroccan diffuse glioma patients. Materials and Methods: 99 tumor samples were used for this study. They were obtained from patients diagnosed with glioma at the University Hospi tal Hassan II of Fez between January 2010 and December 2013.Immunohistochemistry was performed with the antibody directed against the internexin alpha (INA) which is used as a surrogate marker of 1p / 19q codeletion in oligodendroglial tumors. We performed a RT PCR to study EGFR and MDM2 genes amplification in glioblastomas and sequencing techniques to detect mutations in IDH genes in diffuse gliomas. Results: INA immunostaining was found in 80% of patients presenting an oligodendroglial tumor. We identified IDH1 mutation in 43 cases while one IDH2 mutation was detected in an anaplasic oligodendroglioma. The detection of EGFR/MDM2 amplification with RT PCR techniques is still in process. This study will focus on the presence and the frequency of these markers. These data should be compared with literature.

Genetic screening for patients with early onset breast canser (premenoposal or < age 50) and over cancer at any age, is increasingly rising in our country. Here we report a 41 year old premenoposal woman who have had bilateral total mastectomy for invasive ductal carcinoma of right breast for 7 years ago and left breast for 2 years ago. DNA sequence analyses for BRCA 1 and 2 genes were performed for the patient having not any familial history. The analysis revealed a fra meshift mutation on the sixth exon of BRCA 2 gene (c.506 ins A mutation). This new frameshift mutation is not reported on literature or any databases.

KRAS is very important oncogene, which leads to the overexpression of ras prote in, suppression of apoptosis, promoting the pathogenesis and development of tumours. Variant (rs61764370) of the let 7 miRNA complementary site of KRAS gene 3Ã¢ÂÂ untranslated region (KRAS LCS6) has been shown to disrupt the ability of miRNAs to target genes resulting in differential target mRNA and protein expression.

In the present study we assessed the relationship between IL 33 and ADAMTS5 in GBM tumorigenesis. For this purpose, ADAMTS5 protein was initially determined in samples from GBM and low grade tumor tissues (LGTt) and in samples from healthy brain tissues by western blot. We found that ADAMTS5 protein was significantly increased in both GBM and LGTt compared to healthy brain tissues (5,56 fold). Then, we performed primary tumor cell cultures derived from both GBM and LGTt.

Male breast cancer is a disease that affects approximately one in 1,000 men. Several risk factors influence the occurrence of this disease: age of diagno sis, unhealthy lifestyle and different genetic factors, such as mutations in BRCA genes. Mutations in BRCA2 gene are more frequent (incidence bet ween 4 40%) than in BRCA1 gene (incidence less than 10%).Our aim was to analyze the presence of pathogenic mutations in BRCA genes in 34 men with breast cancer divided in two groups: 15 with family history of breast cancer and 19 without it, all from the western part of the Spanish Castilla y LeÃÂ³n Community. The analysis of point mutations was performed by PCR, CSGE and Sanger sequencing in both BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes. When no cause disease mu tations were detected, a further analysis of genomic rearrangements was performed using a MLPA test. All mutations detected in our study were found in BRCA2 gene and in males with family history. We found a nonsen se mutation (c.145G>T) in one patient and the same frameshift mutation (c.2808_2811delACAA) in three others. Besides, we found 18 polymorphis ms in BRCA2 and 10 in BRCA1 in patients of both groups. We did not find pathogenic mutations in patients without a family history. In conclusion, we show that mutations tend to appear in the BRCA2 gene in a minority of patients with family history, which may be indicative of the existence of other genes associated with male breast cancer still unknown and should help to modify inclusion criteria in screening programs.

24749,"Introduction: Hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndrome (HBOC) is mainly caused by pathogenic mutations in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes. The detection of unclassified variants (UVs) is one of the main difficulties in the diagnosis of this syndrome. The pathological characterization of these unclassified variants is an indispensable tool for providing effective genetic counselling and preventive actions for these families. Materials and methods: To assess the abnormal splicing of twenty UVs iden tified in BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes in families from the South Catalonia region, a combination of several methods has been used, including in silico predic tion tools to assess they putative effect and mRNA analysis. A comparison of the mRNA results and splicing prediction bioinformatic methods has also been performed. Results: Four of the variants detected have been previously reported. Two variants of BRCA1 gene (c.331+1G>A, c.5397 1G>A) and one of BRCA2 gene (c.744+2T>A) showed an abnormal splicing pattern also predicted by the bioinformatic programs, and they had been previously reported. The rest of the UVs analyzed did not show an abnormal splicing effect at RNA level. Of these 17 UVs all were novel except c.9729+9A>C (BRCA2) that had been previously reported. Conclusions: Consistent with previous reports, our study shows that the combination of several in silico methods yields highly accurate information, making it a reliable tool for selecting those variants for sequencing mRNA analysis.

Moreover, the reduction in lamin A expression ABSTRACTS PUBLISHED ABSTRACTS ESHG 2015 | GLASGOW, SCOTLAND, UK | WWW. ESHG. ORG 444Back to inde x was correlated with the loss of epithelial membrane antigen (EMA)/MUC 1, an epithelial marker that is involved in the epithelial to mesenchymal tran sition (EMT). Finally, the decrease in lamin A expression was correlated with an increased number of lung adenocarcinoma metastatic sites, with a prefe rential localization in bone. We also hypothesized that lamin A expression could be regulated by other mechanisms, such as SRSF1, a LMNA splicing factor, or MALAT 1, a long, non coding nuclear RNA, which negatively controls miR 9 expression and is implicated in SRSF1 regulation. Both SRSF1 and MALAT 1 are known to be involved in metastasis development in lung cancer. In conclusion, low lamin A but not lamin C expression in pleural metastatic cells could indicate the lung origin of pleural metastatic adenocarcinomas and could represent a pejorative marker associated with the EMT and me tastatic potential.

24752,"Aim. Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a heterogeneous disease. CRC with perito neal carcinomatosis (PC) is most unfavorable prognosis group. Molecular classification of CRC (Sadanandam et al., 2013) defined five distinct molecu lar subtypes based on the preferentially expressed genes: stem like, SFRP2; transit amplifying, CFTR; goblet like, MUC2 and TFF3; enterocyte, MUC2 without TFF3; inflammatory, RARRES3. CRC groups have differences in pro gnosis and vary in degree of response to chemotherapy. Methods. We analyzed 27 tumors obtained from patients with PC and 45 stage I III CRC, among last ones six samples were obtained from patients with Lynch syndrome (LS). Subtypes classification was validated by analy zing 6 gene expression signature by RT PCR. KRAS /BRAF mutations were analyzed by sequencing. Results. The various subtypes frequency in CRC with PC and stage I III was: stem like 44.5% (12/27) and 15.6% (7/45); transit amplifying 37% (10/27) and 57.8% (26/45); goblet like subtype 3.7% (1/27) and 13.3% (6/45); enterocyte 7.4% (2/27) and 4.4% (2/45); inflammatory 7.4% (2/27) and 8.9% (4/45), respectively. LS tumors were: 3 inflammatory; 2 goblet like and 1 transit amplifying subtypes. KRAS/BRAF mutations were detected in 70.4% CRC with PC (19/27) and 46.7% (21/45) in stage I III CRC. Four from 5 BRAF V600E mutations was found in stem like sub type. Conclusion. The prevalence stem like subtype in CRC with PC and its associa tion with BRAF mutation confers aggressiveness, high metastatic potential and poor prognosis of this subtype. LS tumors belonged to more favorable subtypes that confirm the markedly better prognosis for them.

The mutation in BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes are mainly involved in just 15% to 20% of all heredita ry form of breast cancer but there is still a major proportion of hereditary breast cancer with no BRCA mutation detected. It has been proposed that a significant number of breast cancers are caused by defects in larger number of moderate or low penetrance genes. CHEK2 is a third high breast cancer susceptibility gene with low penetrance alleles that has been shown to best explain residual non BRCA aggregation of breast cancer. CHEK2 acts as a tu mor suppressor gene that directly regulates the functions of p53 and BRCA1 in response to DNA breakage which stopped cell proliferation and initiates DNA repair.

To extend the data, genome wide expression data was retrieved from eleven ALL datasets via the Gene Expression Om nibus (GEO). The dataset contained expression data for 618 diagnosed,168 relapsed ALL samples and nine healthy controls. Data analysis was carried out in the R environment. Results: Matched diagnosis/early relapse ALL samples clustered closely together and limited gene showed significant differences that involved in cell cycle regulation and apoptosis. Probe sets 1343 total were identified significantly different at diagnose who had not shown relapse compared to diagnose samples that relapsed in the future. Interestingly, various tran scription factors had been down regulated in relapse diagnose samples. ALL subgroups also compared with their controls. Leukemia samples showed aberrant expression of transcription factors that involved with MAPK and cell lineage pathways. Conclusions: We have identified potential genes and pathways at relap se and initial diagnose that may play a direct role in drug resistance and leukemia development in childhood ALL.

24761,"With the aim to receive additional information on mechanism of clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) progression and development biomarkers we studied two groups of genes. The first was made up of genes with the most expression. By bioinformatic analysis of gene expression databases 200 genes were selected. After quantitative RT PCR of ccRCC sample in compa rison with normal renal tissue 21 genes with the most frequent increased expression were identified. The majority of these genes were direct targets of HIF1ÃÂ±. It was found an association of six gene decreased expression (CA9, NDUFA4L2, VWF, IGFBP3, EGLN3, BHLHE41) with overall survival (OS) and genes VWF, IGFBP3,STC2 with metastasis (p , 0,008 0,044). Among these genes were as novel, without established significance in ccRCC, as NDUFA4L2 (OR , 0,048; 95% CI: 0,005 0,444), so well known biomarkers, as CA9. The second group was formed of genes participate in angiogenesis (5 genes), PI4K AKT mTOR pathway (10 genes) and EGFR. Only VEGFR1 and VEGFA decreased expression were interconnected with both OS and metastasis (p , 0,009 0,023). Increased expression in significant association with OS was observed for SAA1 and three genes CSF1R, Fn1 and C1QA tended to be increased. All these genes are associated with inflammatory response. The data give a possibility for proposition of consistent involvement HIF1A > HIF2A > NF kB/STATs modules, which can lead to the development of metastasis and reduced OS. Thus, for the first time shown coordinated ex pression decreasing of number of regulated HIF1ÃÂ± genes in connection with OS and metastasis.",2015
24762,"Non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is characterized by multiple genetic alterations such as loss of heterozygosity (LOH), microsatellite instability (MSI), promoter hypermethylation and changes of miRNA expression. Ac cording to a field cancerization (FC) phenomenon the adjacent histologically normal tissue plays an important role in tumor progression by triggering the transformation process. The aim of the study was the analysis of genetic alterations in tumor and adjacent tissue to determine the FC size and to reveal associations with clinico morphological features of patients. The study group included 135 patients with NSCLC. From each patient 4 FFPE samples were analyzed: tumor, adjacent normal lung tissue at 2, 5, 10 cm. LOH/MSI analysis was evaluated by PCR using 7 microsatellite loci. Promoter hypermethylation in genes RASSF1A FHIT , DAPK1, CDH1, CD44, TIMP3, MGMT was investigated by methyl sensitive PCR. The expression le vels of miRNAs let 7a, miR 155, miR 205 were measured by real time PCR. Our results demonstrated that LOH/MSI occurs only in tumor while promo ter hypermethylation occurs also in adjacent tissue at 2, 5 cm, but not at 10 cm. The downregulation of let 7a, miR 155 in adjacent tissue is lower than in tumor. The levels of investigated miRNAs in adjacent tissue vary depen ding on tumor differentiation in patients with differentiated tumors it is higher than in the group with poorly differentiated tumors. We postulate that FC size in NSCLC is at least 5 cm from tumor and includes only epigenetic but not structural (LOH/MSI) alterations. The evaluation of epigenetic changes in adjacent tissue (e.g., surgical margins) can potentially be used for postsurgical prognosis.",2015
24763,"Background. IDH mutations are linked to an altered methylome phenotype in gliomas, involving key genes participating in cell growth, development, cell cycle and metabolism. Our aim was to search for IDH1/2 mutations in correlation with promoter methylation for MGMT , APC, PTEN, RASSF1, DAPK1 and MLH1 genes in an effort to delineate their possible role in the pathogenesis of meningiomas. Methods: 75 meningiomas were examined (grade I n,42, grade II n,26, gra de III n,6). Methylation and mutation status were assessed by HRM, pyrose quencing/or Sanger sequencing. Results. IDH1 mutations at codon 132 were observed in 5% of the cases, with only 1 case bearing the hot spot mutation p. R132H. IDH2 mutations were recorded in three cases including two silent mutations, (p. D117V, p. R172R, p. L143L). A varying level of promoter methylation for APC, RASSF1A, MGMT , DAPK, hMLH1 was detected in 37%, 25%, 41%, 41%, 28% of the cases respectively. 75.5% of the samples showed methylation at one or more promoters, in 14%, 30%, 22%, 8% of the cases for one, two, three or four promoters respectively. All IDH1/2 mutant samples displayed concur rent methylation of two or three promoters. No statistical associations were elicited between methylation, mutations and grade. Conclusion. This report is the first to analyse simultaneously the presence of IDH1/2 mutations along with methylation status of five promoters in a cohort of meningioma samples of different grades.

24764,"Female Peutz Jeghers syndrome (PJS) patients have a highly increasedcancer risk, including breast cancer (BC). Risk estimates for BC in these patients vary, while information on clinical and histological characteristics is scarce. In the present study, we assessed the BC risk andclinicopathological features of BC in a large PJS cohort, and sought to formulate a present day BC surveillance recommendation. Cases were iden tified from the Dutch PJS cohort. PJS was diagnosed according to interna tional criteria. Clinical data were collected and radiological and histological data were reviewed. Cumulative BC risks were calculated by Kaplan Meier analysis and relative risk by Poisson regression analysis. Of 145 PJS patients, 75 (52%) were female. Nine women from 8 families were diagnosed with BC at a median age of 50 years (range 34 61). Mammography allowed good visibility of all but one BC. The majority of analysed BCs was of good or intermediate differentiation grade and all in vasive tumours were hormone sensitive and Her2 negative. Cumulative BC risk was 62% (95% CI 31% 93%) at age 65, and relative risk was 6 (95% CI 3 to 13, p<0.001) compared to the age matched general population. BC risk for female PJS patients is highly increased, approaching that of BRCA mutation carriers, while PJS associated BCs seem to have a later onset and more favourable clinicopathological characteristics than BRCA mutation carriers. We propose to start annual BC surveillance with mammography in female PJS patients as of 30 years, with additional MRI in patients with dense breast tissue. Prospective evaluation of this schedule is required to determine its effectiveness.",2015

24766,"Background: Suppressor of cytokine signaling 1 (Socs1) protein plays an essential role in inhibition of JAK STAT pathway, which is important for dif ferentiation, proliferation and apoptosis of cells involved in tumorogenesis. Hypermethylation of the promoter CpG islands in the Socs1 gene is an epige netic phenomenon associated with gene silencing that leads to inactivation of this tumor suppressor gene function in colorectal cancer (CRC).The aim of this study was to determine the methylation status of Socs1 gene promo ter in colorectal neoplasms. Materials and Methods: We investigated the aberrant methylation status of Socs1 gene in 37 polyp and 13 tumor biopsies obtained from participants (24 female and 26 male with age of 53ÃÂ±26) and 50 corresponding nonma lignant epithelium, by methylation specific PCR (MS PCR). Tissue samples were collected during 2011 to 2013, after colonoscopy from participants. Informed consent was obtained from patients. Results: Eighteen percent (8 of 50) of the studied biosies were found to have methylated CpG islands in Socs1 gene promoter region. There was a significant association between promoter methylation and size of neoplas ms. Frequency of promoter methylation was higher in smaller neoplasms under 10 mm in size. None of the nonmalignant epithelium samples were methylated in the promoter region. Concussion: Detection of Socs1 promoter methylation in colon neoplasms may provide an informative approach for early detection of CRC. Key words: Socs1 , Methylation, MSP , Colon neoplasm",2015
24767,"The autosomal recessively inherited form of colorectal adenomatosis poly posis (FAP2) results from homozygous or compound heterozygous mutati ons in the MUTYH gene. MUTYH, the human homologue of the E.coli mutY gene, is involved in base excision repair and cellular response to oxidative DNA damage. Two founder mutations (c.536A>G and c.1187G>A) account for the majority of pathogenic mutations reported to date. Carriers of two mutated alleles, who generally have onset of Ã¢ÂÂattenuated polyposisÃ¢ÂÂ as young adults, have a high risk of colorectal cancer, as well as some increase in the incidence of duodenal, gastric, endometrial and breast cancers. Data regar ding polyp and cancer risk in monoallelic mutation carriers are limited and conflicting, with some evidence for an increased incidence of colorectal and breast cancers. In addition, until the recent inclusion of MUTYH in multige ne cancer risk panels offered on a clinical basis, little was known of other mutations, hence the high rate of Variants of Unknown Significance (VUS) in clnical testing. Our experience with mutations and variants in the MUTYH gene (see selected cases in Table 1) suggests that cancer risk has been unde restimated in monoallelic carriers, and that it may be appropriate to follow individuals with one or two MUTYH mutations as we do individuals with Lynch syndrome (Hereditary Non Polyposis Colorectal Cancer, HNPCC).

Therefore we in vestigated copy number variation anomalies (CNVs) in genes related to co lorectal cancer using MLPA technique (Multiplex ligation dependent probe amplification) in 16 samples obtained from colorectal carcinoma. The total of 16 tissue samples were obtained by biopsy of 8 patients with CRC, being 8 neoplastic samples and 8 samples obtained from adjacent regions (10cm distant tumor tissue).

24769,"Basal cell carcinoma (BCC) is the most common malignant neoplasm in humans; however, it has not been studied by international cancer consorti ums. Most BCCs are caused by aberrant activation of the hedgehog pathway (SHH) by PTCH1 mutations. BCCÃ¢ÂÂs varying morphology and aggressiveness, as well as their response to SMO inhibitors, may be associated with the ac quisition of secondary driver mutations. To characterize the genomic landscape of BCC, we performed exome se quencing of frozen material from 50 cases/matching germline samples and a validation cohort of 100 FFPEs. BCCs have ~88 SNVs/Mb; much higher than all other tumors, including melanoma. In all cases, primary drivers in PTCH1, SMO or TP53 were identified. As expected in tumors with high mutation rates, we observe secondary driver mutations in 55% of cases; remarkably, we detect additive activation of SHH downstream of SMO GLI by MYCN (40% of cases), PPP6C (15%) and FBXW7 (6.5%) mutations. We experimentally determined that MYCN mutations promote N Myc stabiliza tion by impairing its ubiquitination by FBXW7. N Myc stabilization, trunca ting FBXW7 mutations, and PPP6C p. R264C mutations found in our cohort are all known to stabilize AuroraA. We further show activation of the HIPPO pathway (30% of cases); we observe truncating mutations in PTPN14, invol ved in cytoplasmic sequestration of YAP1. Immunohistochemistry confirms the enrichment of nucleus localized YAP1 in PTPN14 mutated tumors. This study is the most comprehensive and integrative analysis of BCC to date. We provide new insights into mechanisms mediating resistance to SMO in hibitors via secondary oncogenic mutations and we report MYCN oncogenic point mutations for the first time.",2015

24771,"Introduction :In Reunion Island, we have chosen to study the BRCA 1/2 mutation carriers, and thus to search for the presence of a founder mutation. Methods :This study is a retrospective, multicentric one, over 10 years, about 65 sub jects, who are carrying a BRCA 1/2 mutation. Their epidemiologic characteristics, as well as the all cancer and mutation characteristics, were analysed. We have also compared the initial breast cancers of this population with the french national cohorte GENEPSO. Results: A specific mutation was found, the 2840C>A (exon 11) of the BRCA 2 gene, wich concerned 37 % of the ReunionÃ¢ÂÂs BRCA carriers. An usually BRAC 2 mutations number was also observed, with 70 % of the subjects, against 35% of the GENEPSO cohorte. Conclusion : This particular BRCA mutations distribution is related to ethnic and cultural history of the Reunion Island, with a mixed population but compartmen talized in its sociodemographic functioning. CancerÃ¢ÂÂs characteristics of this population appear to be usual, however this study shows the importance of hereditary risk factors cancer screening. It has to be based on a suggestive family history, but also on tumorous characteristics, like a triple negative profile before 50 years. This study underlines the presence of a probable founder mutation, specific of Reunion Island. We didnÃ¢ÂÂt found difference between Reunion or French BRCA mutation carriers, especially for the initial breast cancers, except younger age of oc curence, less triple negative breast tumors, and a statistically significant high proportion of BRCA 2 gene mutations.",2015
24772,"Recent studies indicate that 40% of chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) pati ents who achieve sustained undetectable BCR ABL1 transcripts on tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapy remain disease free after drug discontinua tion. In contrast, 60% experience return of detectable disease and have to re start treatment, thus highlighting the need for an improved method of identifying patients with the lowest likelihood of relapse. Here we descri be the validation of a personalised DNA based digital PCR approach for quantifying very low levels of residual disease, which involves the rapid identification of BCR ABL1 fusion junctions using targeted next generation sequencing coupled with the use of a digital PCR (dPCR) platform. BCR ABL1 genomic breakpoints were successfully mapped in samples from 32 of 32 patients with early disease. Disease quantification by DNA dPCR was performed using the Fluidigm BioMark platform on 46 follow up samples from 6 of the 32 patients, including 36 samples that were in deep molecu lar remission (MR). Digital PCR detected persistent disease in 81% of MR samples, out performing both RT dPCR (25%) and DNA based qPCR (19%). We conclude that dPCR for BCR ABL1 DNA is the most sensitive available method of residual disease detection in CML and may prove useful in the management of TKI withdrawal.

T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T ALL), is a severe disease that occurs in the malignant transformation of T cells in the thymus. Here we performed whole genome expression analysis in 31 T ALL childhood patients. In additi on to some well known targets a new target has been identified in the patient group SnoN/SKIL gene, known as a regulator of TGF ÃÂ² pathway, was down regulated when compared to thymocyte controls. Quantitative Real Time PCR and analysis of proteins by proximity ligation assay (PLA) also confir med this down regulation in a larger patient group (n,72). In the thought of the reasons of this downregulation, we searched the possible miRNAs that target SnoN/SKIL gene via online databases. Among these miRNAs we select mir 223, which is also known to be deregulated in hematologic malignan cies, and by Stemloop RT PCR we found out that all the samples with low SnoN/SKIL expression show high mir 223 expression levels. When we block mir223 in Molt4 cell line, by anti mir223 LNA in vitro, SnoN/SKIL expression was leveled up. In the same group when we checked the apoptosis levels by Annexin V flow cytometry assay we found out that when we block mir223, cells were lead to apoptosis almost 10 fold higher than untreated cells. Our study is still ongoing to validate the direct relation between SnoN/SKIL and mir223, but these preliminary results show that SnoN/SKIL gene, which is known to have dual role in different malignancies like being oncogene or tumor suppressor, might be acting as a tumor suppressor gene in T ALL.

Introduction: BRCA1 and BRCA2 germline mutations account for 5 10% of breast ovarian cancer families. A large majority of these familial aggregation remain unexplained. Recent studies report a 4 16% mutations prevalence when investigating other genes but BRCA1/2. New candidates are emerging. To further elucidate the role of these candidate genes in breast ovarian can cer susceptibility, we selected a cohort of BRCA1/2 negative index cases to be tested with a 29 genes panel. Patients and methods: 24 affected women with at least 3 first degree re latives diagnosed with breast/ovarian cancers were recruited in 4 familial clinics in Alsace province (France). A first capture panel of 29 genes was designed. Genomic DNA Library preparation was performed using the Su reSelect XTÃ¢ÂÂ¢ (Agilent) and sequenced with the MiSeqÃÂ® Sequencing System (Illumina). Primary analyses were performed via the MiSeq Reporter Soft ware, secondary analyses via an in house bioinformatic pipeline. Results: Sequencing (2x150bp) generated 7Gb of data, with 95% of the bases Ã¢ÂÂ¥QV30. All coding regions and intron exon jonctions were covered (mean depth of coverage 150X. Preliminary results revealed 2 deleterious mutations: 1 frameshift on PALB2, and 1 nonsense mutation on RAD51C. Variants of uncertain significance will be reported.

24775,"MicroRNAs comprise a family of small non coding RNA molecules that have emerged as key post transcriptional regulators of gene expression. Aber rant miRNA expression has been linked to various human tumors. This stu dy was aimed to identify novel miRNAs involved in the carcinogenesis of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) and their potential functions. We performed miRNA microarray and found that miR 330 3p was highly expressed in ESCC tumor tissues. Ectopic expression of miR 330 3p signi ficantly promoted ESCC cell proliferation, survival, migration, invasion in vitro and stimulated tumor formation in nude mice. Knockdown miR 330 3p expression leaded to the opposite effects. Further, we revealed that miR 330 3p could repress the expression of programmed cell death 4 (PDCD4) by targeting its 3Ã¢ÂÂ un translated region (UTR) and expression of PDCD4 was inversely associated with miR 330 3p in ESCC tissues. In addition, silencing of PDCD4 significantly promoted cell growth, cell migration, invasion and inhibited cisplatin induced apoptosis. In conclusion, our findings demon strated that miR 330 3p might play an oncogenic role in the development of ESCC partially via suppression of PDCD4 expression.",2015

The arecoline induced CAs was dose dependent in both CHO K1 and S G cells. The curve of dose CAs was slower in CHO K1 than S G cells. Surprisingly, we found that arecoline induced ROS in CHO K1 cell, but no ROS in S G cell. Conclusion:Based on these findings, we suggested that arecoline caused different toxic responses in different cell lines. The induced ROS attenuated the arecoline induced cytotoxicity and CAs in CHO K1 cells.",2015
24780,"Action mechanisms of cerium oxide nanoparticles (nanoCeO2) to the in tracellular signaling pathways, including conditions of oxidative stress at present is not entirely clear. The mechanism of the antioxidant properties of nanoCeO 2 associated with the presence on the surface of cerium ions in different oxidation states (Ce3 + and Ce4 +). On the one hand, nanoCeO2 can serve as free radical scavengers since they have mimetic activity as antioxi dant enzyme activity, such as superoxide dismutase and catalase. On the other hand, there is evidence confirming the effect of nanoCeO2 on intracel lular signaling pathways. We analyzed the expression levels of a wide range of target genes in human mesenchymal stem cells with combination of cerium dioxide nanoparticles (for 24 hours prior to irradiation at a dose of 10 7 M) and X ray dose of 15 Gy by RT PCR method. We showed that nanoCeO2 synthesized by citrate me thod, can regulate the expression of some enzymes (MnSOD, CuSOD, catala se, IL 1, IL 6, TNF a, iNOS), reducing the level of oxidative stress in the cell, thereby preventing the development of oxidative stress, induced by ionizing radiation. These data allow us to propose the assumption that nanoCeO 2 can act not only as a scavenger of reactive oxygen species and to modulate the metabo lic pathways functioning cells, causing the formation of a specific adaptive response. The obtained data can serve as the basis for the development of new highly selective radioprotective for clinical radiotherapy.

24781,"[Background] It is well known that confined placental mosaicism (CPM) is related to fetal growth restriction since chorionic villus sampling (CVS) has been becoming common. At our hospital, we experienced 4 cases of CPM in a few years and one of them had a hepatic tumor which is related to mo saicism. In this study, we focused on the frequency of CPM in the group of fetuses with anomalies not only fetal growth restriction.[Method] In Japan, CVS is not so common and select more amniocentesis still now, so we have done the karyotyping of neonates and placenta (with all three embryonic cell lineages) postnatally. We obtained the samples from neonates with anomalies such as dismorphologic features, growth restric tion and other problems including fetal death.[Results] In 55 cases since November 2013 to date, two cases were failed at culture because of severe infection. Only 1 case was diagnosed as CPM and that case was clinically diagnosed as fetal growth restriction. This is 0.26% of FGR cases and 0.18% of total, while Kalousek et al. reported the preva lence of CPM detected at term in FGR could be between 8% and 60%.[Conclusion] Against our hypothesis, fewer cases were diagnosed as CPM in this study. It suggests there might be some difficult point in diagnosing CPM at term pregnancy or the actual frequency of CPM would be rather low. We would like to continue this study with larger numbers to clarify the mecha nism and the clinical impact of CPM.",2015

Married couple had a healthy 9 year old child and 4 successive miscarriages, all at 5 6 weeks of pregnancy. First three abortions were spon taneous; the last was therapeutically induced . Family history revealed a si ster with a known recurrent fetal loss and an early death of a male child from epileptic seizures at 6 years of age. Chromosomal analysis for the patientÃ¢ÂÂs sister, parents, healthy child and husband revealed t(18;19)(p11.2;p13.1) at patientÃ¢ÂÂs sister and mother. Chromosomal analysis of the patient revealed the same translocation. Questions concerning the probability of a patient to have a successful pregnancy and the risk of having an affected child were raised. With genetic counseling, patient was advised to have PGD and subsequent IVF to prevent the possibility of having an affected child or a miscarriage. IMPA2 gene and is responsible for a production of childhood febrile seizures, corresponds to 18p11.2 locus, which has been translocated to patientÃ¢ÂÂs chromosome 19. Although patientÃ¢ÂÂs sisterÃ¢ÂÂs diseased epileptic child had no karyotyping, it is assumed that he had a chromosome with missing IMPase gene (chromosome 18 with a missing p11.2 locus), which caused decrease in IMPase production. Because of this occurrence, it is pos sible that the patient is also at risk of giving birth to a child with febrile epileptic seizures and migth result in early death of the child.",2015

The cytogenetic analysis is still useful for the establishment of diagnosis in genetic diseases and in Eastern Europe it is basically the initial genetic ana lysis. The aim of this study is to reveal heterogeneity of X chromosome pa thology among tested patients from the region of Varna, Eastern Bulgaria. Patients and Methods: Retrospective analysis in the Laboratory of Medical Genetics was performed to find out patients with X chromosome abnorma lities for a period of 12 years (2003 2014). These were cytogenetically ex amined phenotypic females and males at the age of a newborn to 53 years with indications: females with Turner like phenotype, infertility (sterility or recurrent spontaneous abortions), premature ovarian insufficiency (prima ry or secondary amenorrhea), and ambiguous genitalia (congenital adrenal hyperplasia included). Conventional karyotyping with G banding cytogene tic testing was performed. Results: Significant X chromosomal aberrations were found in 57 (9.86 %) of all 578 indicated patients. The most common finding was Turner syndrome confirmed diagnosis with classical monosomy X in 13 (22.8%) or mosaic va riants of numerical and/or structural abnormal cell lines of any known type 12 (21.0%) patients. Abnormal karyotype was found in 16(28.0%) (mostly females and one male) patients with infertility; 6 (10.5%) of females with premature ovarian insufficiency (reciprocal translocations of X chromoso me with an autosome), undifferentiated gender in 3 (5,3%), dysmorphism and mental retardation in 2 (3.5%).

We present a case with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), car rier of a Yqs with a deletion in Yq12. We also speculate about the possible role of genes on sex chromosomes as possible risk factors for ADHD. We present a 12 year old boy, second child of a mother who underwent amniocentesis for advanced maternal age. Karyotype in cultured amnio cytes and parental blood samples revealed the presence of a de novo Yqs in the fetus. Additional FISH studies showed the chromosome 15 origin of the Yq satellited material. Baby delivery was uneventful. After an apparently normal development, he presented learning difficulties and behavioral pro blems, compatible with ADHD. Arrays CGH studies, performed at the age of 12, identified the presence of a maternally inherited 152Kb duplication on 12q24.32 and a 242Kb deletion in the PAR2 region on the X or Y chromo some: arr[hg18]12q24.32(128224063 128376460)x3,Xq28(154600946 15843418)x1,Yq12(57460146 57702618)x1.

The presence of the deletion was ruled out in father by FISH analysis. Deletion of SPRY3 and VAMP7 genes on Yq12 cannot be considered the cau se of the ADHD phenotype, as these genes are genetically inactive in the Y chromosome in males.

24786,"Fanconi anaemia (FA) is an inherited DNA repair deficiency syndrome caused by biallelic mutations of 1 of the 15 FANC genes. FA cells feature a high frequency of broken and radial chromosomes and are highly sensiti ve to interstrand DNA crosslinks. Chromosomal aberrations are often as sociated with incomplete genome duplication following replicative stress. Common fragile sites (CFSs) are usually late replicating regions and it is now common opinion that their expression as chromosome gaps or breaks may be due to unreplicated DNA. Purpose: To study, within two CFSs, FRA2G and FRA2H, the relationship bet ween DNA replication timing and fragility in FA lymphoblasts mutated in the FANCA gene (FA A) and in the same cells transfected with normal FANCA gene (FANCA).Methods: FISH, using sequences mapping within our two CFRAs, on inter phase nuclei obtained from FA A, FANCA and control cells: each locus be fore replication appears as a single hybridization dot signal (S), while af ter replication duplicated dot signals (D) are visible. Five distinct temporal S phase stages can be distinguished from the G1 and G2 nuclei by adding BrdU twenty minutes prior to cell harvest and analysing the BrdU labelling patterns of the DNA replication. Results: Respect to control cells, in FA A and FANCA cells, the fragile se quences show a DNA replication stalling between the second and third stage of S phase. Moreover, while FA A cells reach the last phase with only a 55% of duplicated loci, FANCA cells show a more regular trend reaching, as the control cells, the last phase of S with about 69% of replicated alleles.

24788,"Introduction: Bardet Biedl syndrome (BBS, #209900) is a genetic rare di sease belonging to the group of ciliopathies. Since the molecular basis un derlying BBS is not fully understood and the real role of BBS variants has to be characterised, we aimed to analyse the functional implications of two BBS2 mutations (p. Tyr89Cys and p. Arg275*) predicted to alter the normal splicing process after transcription. Remarkably, BBS2 protein is part of the BBSome core complex, an important intermediate in the assembly of the mature BBSome, which is known to be involved in trafficking to ciliary mem brane. Materials and Methods: We performed mRNA expression studies by mini gene assay using pSPL3 vector and COS 7 cells for in vitro experiments. All minigene constructions and cDNA sequences were confirmed by direct se quencing. Results: The two mutations analysed here were not observed to affect mRNA processing, as wildtype and mutated constructions produced the same pat tern after agarose gel electrophoresis. Direct sequencing supported these negative results. Interestingly, we observed that nonsense mediated decay did not work when p. Arg275* variant was transcribed, since we detected the band corresponding to the mutated transcript. Conclusions: Although bioinformatic predictions are helpful to focus on molecular studies, biological experiments always have to confirm this data. Despite the negative results obtained here, we cannot discard any kind of alteration in BBS2 protein structure and/or function. Further studies will have to clarify the real role of these variants in DNA processing. Work supported by grants from Instituto de Salud Carlos III (PI12/01853). M Alvarez Satta and S.

The present study aims to investigate the HDFs growth rate in culture media supplemented either with or without bFGF. HDFs were isolated from human foreskin sample and were cultured in vitro in media containing bFGF and lack of this factor. The karyotyping was performed using G banding to investigate the chromosomal abnormality of HDFs in both groups. The real time Q PCR was used to measure the expressi on level of p27kip1 and cyclin D1 genes normalized to internal control gene (GAPDH). HDFs cultured in media or without bFGF had normal karyotype and chromosomal abnormalities were not observed. The cell growth rates in both groups were normal with proliferated exponentially but the slope of growth curve in HDFs cultured in media containing bFGF was increased. Karyotyp test showed bFGF does not affect on cytogenetic stability of cells. The survey of p27kip1 and cyclin D1 genes by real time Q PCR showed the expression level of these genes were up regulated when adding bFGF in cul ture media (p<0.05). This study demonstrates appropriate supplementation of culture media with growth factor like bFGF could enhance the prolifera tion and differentiation capacity of cells. Similarly, fibroblast growth factors did not induce any chromosomal abnormality in cells.

Mutagen induced DNA double strand breaks (DSBs), marked by ÃÂ³H2AX, in cells have traditionally been considered as dangerous pre mutation dama ge. However, the nature of spontaneous ÃÂ³H2AX foci is not clear. Purpose: To analyze the effect of spontaneous level of ÃÂ³H2AX foci on the spontaneous and radiation induced level of cytogenetic damage in human cells. Material and methods: Chromosome aberrations, micronuclei and ÃÂ³H2AX foci were assessed in lymphocytes of 54 healthy individuals and 11 patients with solid tumors, and extraembryonic fibroblasts of 18 human embryos. Results: There was no direct correlation between spontaneous level of ÃÂ³H2AX foci and spontaneous frequency of centromere negative micronu clei in both lymphocytes and extraembryonic fibroblasts. It suggests that not all spontaneous ÃÂ³H2AX foci, unlike the radiation induced ones, corre spond to DNA DSBs. Furthermore, after irradiation of lymphocytes from healthy individuals a negative correlation was found between spontaneous level of ÃÂ³H2AX foci and frequency of radiation induced centromere negative micronuclei (R, 0,37, p,0,025). Checking these results in vivo in the lym phocytes of cancer patients demonstrated that level of ÃÂ³H2AX foci before radiation therapy negatively correlated with the frequency of chromosome aberrations (mainly paired fragments) after the end of treatment (R, 0,73, p,0.024), reflecting the individual radiosensitivity. Conclusion: Although the spontaneous level of ÃÂ³H2AX foci does not reflect the actual number of chromosomal abnormalities, it may be a marker of in dividual DNA DSBs repair capacity in human cells.

The EBs were then cultured in four groups; three test groups (containing culture medium with siRNA) and the control (the same culture medium used in test group without siRNA). After three weeks, differentiated cells were analyzed by using RT PCR(expression of some pan creas specific genes), immunocytochemistry (detection of insulin presence in cells) and ELISA (evaluation of the amount of secreted insulin to culture medium). Results: The RT PCR analysis of differentiated cells on three test groups sho wed expression of beta cell specific markers including insulin and Pdx1. The results of immunostaining showed that the insulin protein are expressed in differentiated cell of Foxo1 siRNA group and Foxo1/Gcg siRNA group with different amounts and finally insulin secretion assay show that differen tiated cells on Foxo1 siRNA group secreted more insulin in comparison with the other groups.

24796,"K. Ammosov North Eastern Federal University, Yakutsk, Russian Federation. Distinctions between a pre replicative and post replicative chromatin re mained imperceptible so far and didnÃ¢ÂÂt draw attention of researchers. Ho wever they were important for an explanation of fundamental structurally functional properties of a chromatin. Replication of a threadlike chromatin doubles quantity of DNA in S period of an interphase. However, the quantity of the histone disks remains wit hout change. Therefore, replication forms a new post replicative form of a chromatin with double deficiency of histones (semihistonal chromatin or semichromatin). Spiralization and condensation are the main properties of a semichromatin. Semichromatin almost completely retained deficiency of histones and exposed to spiralization from interphase period G2 to a pro metaphase, i.e. before merging of a nucleoplasm to cytoplasm. Free histones of cytoplasm compensate for the deficiency of histones of a semichromatin of chromosomes during an anaphase and a telophase. In such a way semi chromatin of chromosomes turns in full on histones threadlike chromatin with a diameter of 11 nanometers. All interphase nuclei contain chromatin bodies and nucleoreticulum. Nuclei of female cells have still sex chromatin. All of them represent the remains of a semichromatin of chromosomes which didnÃ¢ÂÂt manage to fill completely the missing histones and kept a spiralized form of a post replicative chromatin. Preservation of the semichromatin parts of chromosomes in G1 period of an interphase can appear one of ways of long blocking of activity of seldom in cluded genes. It is possible to explain with this property of a post replicative chromatin the mechanism of blockade of genes of X chromosome in a sex chromatin.",2015

In about 50% of cases, karyotype analysis reveals the complete loss of one X chromo some, whereas the remaining patients display a multitude of chromosomal X abnormalities. Most people with TurnerÃ¢ÂÂs syndrome have normal intel ligence, however mental retardation was observed in patients with small ring X chromosome and terminal X deletions because of deletion of XIST or absence of skewed X inactivation, respectively. We report the case of a twelve year old girl who was referred to our gene tic clinic because of dysmorphic features, mental retardation and epilepsy. Craniofacial abnormalities included facial asymmetry, broad forehead, hy pertelorism, bulbous nose, puffy cheeks and lower lip thick. The height was 104 cm ( 4DS), and she had atrophy of the right hemicorpus, torso achromic lesions bands and absence of mammary development. Conventional cytoge netic analysis using G bands revealed a 45,X/46,X,del(X)(q21.1) karyotype. Parental karyotypes were normal. Array CGH refined the breakpoint loca tion on Xq21.1, showed the absence of deletion of XIST and revealed the absence of other pathogenic copy number variations (CNVs).

GJB2 gene affections are a frequent cause of hereditary NSHL with a wide spectrum of clinical data that ran ges from moderate to profound NSHL. Mexican population harbours a low frequency of GJB2 homozygous mutations in NSHL. In some cases, digenic inheritance is a cause of NSHL Objective: To describe two novel digenic mu tations in the GJB2 gene and OTOA and MYO1C genes in patients with NSHL in a sample of Mexican patients. Materials and methods: Two families with prelingual NSHL were included in the study. Genomic DNA was extracted by conventional methods for exome analysis in affected patients. DNA se quencing analysis was performed to confirm exome findings. Results The digenic inheritance corresponded to GJB2 c.35delG in both families and OTOA p. E787X and MYO1C p. E831K in each family, respectively; both genes associated to NSHL. Parents were tested for these gene mutations and they had the heterozygous state that allowed to confirm the recessive inheritance pattern. These mutations were searching in 100 normal controls to discard a possible polymorphism. Conclusion: We describe two novel digenic varie ties of homozygous mutations in patients with NSHL. All patients presented profound hypoacusia with no other anomalies. These data show the com plexity in the genesis of NSHL and that the genetic defects are greater than expected in Mexican population.",2015

Plasmid vectors are more preferable then viral ones since the former do not cause immune reaction, have relatively small size, and can be easily produ ced. Plasmid vectors do not integrate in chromosomes and are more stable. They might be used for treatment of monogenetic diseases, attribution new functions to cells, and various strategies for cancer therapy. However, no wadays plasmid vectors are not effective enough due to absence of stable bond with cell penetrating peptide (CPP). The earlier solutions of the pre sent problem were not successful enough. Non covalently modified vectors are too large and chemical modifications affect the target genes. We suggest plasmid modification with biotin. By means of biotin streptavidin interac tion this plasmid might be strongly bound with CPP .ProkaryoteÃ¢ÂÂs transcription occurs only on the anti sense strand of DNA and doesnÃ¢ÂÂt use the sense one. It allows the modification of the sense strand of plasmid to provide stable construction for gene therapy. Two types of plas mids were designed which contain green fluorescent protein gene down stream the eukaryotic promoter. In the first plasmid a part of thymine bases was replaced by biotinylated uracils on the sense strand of DNA. Similarly, in the second plasmid the anti sense strand of DNA was modified. The analysis of the biotinylated plasmid restriction fragments by immu noblotting confirms that both plasmids are biotinylated along the whole length. Peroxidase labeled streptavidin was used for detection. The ability of the plasmids obtained for expression of green fluorescent protein was tested on the HEK 293 cell line. Expression of the target gene was observed only in the case of the sense strand modification.",2015

About 60% of RSTS patients carry a heterozygous mutation in CREBBP or EP300 genes enco ding the homologous CBP and p300 acetyltransferase proteins that play a key role in DNA repair. In order to investigate a possible altered DNA damage response (DDR) con curring to RSTS pathogenesis we analyzed lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) derived from 5 patients carrying CREBBP (2 missense in KAT domain and a whole gene deletion) or EP300 (2 precocious frameshift) mutations to as sess their ability to respond to different types of DNA damage. All the analyzed RSTS cell lines showed i) signs of the presence of endoge nous DNA Damage, as assessed by the appearance of phosphorylated histo ne H2AX, ii) increased sensitivity to oxidative potassium bromate induced DNA damage and iii) significantly reduced ability to perform DNA incision after DNA damage, i.e. the first step of the base excision repair (BER) process carried out by a DNA glycosylase. The acetylation of DNA polymerase beta, DNA glycosylase OGG1, PCNA, histone H3 and also auto acetylation of CBP and p300 are all reduced in RSTS cells, suggesting a correlation with BER deficiency. All these findings support our rationale on impaired DDR, particularly at the level of BER, in RSTS cells, thus suggesting that full CBP/p300 activity is required for successful DNA damage removal and for maintainance of cell functions homeostasis.

We analyzed by clinical exome sequencing (CES) 130 patient parents trios aged under 14 years, affected by cardiovascular, liver or neurologic disorders with suspected genetic causes. Our aim was the substitution of traditional gene centered approach with a comprehensive analysis of all known disease genes. Of the 130 patients, 61 (47%) carried at least one potentially causative mu tation. Among them, 42 had an autosomal dominant disease of which 24 (57%) occurred de novo, 17 had autosomal recessive disease and two had X linked disease.

Objective: The project aimed at the identification of inherited or/ novel genome variants causing syndromic or non syndromic heart defects. Subjects & Methods: A total of 83 patients with CHD associated with deve lopmental delay or other malformations were recruited in the study. We ap plied conventional cytogenetic methods such as G banding and Fluorescent In Situ Hybridization (FISH) techniques concomitant with high density array CGH using 2X 400 oligo microarray (Agilent). We could detect chro mosome abnormalities in 11/83 (13%) cases using conventional cytogene tic techniques: Trisomy 18 (2), trisomy 13 (1), ring 18 (1), trisomy 9p (1), (del22q11.2) (3), (del7q11.23) (2), del 18(p11.32 p11.21) (1).

Mutations in SCN1A gene are the most common cause of generalized epilepsy with febrile seizures plus (GEFS+), severe myoclonic epilepsy of infancy (SMEI; Dravet syndrome) and rare cases of familial hemiplegic migraine. Selection of patients for genetic testing was carried out together with epileptologists among patients with idiopathic epilepsy (IE) observed in Medical Center. The five pathogenic mutations in SCN1A were determined in 45 patients: c.3022G>T , c.1144G>T , c.80G>C, c.3604C>T , c.1131A>C. The material from both parents was available for study in case of mutations detection c.80G>C and c.3604C>T . In the first fa mily, mutation c.80G>C was detected in the mother without clinical features of epilepsy. There were no similar changes of SCN1A gene in the parents of patient with c.3604C>T .

Background: CYP2D6 enzyme is responsible for the metabolism of antide pressants, including selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, such as fluoxe tine. Genetic variations in the highly polymorphic CYP2D6 gene may be as sociated with increased, reduced, or lost enzymeÃ¢ÂÂs activity, which can cause adverse drug reactions. Researchers discovered a link between fluoxetine use and suicidal behavior among teenagers. Case presentation: A 17 years old teenager, a girl, has been taking fluoxeti ne for three months following neurologistÃ¢ÂÂs advice as a treatment for mood instability with a prevalence of depressed mood. The teenager committed suicide. After analyzing the girlÃ¢ÂÂs diary, the psychiatrist made a conclusion that the girl had been suffering from schizotypal personality disorder. Geno typing showed the presence of heterozygous CYP2D6*4 allele (c.1846G>A) and heterozygous CYP2D6*10 allele (c.100C>T), which may determine de crease in CYP2D6 activity. No other genetic variants (CYP2D6*3, CYP2D6*6, CYP2D6*9, CYP2D6*41) were found. Forensic chemistry research of bodi ly fluids pointed to presence of fluoxetine in blood and urine. Quantitative measurement of fluoxetine concentration in blood wasnÃ¢ÂÂt made because of insufficient volume of blood. Conclusions: Fluoxetine use may cause toxic drug accumulation thus leading to worsening of suicidal thoughts if taken by teenagers with possible genetic determined insufficiency of CYP2D6 enzyme (poor metabolizer).",2015

Metformin is a substrate of organic cation transporters (Octs), espe cially Oct1, Oct3 (liver) and Oct2 (kidney), which determines the pharmaco kinetics/dynamics of metformin and thus its action. There is a great variabi lity in the clinical response to metformin e.g. glycaemic control, mainly due to genetic variances.

Cytochrome P4502C9 (CYP2C9) is largely responsible for terminating the anticoagulant effect of warfarin via hydroxylation of the pharmacologically more potent S enantiomer to inactive metabolites. Mutations in the CYP2C9 gene result in the expression of three variants: CYP2C9*1, CYP2C9*2 and CYP2C9*3.Main aim of this study was to evaluate the distribution of CYP2C9*1, CYP2C9*2 and CYP2C9*3 polymorphisms within patients who are candida tes for anticoagulant (warfarin) treatment. Consequently, the potential side effects of the treatment could be evaluated. We studied the random distribution of CYP2C9 polymorphisms in patients candidates for anticoagulant treatment: first patient group was consisted of patients that had at least one thrombo embolitic episode in their lifetime; second patient group was consisted of women that had recurrent sponta neous abortions (at least two).

However, APAP has a narrow therapeutic index. Even a minor over dose of APAP is associated with significant morbidity and mortality and is a major cause of acute liver failure in most western countries. Genetic variability may predispose some individuals to be at higher risk of being APAP poisoned. The aim of this study was to investigate if genetic polymorphisms in genes relevant for the metabolism of APAP are associated with the clinical outco me of an APAP overdose. Methods: A total of 102 patients admitted after APAP overdoses were en rolled in the study. A total of 94 patients were considered to have intentional and eight patients unintentional APAP overdoses.

24817,"Introduction: Janus kinase 2 (JAK2)V617F mutation is associated with myeloproliferative disorders. Its blood clonal level may be considered a dia gnostic criteria of essential thrombocythemia, polycythemia vera, primary myelofibrosis and other disorders. The early detection of this mutation in suspected patients may provide important information regarding the pre diction of the incidence of leukemic transformation and possible interven tional schemes. Materials and methods: We analyzed 30 DNA samples from patients with MPD diagnosis based on ARMS (amplification refractory mutation system) PCR method for Jak2V617F mutation detection. The i densy (Japan Ar kray 5600 system) based on automated digital HRM (High Resolution Mel ting Temperature) analysis using Q (quenching) Probes, that included di rect blood DNA extraction, automated amplification and probe alignment, further specific amplicon analysis by melting temperature differentiation through rapid automated computerized data normalization and easily re cording, as compared with ARMS PCR approach involving time consuming DNA processing steps and finally an error prone electrophoretic estimation of mutant clone burden. Results: HRM approach enabled a semiquantitative estimation of mutant clone burden which was not possible with ARMS method. Certain negative ARMS results turned in positive HRM results. Also ARMS method could not detect the benefic effect or inefficiency of treatment as HRM approach could do, by the variation of the mutant clone absorbance peak. Conlcusions: HRM i densy system proved a more sensible and semiquan titative measurement approach as compared with ARMS method based on easy sampling, automated DNA extraction, amplification and analysis steps and also on timing, repeatability and sensitivity in JAK2V617F mutation de tection.",2015

In pati ents with heart failure (HF), ivabradine reduce the risk of rehospitalization and mortality. The average heart rate (HR) reduction is 8 10 beats, but there is interindividual variability showed in clinical trials. The aim of the study is to identify variants associated with HR reduction produced by ivabradine in genes involved in the drug metabolism (CYP3A4) or related to the drug target (HCN4).Methods: In an exploratory cohort (n,11), patients who started in ivabradi ne were genotyped and the HR reduction was studied. Results: The mean HR reduction after the treatment was 18,10ÃÂ±12,26 bpm. The reduction of HR was Ã¢ÂÂ¥15bpm in 3 patients and >5 and <15bpm in 7 patients. Four synonymous variants, L12L, L520L, P852P , and P1200P , were detected in HCN4 gene (Frequency, 0.045, 0.045, and 0.681, respectively). Moreover, the CYP3A4*1F and CYP3A4*1B were found in one patient each and the CYP3A4*1G was presented in 3 patients. Conclusions: This is the first study using an exploratory pharmacogenetic approach that try to explain the interindividual variability in ivabradine HR reduction. However, more research must be done to determine the role of variants in HCN4 and CYP3A4 genes in the response to ivabradine.

24823,"Background: The most effective and common treatment for end stage re nal disease is kidney transplantation. CTLA4 may be a suitable candidate gene for studying allograft rejection. The aim of our study was to understand whether we can consider these two SNPs of CTLA4 gene as a risk factor of transplant rejection in Iranian population. Materials and Methods: 169 kidney transplant recipients who underwent transplantation before 2010 were included in this study. The patients were classified into two groups according to Acute Rejection (AR) episodes. The 318C/T and +49A/G polymorphisms in CTLA4 gene were determined by RFLP . Results: In +49 A/G polymorphism frequency of AG genotype was the same in both patients with and without history of rejection. None of those groups had homozygote genotype. Therefore, this polymorphism had no associati on with allograft rejection. In 318C/T both CT and TT frequencies among patients whose transplantations had been rejected were lower than patients with normal outcome. Although that was not sta tistically significant. Compared to CC genotype as reference, TT genotype, caused 29% increase in the odds of rejection. However, this association was not significant (OR,1.29, p,1). Conclusion: The results of our study suggest that rs231775 (+49A/G) and rs5742909 ( 318C/T) CTLA4 gene polymorphisms are not linked to acute rejection in the Iranian population who underwent kidney transplantation. So these polymorphisms cannot be considered as risk factors of acute allograft rejection in Iranian renal trans plantation recipients.",2015

Introduction: Stent implantation (ST) is one of the major treatment for in dividuals who have coronary artery disease (CAD. It is a devastating com plication of coronary stent implantation. Clopidogrel is an antiplatelet pro drug used to treat or prevent atherothrombotic events after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). It decreases the incidence of coronary artery ST . Clopidogrel resistance can be due to a genetic variation in one of the cytochrome P450 hepatic enzymes, particularly CYP2C19. Patients with po lymorphisms in this gene, have more adverse clinical events following PCI. Indeed, this gene has been independently shown to be associated with early ST . Therefore the aim of this study is to investigate the effect of CYP2C19 gene mutations to clopidogrel resistance and stent thrombosis in stent im planted CAD patients. Material Methods: 80 CAD patients who have PCI and receiving 75 mg/day clopidogrel were recruited to the study. They were divided into two groups. 40 patients who have stent thrombosis were recruited to the first group, others were recruited to the second group. After DNA was isolated from pe ripherial blood, CYP2C19 mutations were investigated with RT PCR. Results were evaluated statistically. Results: 8 heterozygous and 1 homozygous CYP2C19*2 mutations and 1 he terozygous CYP2C19*3 mutations were found in the first group. CYP2C19*2 mutations were found statistically significant in the first group when they were compared with second group. Conclusion: It is possible to recommend CAD patients for increasing the dosage of clopidogrel or using other efficient drugs for preventing stent thrombosis. Therefore genetic screening of CAD patients for CYP2C19 gene mutations will help the improvement of personilized therapy strategies.",2015

Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is a myeloproliferative disorder of hema topoietic stem cells carrying the Philadelphia (Ph) chromosome and an on cogenic BCR ABL1 fusion gene. Oncogene and tumor suppressor microRNAs (miRNAs) are important regulators of transcription in hematopoiesis. Their expression deregulations were described in association with pathogenesis of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), although they are still not fully under stood. Our study was performed to assess and validate selected group of miRNAs in peripheral blood of patients for early detection and confirmation of found differences between patients with clinically defined CML phases and patients with uncorfirmed diagnosis. On mononuclear cells isolated from peripheral blood of CML positive versus CML negative patients, miRNA microarray analysis was performed. Selected miRNAs were validated by qRT PCR. Using microarrays we identified differential expression profiles of 46 upregulated and 24 downregulated miRNAs in suspect CML patients at diagnosis distinguishing CML positive patients and patients with uncorfir med diagnosis. Significantly increased expression of miR 17, miR 18a, miR 19a, miR 20a, miR 21, miR 27a and miR 155 in CML positive compared to CML negative patients and healthy individuals was confirmed by real time quantitative PCR.

24831,"The extensive knowledge of the interindividual variability of the human genome paved the path for the development of the personalized medici ne, based on the employment of personal genomic signatures as predicti ve, diagnostic and pharmacogenetic biomarkers (PGBMs). One of the most successful applications of PGBMs into the clinical practice is the genetic screening for the HLA B*57:01 allele, which is strongly associated with a high risk of Hypersensitivity Reaction (HSR) to Abacavir (an antiretroviral drug for HIV treatment). Given the clinical utility of HLA B*57:01 screening in decreasing the incidence of drug HSR, the test became mandatory prior Abacavir administration. Taking into account the limits of the current ty ping methodologies, the aim of our work was the development and valida tion of a fast, easy to use and inexpensive molecular approach for the HLA B*57:01 allele detection. In our assay the DNA extraction and amplification are combined in one single step and performed directly on the biological sample (Direct PCR), without needing any extraction/purification and se quencing procedures. The Direct PCR phase consists of the amplification of HLA B*57 region and allows to discriminate HLA B*57 negative patients (~90%), who are eligible for Abacavir therapy.

24832,"Introduction: Despite significant advances over the last decade in our un derstanding of the basis of disease, the cause underpinning the majority of human disorders remains fully or partially unknown. Identification of molecular changes provides a unique opportunity to understand their role in health and disease, and in a clinical setting to apply that understanding to prevention, diagnosis, and treatment. Materials and Methods: The advent of high throughput genome wide se quencing has significantly altered how genetics is practised in the clinic. We have been applying clinical genome wide sequencing (GWS; encompassing both whole genome and whole exome) within our genomic medicine clinics at MCW and CHW for more than 4 years. Results: With application of both whole genome and whole exome sequen cing technology and development of advanced informatics solutions we have been able to successfully diagnose more than a third of our patients. This includes many who would not have received a diagnosis through the previous standard of care testing. The diagnostic success rate is significantly higher with whole genome sequencing compared to whole exome. Conclusions: This talk will provide a discussion of issues relevant to clinical application of genomics. Topics will include the development of informatics tools, methodologies, and decision making processes. Vignettes based on findings from particular cases will be presented to demonstrate what we have learnt over this time as well as to highlight ongoing challenges and fu ture tasks.",2015

But sometimes molecular detection of diseases such as eye disorders is very challenging, because of involving numerous genes. For instance, the re are more than 200 known genes causing retinopathy. Hunting the right gene in these complex disorders is like finding the needle in the haystack. Nevertheless, modern sequencing platforms known under collective name Next generation sequencing or NGS is a huge help to solve this problem. One of great benefits of NGS is to see a list all candidate genes including disease causing gene mutations. On the other hand, accuracy of NGS is extremely depending on frequency and length of reads. So, NGS platforms that pro duce and sequence longer length show fewer errors. However, sequencing of terminals is generally a weak point in all NGS platforms. We experienced due analysis numerous NGS data that results are sometimes not valid (at least in most cases) within repeat sequences or stretches of single bases. For instance, in a Retinitis Pigmentosa (RP) case we found a homozygous inser tion of single C within repeated sequence CCCCCCC in the NR2E3 gene that ABSTRACTS PUBLISHED ABSTRACTS ESHG 2015 | GLASGOW, SCOTLAND, UK | WWW.

24834,"Introduction: DownÃ¢ÂÂs syndrome commonly results from total trisomy of chromosome 21 (T21). To study the dysregulated gene expression without the noise of genomic variability, we previously used fibroblasts from a pair of monozygotic twins discordant for T21 and revealed the transcriptomic dysregulation between twins is organized in chromosomal domains[1]. These findings lead us to further investigate the translational profiles due to the supernumerary T21 in fibroblasts. Materials and Methods: We used SWATH MS[2], a novel mass spectrometry technique providing unprecedented reproducibility and quantitative ac curacy for proteomic analysis. The primary fetal skin fibroblasts collected from the T21 discordant twins and fibroblasts from 11 unrelated T21 and 11 control individuals were analyzed. Results: We reproducibly quantified 3,548 unique proteins assigned by 32,753 peptides between the T21 and Normal twin (R,0.979 between bio replicates). The protein transcript quantitative correlation was ~0.40. The detectable 32 proteins encoded in chromosome 21 on average harbored a higher expression in T21, whereas globally only ~40% of the proteome showed higher expression in T21. Interestingly, 291 proteins (most are non chr21 encoded) were significantly up regulated in T21, while only 63 proteins were significantly down regulated. Moreover, GO processes such as translational initiation and protein transport were significantly enhanced in T21 proteome (P<0.0001), indicating the translational regulation resulting from the extra chromosome is remarkably extensive. Conclusions: We discovered prevalent proteomic consequences of T21 by SWATH MS. Further investigations are ongoing to increase the proteome coverage and to understand the biological correlations between the tran scriptome and proteome. [1]Letourneau, A., et al. Nature (2014).

24835,"The human genome consists of approximately 21,000 protein coding genes. We hypothesized there exists an organized means for transcription machi nery to locate a specific gene. Transcription Binding Protein (TBP) is an in itial transcription factor that binds to DNA to commence assembly of the transcription complex. TBP attaches to the DNA in the vicinity of the TATA box upstream from the transcription start site (TSS). Frequently there exists 25 nucleotides between the TATA box and the TSS. 25 nucleotides would be sufficient to uniquely identify 200,000 differing genes for 5 billion species. It is estimated 25% of human genes have a TATA box upstream from the TSS. We hypothesized there may be a unique numbering system associated with a subset of genes, and DNA may be divided into executable genes (locatable gene associated with a unique identifier) and follower genes (transcribed automatically following transcription of an executable gene). Eight human genes with a TATA box and four viral genomes which embed in human DNA are reported.

Conversely, the Phylotree and Mitomap databases though updated regularly, lack functional tools for data handling, reducing its efficacy. Here, we introduce the mtMart a novel manually curated database for com plete human mitochondrial genomes that is intended to significantly faci litate effective management of large scale mitogenomic data.

Afterwards, mtMart semi automatically sends the sequence information to the Haplo find on line application to assign haplogroups according to Phylotree 16, using the RSRS reference sequence. The data on population and geographic region is manually appended to the database, thus ensuring high quality of stored information. mtMart provides the users with customizable sorting, searching and downloading functions.

Interestingly, clinical manifestations tog ether with the genes involved, pinpoint on the retinoic acid (RA) signaliza tion pathway involvement. The CYP26B1gene, which maps on minus strand of chromosome 2, is located 444kb downstream of the DYSF gene. Syntheny and relative gene positions are highly conserved through evolution. Based on the specific exploration of one patient presenting with combined clinical manifestations of ABS and Miyoshi myopathy (MM), we report that DYSF contains regulatory sequences controlling CYP26B1 expression that, when deleted, lead to ABS by a long distance position effect. Strikingly, ac tivation of CYP26B1 expression by RA is greatly reduced in lymphoblasts from one patient carrying a large internal deletion at the DYSF locus as compared to controls.

24844,", Ahvaz, Iran, Islamic Republic of. Introduction: Thyroid carcinoma is the most common endocrine malignan cy in worldwide. Hypermethylation of suppressor genes considered as the hallmark of cancers [1]. Rap1Gap as a suppresser gene is implicated in the regulation of oncogenic pathways in thyroid carcinoma [2]. The objective of this study was to examine the DNA methylation pattern of Rap1Gap gene in thyroid carcinoma. Methods: we analyzed 95 thyroid tumor samples including normal thyroid (28 cases), benign nodules (29 cases), papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) (29 cases), follicular thyroid cancer (FTC) (6 cases) and Anaplastic thyroid can cer (ATC) (3 cases) from Erfan grand hospital, Tehran, Iran. Rap1Gap gene expression was assessed using SYBR Green Real Time PCR. CpG24 Island within Rap1Gap promoter region was selected; DNA methylation pattern was examined using methylation specific PCR (MSP).Results: this study showed that Rap1Gap was frequently lost or downre gulated in various types of tumors, particularly in the most invasive and aggressive forms of thyroid cancer. Downregulation could be related to pro motor hypermethylation. DNA methylation was identified in 21% of normal tissues, 86% of benign nodules, 90% of differentiated tumors (PTC, FTC) and 100% of undifferentiated tumors (ATC). Conclusion: the result of this study demonstrates that Rap1Gap is likely to serve as an important tumor suppresser gene in thyroid cells and its loss du ring aberrant methylation contributes to tumor progression and invasion.

We have studied chromosome hydroxymethylation and methylation patterns in metaphase chromosomes from IVF produced human triploid zygotes and cleavage stage embryos. To obtain metaphase chromosomes, zygotes and embryos were treated with 0.1% colchicines, 0.9% sodium citrate and fixed with freshly prepared 3:1 methanol:acetic acid. Using indirect immunofluo rescence, we have analyzed the localization of 5 hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) and its co distribution with 5 methylcytosine (5mC) on the QFH banded metaphase chromosomes. In zygotes, 5hmC accumulates in both parental chromosome sets, but hydro xymethylation is more intensive in poorly methylated paternal set. In mater nal set, chromosomes are highly methylated, but contain little 5hmC. Hydro xymethylation is highly region specific in both parental chromosome sets: hydroxymethylated loci correspond to R bands, but not G bands, and have well defined borders, which coincide with the R/G band boundaries. The centromeric regions and heterochromatin at 1q12, 9q12, 16q11.2 and Yq12 contain little 5mC and no 5hmC. We hypothesize that 5hmC may mark struc tural/functional genome Ã¢ÂÂunitsÃ¢ÂÂ corresponding to chromosome bands in the newly formed zygotic genome. Hydroxymethylation of R bands in zygotes can be treated as a new characteristic distinguishing them from G bands. At cleavages, chromosomes with asymmetrical hydroxymethylation of sister chromatids appear. They decrease in number during cleavages, whereas to tally non hydroxymethylated chromosomes become numerous. Thus, in the zygotic genome, 5hmC is distributed selectively and its pattern is determined by both parental origin of chromosomes and type of chro mosome bands R, G or C. At cleavages, chromosome hydroxymethylation pattern is dynamically changed due to passive and non selective overall loss of 5hmC, which coincides with that of 5mC.

We investigated if miRNAs in urine are concentrated in exosomes and whether a glomerular disease as lupus nephritis (LN) modifies the distribution pat tern. Methods: We used urine of patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) (6 active, 10 inactive and 12 absence of LN) and healthy controls (n,12), quantifying miRNAs by RT qPCR in cell free urine (CFU), exosome depleted supernatant (Sn) and exosome pellet (Exo). Selected miRNA were: ubiquitously detected in urine (miR 302d, miR 335*), kidney damage bio marker (miR 200c) and altered in glomeruli of LN (miR 146a). Vesicles were characterized by TEM, western blot and NanoSight. Results: In active LN, all miRNAs were significantly higher in Exo compared to Sn, especially miR 146a (57 fold change, p<0.01). Furthermore, com paring miRNAs of each urinary fraction among pathological groups with controls, we observed that miRNAs of Exo in active LN were significantly increased, being miR 146a the most augmented (103 fold change, p<0.001). Inactive LN only showed a significant increase for miR 146a (p<0.05). Final ly, urinary exosomal miRNA 146a had the highest diagnostic role of active LN compared to SLE without LN (AUC 0.960, p<0.01), and between active and inactive LN (AUC 0.867, p<0.05). Moreover, logistic regression was per formed for exosomal miR 146a (OR 24.00, p<0.05).Conclusions: This study confirms that urinary miRNAs are enriched in exo some containing pellet. In the presence of active LN, the quantity of miRNAs was increased, especially in isolated exosomes. MiR 146a showed high dia gnostic accuracy of active LN, underlining the importance of exosome asso ciated miRNAs as renal disease markers.",2015
24848,"HIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus) infection induces a state of immune activation associated with chronic inflammation. Chronic inflammation con tributes to the pathogenesis of many chronic medical illnesses. Membrane derived microparticles (MP), released from cell surface, are implicated in cell to cell communication. Recent data evidenced the presence of miRNAs in MP that could mediate exchange of biological information. We hypothesized that MP produced by CD4 T lymphocytes, which are target cells for HIV infection, are vehicles for miRNAs and could transfer them in receiver cells to alter the expression of numerous genes, in particular those related to inflammation. The aim of the study is to demonstrate the role of miRNAs transfer by MP in pathophysiology during HIV infection. We analyzed the expression of 375 miRNAs in CD4 T cells, in CD4 T cells derived MP and in circulating MP from HIV 1 patients receiving highly ac tive antiretroviral therapy, from never treated (naive) HIV 1 patients and from seronegative age and sex matched control individuals. This analysis showed that several miRNAs significantly differentiated HIV 1 patients from uninfected individuals. We identified 2 overexpressed miRNAs in both CD4 T lymphocytes, in CD4 T cells derived MP and in circulating MP from na ive HIV 1 patients compared to controls, which are of interest because they were described as downregulators of NF kB pathway. This study provides an opportunity to better understand mechanisms of inflammation in HIV infection.

Current theory of preeclampsia pathogenesis sta tes that it begins with poor placentation in the first trimester of pregnancy. Thus, although clinical symptoms are late, early detection of preeclampsia can be feasible at the first trimester. Recent findings suggest that circulating small non coding RNAs (ncRNAs) in the motherÃ¢ÂÂs blood may be effective markers for early diagnosis of preeclampsia, however as of yet such ncRNAs were identified only in late stages of the pregnancy and have not been im plemented in clinical practice. Furthermore, mapping ncRNA expression at an early stage of the disease might shed light on the possible mechanisms involved in the disease etiology. We have compared small ncRNAs in plasma of first trimester pregnant women with and without preeclampsia. To this end, we have performed small ncRNAs Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) of preeclampsia and con trol samples, and identified several transcripts significantly differentially expressed between the two sets.

24851,"Background: Early menarche is a risk factor for teenage depression, insulin resistance, and breast cancer in adulthood. Among the various social, econo mic, biological, and environmental factors implicated in the secular decline in age at menarche, There is growing evidence that childhood obesity is an important determinant of early menarche. Obese children have high leptin levels, and these may play a role in their earlier onset of puberty. Leptin is one of many proteins important to obesity that secreted by adipocytes in proportion to adipocyte tissue mass.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of leptin G 2548A gene polymorphism on the age at menarche in a sample of the Iranian population. Material and Methods: This study was done on 374 Iranian women from February 2012 to February 2013. The leptin genotypes were determined using PCR RFLP method and age at menarche was obtained by question naires. Data analysis was performed by SPSS version 18.Result: women carrying the AA genotype had a significantly younger age at menarche (12.47 years) than women with the AG (12.94 years) and GG (13.47 years) genotypes. Also, we found that the AA genotype frequency in women with age at menarche <13 years was higher than in women with age at menarche Ã¢ÂÂ¥13 years (OR:3.4, 95%CI:1.7 6.7, P:0.001).Conclusion: The G 2548A leptin gene polymorphism has an important role in the onset of menarche.",2015

24853,"Permanent tooth agenesis is a common human anomaly of complex etiology that affects approximately 7 %, based on population based study (OMIM: #106600, #604625). It may occur independently, or as one feature of a syn drome. The non syndromic forms may be sporadic or familial with preva lence varying by tooth type. According to severity, selective tooth agenesis can be divided into hypodontia, and oligodontia. Hypodontia is generally defined as agenesis with absence of less than six teeth, and oligodontia is a condition in which six or more teeth are missing. Mutations in MSX1 and PAX9 are associated with specific forms of tooth agenesis. In the dental mes enchyme, MSX1 is detected in the dental epithelia during the tooth develop ment, and PAX9 is expressed in the neural crest derived mesenchyme of the maxillary and mandibular arches. In addition, several lines of observation have indicated that mutations in isolated tooth agenesis were detected in AXIN2, EDA, and WNT10A. Here we report mutation analyses of four candi date genes (MSX1, PAX9, WNT10A, AXIN2) in 72 probands (32 hypodontia and 40 oligodontia) in Japanese. A mean number of missing teeth was 7.1. We identified 17 mutations. Together with our previous reports, we have identified seven mutations in MSX1, two in PAX9, six in AXIN2, and two in WNT10A. MSX1 and PAX9 mutations were identified in 32.2%, and 54.5% of cases, respectively. Our findings on the intra oral distribution of agenesis of permanent teeth in children may help us better understand the etiology of agenesis.",2015

Introduction: Down syndrome is the most common autosomal aneuploidy syndrome. Total incidence (including prenatally and postnatally diagnosed cases) of the Down syndrome in the Czech Republic is increasing during the last two decades. The two mainly discussed causal factors are the improve ment of the prenatal screening/diagnostics methods and the eminent in crease of the average maternal age. Methods: Retrospective population based analysis of the prenatally dia gnosed cases of the Down syndrome in the Czech Republic (1998 2011 time period). Total number of 2 110 cases were analyzed. Results: The relative number of the prenatally diagnosed cases of the Down syndrome has increased from 10.82 per 10 000 (in 1998) to 20.24 per 10 000 (in 2011), while the incidence in births has decreased from 6.41 (in 1998) to 3.50 (in 2011, relative numbers per 10 000 are given). The average gestation week at the time of prenatal diagnosis of the Down syndrome has decreased from 19.98 (in 1998) to 15.55 (in 2011). In 1998 the majority of Down syndrome cases were diagnosed in 20 22th week of gestation, while in 2011 the diagnosis was made mainly in 12 13th week of gestation. Conclusion: We have found significant changes in the prenatal diagnostics of the Down syndrome. While in 1998 2003 time period the Down syndrome was diagnosed early in elder women (women aged 35 years or over who chose karyotyping because of advanced maternal age indication) we have not found this connection in the 2004 2011 time period. This change re presents the increasing role of the first trimester prenatal screening in the Czech Republic.",2015

The molecular genetics research showed the presence of major mutations specific and of ten found among people of Yakut origin. One of the major problems for now is to do a screening for the found mutations, diagnostics of the diseases and to organize preventive care. In collaboration with colleagues from Ã¢ÂÂAlcor BioÃ¢ÂÂ Co Ltd., Saint Petersburg, Russia there was established a testing system based on DNA microarray for the diagnostics of five high frequency diseases among Yakuts. This method has a lot of advantages and the main one is a possibility to screen several mutations at once comparing to routine methods such as PCR and restric tion. It makes the diagnostics simple, fast and money saving. There were five diseases with point mutations chosen:1. Enzymopathic methemoglobinemia (OMIM 250800, Pro269Leu mutation in DIA1 gene)2. 3 M syndrome (OMIM 273750, 4582insT in Cul7 gene).3. SOPH syndrome (OMIM 614800, G5741 A in NAG gene).4.

The study involved 483 Russian athletes (49 strength athletes, 103 endurance athletes and 331 athletes from other sports with strength component: 89 sprinters, 38 strength/speed athletes, 64 wrestlers, 42 rugby players, 98 rowers/kayakers/canoeers) and 173 controls. HumanOmni1 Quad BeadChips (Illumina Inc, USA) were used for genotyping of 1,140,419 SNPs in Russian athletes and controls. Initially, 43 SNPs associated with elite strength athlete status (when compared with controls) with P<10 5 were identified, but none of them reached genome wide significance level. Adding three criteria, i) an increase of the frequency of effect allele with increase of the level of achievement of strength athletes; ii) significant differences in allelic frequencies between strength athletes and endurance athletes; iii) at least one replication of association between effect alleles and predisposition to other sports with strength component, resulted in remaining eight SNPs (SUCLA2 rs10397 A, MED4 rs7337521 A, GPC5 rs852918 A, GABRR1 rs282114 A, CACNG1 rs1799938 A, ARHGEF28 rs17664695 G, WAPAL rs4934207 G, MPRIP rs6502557 A alleles) with P va ABSTRACTS PUBLISHED ABSTRACTS ESHG 2015 | GLASGOW, SCOTLAND, UK | WWW.

The 17 families were exclusively native of Sidi Bouzid and Gafsa, from specific delegations of these two towns: Bir El Hafey, Meknassy, Regueb, Sidi Bouzid, Gafsa and Mdhilla. 16 among 17 index cases were homozygous for the c.1070A>G mutation (UGT1A1*16) and for the TA insertion in the TATA box of the UGT1A1 gene promoter, resulting in TA7/TA7 genotype (2 UGT1A1*28 alleles or 2 A(TA7)TAA alleles or 7/7 homozygous genotype) or TA8/TA8 genotype particularly for some patients from Gafsa. Mutations were located on the same chromosome, as the ana lysis of the index patient reveals. 15 parents and related families members were heterozygous carriers of the TA insertion and the linked c.1070A>G mutation.

The (incomplete) list of populations migrated there includes Scyphians, ancient Greeks, Romans, Hunns, Gots, Tatars, and Russians. We collected 400 DNA samples from unrelated male volunteers representing two main indigenous populations in Crimea: Crimean Tatars (Steppe, Mountain, and Coastal sub ethnic groups) and Crimean Greeks (Urum and Romei sub ethnic groups).We analyzed Crimean populations by Y chromosomal markers, full mito chondrial genomes and genome wide autosomal markers. The results provi ded by all three genetic systems virtually coincided. We revealed three main features in Crimean gene pools. First, Mountain and Coastal Crimean Tatars and both Crimean Greeks populations are characterized by genetic compo nent predominant in East Mediterranean peoples, especially in Greeks and Turks. Second, Steppe Crimean Tatars carry the contrasting genetic compo nent, which is typical for Turkic populations from Eurasian steppe. Third, all indigenous Crimean populations do not show notable genetic similarity with their closest geographical neighbors Ukrainians and Russians. We conclude, that present day gene pool of indigenous Crimean populations reflects the distant echo of marine Greek colonization in antique epoch and steppe expansion of Mongol civilization in medieval epoch.

24869,"Prostate cancer (PCa) is the second most commonly diagnosed cancer among men and also the sixth leading cause of cancer related mortality. Still, genetic factors contributing to PCa susceptibility remain largely unknown. Even though a multitude of evidence supports the involvement of regulato ry mechanisms based on activity of microRNAs in prostate carcinogenesis, to date, genetic variants in microRNA genes have been evaluated as poten tial PCa susceptibility loci in only few populations, none of European ori gin. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate potential association of rs3746444 in hsa miR 499 and rs11614913 in hsa miR 196a2 with PCa risk and progression. The study population included 354 PCa patients and 354 patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) from whom blood samples were obtained, as well as 311 healthy controls derived from gene ral population who provided buccal swabs. Genotyping of rs3746444 and rs11614913 was performed by PCR RFLP and HRMA, respectively. The re sults did not support the association of analyzed genetic variants with PCa risk. Also, these genetic variant were not found to be associated with the standard prognostic parameters of PCa progression (serum PSA level at dia gnosis, Gleason score and clinical stage according to TNM classification sy stem). Nevertheless, rs3746444 minor allele G was shown to be associated with the lower risk of PCa progression (according to DÃ¢ÂÂ Amico criteria) under recessive genetic model.

ORG 473Back to inde x fertility and lifespan in humans, but the genetic basis of this phenomenon is not clear. The variation of three genes in steroid hormone metabolism, CYP17 (rs743572), HSD17B1 (rs 605059) and COMT (rs4680), was exami ned to elucidate the genetic basis of the relationship between fertility and lifespan. A sample of 277 individuals (mean age, 82.9 years) was recruited in 2000. Based on mortality data collected in 2009, the sample was divided into two groups of subjects surviving to over 90 years (long lived) or not (controls). Fertility data (number of children) were collected in the same sample. CYP17 and COMT gene variation did not influence either lifespan or fertility. The HSD17B1AA genotype was found to be significantly associated (p,0.0085) with longevity only in females (estimated odds ratio , 3.77). As the HSD17B1AA genotype was also associated with a higher number of children (5.3ÃÂ±2.1) than the other genotypes (p, 0.006), we may infer that HSD17B1 genotypes could exert a positive pleiotropic action on longevity and fertility. We then searched the literature for genes studied in relation to both reproduction and aging. A review of the studies showed a pleiotropic action for six out of sixteen genes and revealed that genes may exert posi tive, or negative, or antagonistic pleiotropic actions. These actions may be modified by environmental factors such as changing reproductive behavi ors, which seem to be able to mitigate or to enhance the gene phenotypic effects.",2015
24875,"Genome wide association studies (GWAS) are usually assessed using regres sion models, assuming additive mode of transmission. This choice leads to a significant loss of power in case of departure from additivity. We propose a General Regression Model (GRM) allowing detection of association without making hypothesis of the mode of transmission. Additionally, GRM permits the simultaneous estimation of the underlying genetic model. We compared the power of GRM to additive and other classical regression association tests under a large panel of genetic models. Powers were estimated by simulation of a 2000 cases and 2000 controls sample for qualitative traits and a sample of 5000 cases for quantitative traits. Four association tests (GRM, additive, recessive or dominant tests) were applied to all replicates. The genetic underlying mode of transmission was then tested using GRM. For both qualitative and quantitative trait, we showed that GRM powers to detect association was similar or greater to that of the additive test. In the case of recessive inheritance, gain of power up to 66% for qualitative and to 93% for quantitative traits respectively. The correct underlying model was determined in most cases. GRM test appears powerful to detect association, as much as or even more than the classically used additive test, especially in case of recessive inhe ritance. This test is easily applied to GWAS and may be used to analyze or re analyze new or existing GWAS datasets to identify new susceptibility loci involved in complex diseases.",2015

24877,"Rapid progress in whole exome and whole genome sequencing technologies provides new opportunities for detecting rare variants that control complex traits. In this context, region based association analysis is a more powerful tool for gene mapping than testing of individual genetic variants. Several ap proaches to regional association analysis have been developed recently and are increasingly used. However, there is still a lack of handy and powerful software tools for regional association analysis, especially for family data. Here we present a new and effective tool for family based regional associa tion analysis. It offers several known high performance regional associa tion tests: famBT (burden test on family data based on collapsing genetic variants), FFBSKAT (fast family based sequence kernel association test), FFBSKAT optimal, and famFLM (functional data analysis approach based on functional linear models on family data). For all these tests, the statisti cal properties and run time performance have been extensively studied in recent years. High statistical power was shown under realistic simulation models, while the fast computation performance enables analysis of a whole exome within a reasonable time even on a single PC. All tests allow for covariates and non additive models, parallel or sequential calculation modes and run time estimation. They also offer extensive lists of specific analysis options with optimal default values. This makes FREGAT a simple, flexible, fast and effective tool for regional association analysis in related samples.

Information from aDNA is very useful in phylogenetics, paleoan thropology or genealogy. The isolation and analysis of aDNA is accompanied by two major problems: low quality and quantity of aDNA and the risk of contamination with modern DNA. Therefore, several strict laboratory and methodological criteria must be followed. The aim of this study is to isolate and analyze aDNA from human remains of the small Avar Slavic population living in 9th century and to determine mitochondrial haplogroups in order to estimate the ratio of haplogroups typical for these two ethnicities. Material and methods: The 50 samples of human teeth and bones were used for the isolation of aDNA in this experiment. The samples were excavated from Avar Slavic burial site located near CÃÂ­fer PÃÂ¡c (Slovakia). Isolation of aDNA were performed in recommended conditions. Mitochondrial haplo groups were determined by sequencing of the HVRI of mtDNA followed by analysis of polymorphisms in this region. Results: Despite the fact that the graves of mentioned burial place contained Avar artefacts and some remains showed mongoloid cranial features, majo rity of detected mitochondrial haplogroups belong to the common lineages of the Slavic populations and only presence of haplogroup U7 (typical for region of Near East) indicate the Avar origin. Conclusion: Our results suggest that the assimilation between Avars and other neighbour ethnicities was too extensive in 9th century and, therefore the presence of haplogroups characteristic for Avars is very rare.",2015

Addressing this knowledge gap might point to new therapeutic targets for allergic disease. The aim of this study was to identify the target gene(s) and the functional variant(s) underlying the association between rs7009110 on chromosome 8q21 and allergies. Eight genes are located within 1 Mb of rs7009110. Multivariate association analysis of publicly available exon expression levels from lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) identified a signi ficant association between rs7009110 and the expression of a single gene: PAG1 (P,0.0017), 732 kb away. Analysis of histone modifications and DNase I hypersensitive sites in LCLs identified four putative regulatory elements (PREs) in the region. Chromosome conformation capture confirmed that two PREs interacted with the PAG1 promoter, one in allele specific fashion. To determine if these PREs were functional, LCLs were transfected with PAG1 promoter driven luciferase reporter constructs. PRE3 acted as a tran scriptional enhancer for PAG1 exclusively when it carried the rs2370615:C allergy predisposing allele, a variant in complete linkage disequilibrium with rs7009110. As such, rs2370615, which overlaps RelA and Oct 2 tran scription factor (TF) binding in LCLs and is predicted to disrupt the motif of five Forkhead TFs, represents the putative functional variant in this locus. Our studies suggest that the risk associated allele of rs2370615 predisposes to allergic disease by increasing PAG1 expression which may promote B cell activation and have a pro inflammatory effect. Inhibition of PAG1 expression or function may have therapeutic potential for allergic diseases.",2015

Aim: To study the haemostatic alterations in SCD patients during clinical and sub clinical thrombotic manifestations. Methods: We investigated 71 cases of SCD patients in steady state or follo wing an episode of venous thrombosis. Plasma levels Antithrombin III,[AT] Protein S and C, Activated protein C resistance, and genetic screening of Fac tor V Leiden, [FVL] MTHFR mutation(C677T) and CBS mutation(844ins68) was performed in 37 patients. Results: We observed a significant reduction in Protein S and C in 18( 48.6%)and 16( 43.2%) cases respectively. Ten patients(27%) showed a reduction of both Protein S and C levels.

Within last three years the high throughput sequencing technologies yield large datasets on Y chromosomal variation in humans. Reliable estimation of the base substitution rate is crucial for applying these data for dating po pulation events. To estimate the mutation rate different approaches were used: human chimpanzee comparisons (the evolutionary approach), ana lysis of the deep rooting pedigree (the genealogical approach), adjusting the autosomal mutation rates, and using archeological dates of founding migrations (the calibration approach). We applied the independent Ã¢ÂÂclan basedÃ¢ÂÂ approach using the historical dates of life of the tribe clan founder and number of mutations accumulated among the clan members to count the mutation rate. We genotyped 367 representatives of the Kazakh tribe Argyn by 45 SNP and 17 STR Y chromosomal markers and found haplogroup G1 M285 with fre quency 68%. The Argyn includes around 500,000 members claiming their ancestry from Karakhoja who is historical person lived 600 years ago. We applied the BigY technology (FamilyTreeDNA, Ltd) to sequence ~11 Mb of the Y chromosomes of representatives of the 9 clans. The reconstructed genetic tree of these Y chromosomes perfectly fits the ge nealogical tree. This finding indicates the biological reality of the genealogy thus allowing calculate the Y chromosomal mutation rate. The SNP substi tution rate was 0.78ÃÂ10^ 9 per bp per year, falling within the range of pu blished rates.

24889,"IntroductionAs part of the service offered by the Cardiff Sickle Cell & Thalassaemia Cen tre and the All Wales Medical Genetics Service, haemoglobinopathy scree ning is offered to all women presenting at the Antenatal Clinic with family origins outside of the UK. A case is presented which illustrates the testing and counselling pathways that are activated when iron deficiency is identi fied in this context. Iron deficiency in pregnancy in a woman originally from outside the UK Mrs A accepted haemoglobinopathy screening at the antenatal clinic. She and her husband were originally from Oman. Screening identified the pres ence of iron deficiency. Iron deficiency interferes with the ability to diagnose thalassaemias haema tologically. A co existing thalassaemia (most likely alpha) could therefore not be excluded without further testing. Due to the complexities of testing for alpha thalassaemias, and also the high prevalence of certain genotypes in some populations, testing was next offe red to the father of the pregnancy. Testing identified the father, Mr B, as a possible thalassaemia carrier with the presence of Haemoglobin H inclusions. Further molecular testing was carried out to exclude the possibility of Haemoglobin Barts hydrops fetalis or Haemoglobin H disease in the pregnancy. Initial testing ruled out the common forms of alpha zero thalassaemia. Mr B was subsequently identified as a carrier of homozygous alpha plus thalas saemia and Mrs A as a carrier of heterozygous alpha plus thalassaemia. It was therefore possible to counsel the couple that there was no discernible risk of a significant thalassaemia disorder in the pregnancy.",2015
24890,"Introduction: Individuals affected by autosomal dominant polycystic kid ney disease (ADPKD) are underrepresented in genetic counselling literatu re. Little is known about how individuals communicate the genetic risk of this condition to their relatives. We believe this is one of the first studies designed to explore the accounts of individuals diagnosed with ADPKD to understand: how communication to at risk relatives takes place, the factors influencing this process and if support is desired to facilitate family com munication. Materials and Methods: Data were collected via questionnaire (n ,16), semi structured interviews (n , 9) and retrospective medical records review (n , 9) then subsequently analysed using thematic analysis. Results: Participants indicated several unmet needs, the most significant of which was a lack of information. Retrospective accounts showed that they recalled little to no information about ADPKD being shared with them by medical professionals at the time of diagnosis or at subsequent follow up appointments. The results also suggested that despite current literature proposing the benefits of early intervention to reduce or slow kidney dama ge, the majority of participants were not aware of this information. Conclusion: The study emphasises how misunderstandings and lack of in formation about ADPKD can influence genetic risk discussion within the family. Awareness of patient accounts may enhance the services designed to educate and support individuals with this condition as well as informing medical personnel who provide care to this population.",2015

The Italian National Centre for Rare Diseases, at the IstitutoSuperiore di Sa nitÃÂ , provides the Italian External Quality Assessment (IEQA) in genetic te sting since 2001. Currently, IEQA covers three molecular genetic tests: Cystic Fibrosis (CF), Beta Thalassemia (BT), Fragile X Syndrome both full (FXf) and pre screening (FXp) schemes. Since 2009 the activity has been regulated by governmental document and participation is open both to public and commercial Italian laboratories. The goal of IEQA is to ensure a good laboratories practice. Participants received four validated DNA samples with mock demographic and mock clinical indications. We ask laboratories to analyse samples and to report data using their routine protocols. Assessors review raw data and reports, sent by laboratories, taking into account genotyping, interpretati on and reporting, according to marking criteria. A category of poor perfor mance was defined. In 2014 round the number of participants was 71: 59, 13, 12, and 6 labora tories participated for CF, BT , FXf and FXp respectively.

24892,"Introduction: In the Netherlands, pregnant couples at increased risk of trisomies 21, 13 and 18 may choose between invasive prenatal diagnosis (PND) and non invasive prenatal testing (NIPT). Pre test counseling, essen tial for informed decision making, is currently reserved to obstetricians at academic hospitals. Presumably, in the near future all pregnant couples will be offered access to NIPT , leading to an increase in the demand for pre test counselors. Our study aims to investigate whether midwives may perform pre test counseling as adequately as academic obstetricians. Methods: Ten midwives from a regional first tier practice will receive a tailor made training aimed at learning to offer pre test counseling for NIPT and PND. Couples at an increased risk of common aneuploidies will subsequent ly receive pretest counseling by a midwife and fill in an online questionnaire. The same questionnaire was administered to a group of couples counselled by an academic obstetrician. Data from both groups will be compared in order to assess whether pregnant couples counselled by midwives make equally informed decisions and whether choices, motivation and psycholo gical distress differ from pregnant couples counselled by obstetricians. Results: The training we develop comprises both theoretical knowledge and counselling skills. Our poster will present the development and content of this training. Discussion: This study will reveal whether midwives have comparable skills and counseling results for NIPT counseling as compared to obstetricians. If so, the training we developed may be used for this purpose. If not, empiri cal evidence will support why the pre test counseling license should remain with academic obstetricians.

24893,"The fundamental and the only purpose of genetic counseling is genetic dia gnostics. This means associating certain illnesses with certain genetic mu tations. This has been the main purpose of genetic methods ever since they have been used in diagnostics, no matter how big the mutations are, such as changes in the number or structure of chromosomes, monogenic illnesses or microarray diagnostics. However in all of these event, the genetic test focuses on answering one specific question. However with the appearance of next generation genetic sequencing (WGS whole genome sequencing, WES whole exome sequencing) we have gained the ability to directly associate certain genetic variations with certain of ten complex diseases sometimes even without earlier targeting of a speci fic gene. A good example is personal genetic sequencing which allows an individual to figure out if he carries the risk of developing certain illnesses. Nevertheless there are countless genetic variations from harmful ones to harmless ones. Due to this fact if WGS WES are going to become the dia gnostic methods of the future it is essential that we target specific genetic variation which are the cause of dieses . Nevertheless like every other sci entific method, WGS and WES and even genetic diagnostics as whole, can be manipulated and misused. This is why we would like to point out certain problems that may occur and the solutions to these problems, also we would like to help out future genetic counselors.",2015
24894,"Introduction: Although not routinely offered for psychiatric disorders in the UK, there is growing awareness that psychiatric genetic counselling (PGC) may serve as an important tool in bridging the current gap between psychia tric genetic information and clinical application. In addition to conventional outcomes of traditional genetic counselling including increasing aetiologi cal understanding and provision of recurrence risks PGC has positive psy chotherapeutic outcomes through reducing feelings of shame, stigma and guilt associated with mental illness. This ultimately facilitates adaptation to the mental illness and reduces emotional burden, improving psychiatric outcomes. However there is a lack of awareness and misconceptions exi sting amongst the general public about the purpose of genetic counselling, and research has shown this can influence uptake and outcomes of genetic counselling sessions. Thus a potential gap exists in the future delivery of PGC services. Method: Quantitative methods will be employed to explore a) current un derstanding about aetiology of mental illness b) perceptions of genetic risk c) perceptions of and attitudes towards genetic counselling and PGC, amongst UK individuals with psychiatric illness and their relatives. This will indicate i) whether PGC may be useful to this population; and ii) whether there is hypothetical interest in receiving PGC. Results: This study will collect empirical data to assess and inform the futu re application of PGC to the UK. Conclusion: This research will provide empirical evidence of whether the UK public want and would benefit from PGC. This will help inform policy makers on how to integrate this service into the current healthcare system.",2015
24895,"Non invasive prenatal testing (NIPT) for aneuploidy is currently being eva luated for use within the NHS. Previous research has highlighted concerns around routinisation of testing because of the ease with which the test can be conducted. We adapted a measure of informed choice, originally develo ped for use with women being offered Down syndrome screening, specifical ly for use with NIPT . The measure includes questions to assess knowledge, attitude, deliberation and test uptake, delivered in a questionnaire format. An informed choice is one in which there is good knowledge, deliberation, a positive attitude and NIPT uptake, or a negative attitude and NIPT is decli ned. The responses are calculated to provide a yes/no answer. The measure is being distributed to women recruited across seven antenatal clinics in England taking part in a study to evaluate NIPT in the NHS (www.rapid.nhs. uk). The sample includes women with a high (1:2 1:150) or intermediate (1:151 1:1000) DSS risk. Currently, 521 questionnaires have been comple ted. Our results indicate that the vast majority (89%) of women are making an informed choice around NIPT . Of the 11% who were judged to have made an uninformed choice, 54% had not deliberated, 44% had insufficient know ledge, and 17% had a negative attitude. Ethnicity was found to be a signi ficant predictor of informed choice. The high rate of informed choice is likely to reflect the importance placed on the provision of pre test counselling in this study. It will be vital to ensure this is maintained once NIPT is offered in routine clinical practice.",2015
24896,"Myotonic Dystrophy Type 1 (DM1) is a dominantly inherited muscle conditi on predominantly characterised by muscle weakness and the phenomenon of anticipation, whereby there is increased severity of symptoms and earlier age of onset in successive generations. Anticipation is variable, highly un predictable and may result in the birth of children severely affected with congenital myotonic dystrophy. This adds complexity to genetic counselling which may be further complicated as some patients with DM1 also have mild learning difficulties. The aim of this study was to explore communica tion between health professionals and patients with DM1, the understan ding of Anticipation and how this may affect decisions about reproductive options. Using qualitative research methods, five interviews were conduc ted and analysed with six participants who had previous genetic counsel ling regarding anticipation with a genetics health professional. In addition thematic analysis was used to analyse clinical letters. This study confirmed important factors within understanding such as the importance of the clini cian relationship and understanding from personal experience. This study also showed that though Anticipation as a concept appears well understood in this small group, patients did not understand the terminology. In addi tion other concepts such as chance are largely misunderstood in patients with learning difficulties. Therefore this study identifies important areas for further research into DM1 patient understanding of genetic concepts, particularly focusing on how this may affect reproductive decisions, on a much larger scale. In addition this study highlights that there is a significant lack of research within the genetic counselling of individuals with learning difficulties. Grant References: FfWG & YLCE",2015
24897,"The emergence of next generation DNA sequencing (NGS) techniques creates new moral dilemmas, among which the question whether and to whom genetic information should be returned. Whereas consensus now exists that at least some subsets of genetic information should be disclosed ABSTRACTS PUBLISHED ABSTRACTS ESHG 2015 | GLASGOW, SCOTLAND, UK | WWW. ESHG. ORG 478Back to inde x to patients, communication of genetic information to family members be cause of hereditary risk is less consensual. This issue becomes especially salient after the patient has died, and permission to inform relatives cannot be asked anymore. In this paper we first identify and explain the arguments in favor of and against disclosure of genetic information to a deceased patientÃ¢ÂÂs relatives. The principles of beneficence, the duty to warn and the familial nature of genetic information could provide justification for postmortem disclosure. Furthermore, disclosure may have the favorable side effect of fostering a relativeÃ¢ÂÂs positive autonomy. Postmortem disclosure could however be in conflict with the deceasedÃ¢ÂÂs privacy. Moreover, communication of genetic information could disregard the deceasedÃ¢ÂÂs wishes or have harmful conse quences for relatives and violate a relativeÃ¢ÂÂs interest in not knowing. Finally, postmortem disclosure may not always be feasible. When balancing these different types of arguments we conclude that there are strong justificati ons for postmortem disclosure. Potential objections are manifold but none of them supplies compelling fundamental reasons against postmortem dis closure. There are however important competing values that need to be ta ken into account. Therefore we propose a passive postmortem disclosure policy offering relatives access to genetic information if certain conditions are met.",2015
24898,"The need for participants in biomedical research, including clinical trials and genetics studies, pushes organizations to actively promote and engage the public and patients in research. In order to overcome the current difficulties of participant recruitment, web registries and platforms are being developed to collect personal health data, and to match potential research volunteers with researchers. As a pioneer in the field, the research advocacy organization Genetic Alliance launched, in 2013, the initiative Reg4ALL (Registries for ALL). Because website, blogs and social media channels are essential to keep the momentum of public engagement, we analysed the activity of the main communication channels of promotion of Reg4ALL. We found that whereas the communication effort was substantial for the launch in April 2013 and during the following 6 months, communication has decreased dramatically since December 2013. This raises the question of how active or sustainable this initiative is? And, what does it mean for the research data that have already been collected? More pragmatically, what return of investment, if any, individuals who have uploaded their data may expect from the initiative? The case of Reg4ALL raises general questions on the responsibility of research-oriented platform providers regarding the benefits claimed for their users and on patient and public engagement in research.This research is supported through an Erasmus Mundus scholarship from the European Commission and in part by the Swedish Foundation for Humanities and Social Sciences.",2015
