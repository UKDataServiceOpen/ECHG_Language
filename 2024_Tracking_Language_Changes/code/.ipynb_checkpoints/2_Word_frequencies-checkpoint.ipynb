    "\n",
    "Now that we have some basic descriptive stats about how many abstracts were imported properly with text in the 'Text' column, we can get on to the actual natural language processing steps. The most basic NLP option is to count the most frequent words found in the two sets of abstracts - meaning we need to find the most frequent words found in ALL of the abstracts and then compare that to the most frequnet words found in only those abstracts that contain a keyword of interest. \n",
    "\n",
    "To this end, we use the 'bag of words' method which whacks all of the words from all of the texts together, turns them into 'tokens' then processes to make them as unified as possible by removing uppercase letters, punctuation, digits, empty strings, stop words (e.g. 'the', 'and', 'for', etc. ) and word forms (e.g. pluralisations, verb endings, etc. ). \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's demo this with a simple example. If the text we want to 'bag of words' is \"The cat named Cat was one of 5 cats.\" it would become a list of stemmed word-tokens like \n",
    "'''[[cat]\n",
    "[name]\n",
    "[cat]\n",
    "[be]\n",
    "[cat]]''' \n",
    "and the most common word would obviously be '''[cat]'''. \n",

We would expect that the most common words from all of the texts would be similar to, but not identical to, the most common words from only the abstracts that contain a keyword of interest.\n",
