Most disease-association studies of rCNVs have focused on haploinsufﬁciency caused by deletions, PL2.2 Local gene co-expression measurements in single-cells whileourunderstandingoftriplosensitivitycausedbyduplications highlight inter-individual speciﬁcity remains rudimentary. We meta-analyzed rCNVs from 753,994 individualsacross30primarilyneurologicaldiseasephenotypesto DiogoRibeiro1,2,Olivier Delaneau1,2 discover 114 rCNV-disease associations at 52 distinct loci surpassing genome-wide signiﬁcance (P=3.72x10−6), 42% of 1University of Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland, 2Swiss Institute of which involve duplications. Further, we statistically ﬁne-mapped Bioinformatics (SIB),Lausanne, Switzerland. 38 novel triplosensitive disease genes (e.g., GMEB2), including three known haploinsufﬁcient genes that we now reveal as Nearby genes are often expressed as a group. Recent studies bidirectionally dosage sensitive (e.g., ANKRD11). We found that highlight the existence of regulatory domains (e.g. groups of disease-associated rCNV segments were enriched for genes enhancers) orchestrating the organised expression of nearby constrained against damaging coding variation and identiﬁed genes (Delaneau et al. 2019 Science 364(6439)). Yet, the likely dominant driver genes for about one-third (32%) of rCNV prevalence and genetic control of local gene co-expression are segments based on de novo mutations from exome sequencing far from being understood. By leveraging gene expression studies of developmental disorders. However, most of the rCNVs measurements across 49 human tissues and hundreds of showing genome-wide signiﬁcant association were incompletely individuals, we found local gene co-expression to be highly penetrant (mean odds ratio=11.6) and we also identiﬁed two prevalent,occurringin13%to53%genespertissue.Notably,we examples of noncoding disease-associated rCNVs (e.g., intronic identiﬁed>30.000expressionquantitativetraitloci(eQTLs)which CADM2 deletions).
