Loci of shared segmental aneuploidy in the genomes of In our full-service genetics consultation we see approximately 200 healthy and mentally retarded subjects detected by Array-cGH families/year for assessment of a hereditary predisposition to cancer . Most consultations concern breast /ovarian or colorectal cancers, and M. Poot, M. J. Eleveld, R. Hochstenbach, H. K. Ploos van Amstel; most gene testing comes back negative . Although textbooks suggests Department Medical Genetics, 3508 AB Utrecht, The Netherlands. that “rare cancer-predisposition syndromes” account for less than one By genome-wide segmental aneuploidy profiling with a 3,782 BAC percent of familial aggregation of cancer, our experience suggests that array we detected in a panel of 131 unrelated affected children and 21 syndromic entities may well be under-diagnosed . One such condition of their unaffected parents on average 35 autosomal loci of segmental is the Birt-Hogg-Dube (BHD) syndrome, due to mutations in the aneuploidy (SA) per subject. In total, we identified 696 distinct loci of presumed tumor-suppressor gene folliculin (FCN) on chromosome SA that were shared among patients and parents . These loci occur 17p . BHD is best known to dermatologists because of skin lesions as deletion, duplication, or both, in frequencies up to 45% within our with characteristic histology: fibrofolliculomas, trichodiscomas and study population . Subjects of Turkish and Arab/Berber origin showed acrochordons. Renal tumors, specifically oncocytomas and papillary significant overlap with Caucasians (87% and 92%, respectively). Plots renal cell carcinomas, are highly characteristic of BHD, which also of the cumulative number of shared loci of SA indicate that their total predisposes to spontaneous pneumothorax/ pulmonic cysts and to number may be finite. Loci of SA were distributed in the euchromatin benign and malignant tumors of the uterus, ovaries, breast and colon . with equal densities among Giemsa-light and Giemsa-dark bands . We describe here the clinical, genetic and histological features of Out of the 68 most frequently occurring loci of SA, 21 contained sites three families with BHD syndrome presenting to the cancer genetics of segmental duplication on the same chromosome, while 31 and 63 consultation in the same year .

The disease is caused by a mutation in death compared to wild-type Cx26 . In our study, we investigated the the PKD1 or PKD2 gene . To get insight in the crucial initial pathogenic role of wild-type Cx26 and R143W-Cx26 in epidermal wound healing events leading to cystogenesis we have created several mouse lines by focusing on key features of a regenerating epidermis . We show in which a large part of Pkd1 is either deleted, or flanked by loxP increased migration and proliferation in cells expressing R143W-Cx26 sites .

No data are available whether genetic polymorphisms play a role in bone disease development in premature infants . We performed a pilot study to analyze the possible association between bone disease in VLBW infants and allelic polymorphisms of the candidate genes for osteoporosis, and we tried to identify fetal and maternal factors influencing bone turnover. Sixty-five VLBW infants were included. Twenty infants (30 .8%) were diagnosed with bone disease based on positive radiological signs and high activity of bone formation (serum alkaline phosphatase, osteocalcin) and bone resorption (urinary excretion of calcium and pyridinolin crosslink) markers .

In the second trimester, a second blood sample was drawn at Since 1996, we received 83 requests for PND, in familial amyloid 15+3 weeks until 18+6 weeks of pregnancy to measure biochemical polyneuropathy (FAP-I) ATTRV30M (53), Huntington disease (11), markers AFP, estriol and hCG . The results of the nuchal translucency Machado-Joseph disease (4), SCA2 (2), Friedreich ataxia (11), and and the four biochemical markers were combined to calculate a risk others (2) . for Down syndrome for the second trimester. Women identified to PND was requested for the first pregnancy of 32 couples, while be screen positive (≥1/200 term risk) were managed according to 20 already had one or more children; 5 couples had 2 requests, standard practice . and one had 3 .

The congenital muscular dystrophies (CMD) are a heterogeneous Congenital sensorineural hearing loss (deafness) is a complex disorder group of autosomal recessive disorders. It is often difficult to establish that involves a high number of genes and environmental factors, a definite clinical diagnosis and offer prenatal diagnosis without which affects approximately 1/1,000 live births . Recently, there has identifying the causative mutations in one of a number of possible been enormous progress in non-syndromic deafness research with candidates . the identification of over 50 loci and 15 genes. Among these, GJB1, We currently offer a mutation screening service for the LAMA2, FKRP GJB2, GJB3, and GJB6, encode for connexin proteins as Connexin32, and SEPN1 genes. Causative mutations have been identified in 20/79 Connexin26, Connexin31, and Connexin30, respectively . Mutations individuals screened for FKRP mutations, 13/77 for SEPN1 mutations in these genes cause autosomal recessive, autosomal dominant or and we have identified LAMA2 mutations in 18/45 cases, but analysis X-linked hearing impairment, both syndromic and non-syndromic . is incomplete for the 27 cases without identified mutations. Four The mutations in GJB2 gene have been described as a major cause patients with FKRP mutations were originally referred with a diagnosis of congenital deafness and account for about 50% of all congenital of Becker muscular dystrophy, demonstrating the clinical overlap cases . with other muscular dystrophies .
